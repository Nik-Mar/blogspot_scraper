{"title": "Cold Comfort Farms", "date": "Wednesday, February 16, 2022", "text": "Ten years ago, I was working on a farm in the middle of a cold Sussex winter, trying to push some huge metal wheelie bins up an ice-covered slope. After falling over several times, I gripped onto the bins as firmly as possible, only to discover that my hands had stuck to the freezing metal. It was not the best of times.There were lighter moments. Occasionally, we'd stop for a cup of tea and see how long it took for the dregs of our cups to freeze once we'd tipped them on the ground. Meanwhile, in a nearby barn, some mice had taken the used teabags from our makeshift bin and turned them into a cosy little nest. I barely knew the people I worked with, but the grim, Siberian labour camp conditions created a sort of camaraderie. When friends asked me what I was doing, I told them a half truth: I was setting up an online secondhand bookselling business, with a man called Pete. If they wanted to imagine a rarefied atmosphere of antiquarian books, that was fine with me. The reality was harder to explain and I'm not sure I even understood it myself.It had all happened by chance. A few weeks earlier, I'd been approached by someone I vaguely knew who'd heard that I'd recently left an online bookselling job to set up my own business. Pete invited me to a local pub and, over a pint of Harvey's, produced a succession of Excel spreadsheets that showed how the two of us could make our fortune. My bookselling experience combined with his business acumen would be, he argued, be a winning combination. I wasn't convinced, but it was flattering to be asked and, after all, what did I have to lose? Pete proposed that we ran two separate, but linked, businesses, so I would still have the independence I needed, but with a guaranteed supply of books. I mulled it over that evening and said yes the following morning. The farm was 10 miles away, in the middle of the Sussex countryside and was owned by a gypsy family. For reasons I never fully understood, they all seemed to be called Billy and lived in a static home which was occasionally turned 90 degrees to the right or left, perhaps as a homage to their nomadic past.Pete had sublet a barn from the family and had established a small business selling penny paperbacks, but had no idea what to do with all of the older, non-barcoded books. My role was to go through the stock, sort out the wheat from the chaff and find a way of selling the books online. I'd already done this in my previous job, so what could possibly go wrong? I soon had my answer. Several weeks of sifting through books ridden with mouse droppings in subzero temperatures took its toll and I developed pneumonia. I hadn't taken it that seriously until I saw the look on my doctor's face after she'd tested my lung capacity. It was time to stop. The rest of February was a write-off, spent mostly in bed.By the beginning of March, I felt able to go back to work and found Pete in an ebullient mood. He had just bought a large van, which meant that we could move our stock around between different premises. All I had to do now was find a suitable location for my part of the business. How did one go about finding suitable properties to set up an internet bookselling business? I had no idea, but like any sensible person I tried Google and eventually found this. After my spell in the icy gulag, the new site felt like paradise. The owner was a gentleman farmer whose wife ran a B&B for visitors to Glyndebourne and his other tenants included the official glovemaker to the Queen. Every time I opened the door, I felt of rush of pleasure as I looked at the view:I could have quite happily spent my days sitting in this empty building, just looking at the view and listening to music. If only such jobs existed. Sadly there was rent to pay, so I had to start focusing on the nuts and bolts of the business. Literally:It took two weeks to assemble the giant Meccano sets masquerading as shelving units, one nut and bolt at a time. It was indescribably tedious and if someone had told me that I'd have to disassemble it and reassemble it somewhere else, six months later, I might have felt like giving up. Along with the shelving, there was the other minutiae to consider: postage, computers, printers, furniture, setting up a BT account, banking and stationery. Even something as simple as a packing slip required HTML skills that were way beyond my abilities, but somehow I had to learn. Gradually, it was beginning to take shape, but there was one thing missing: staff.Fast forward to a month later and it was impossibly idyllic. I was working in a beautiful rural setting with two postgrads and a member of the cast of The Archers, which added to the bucolic atmosphere. We spent our days sorting through old books in a cosy little office, accompanied by the soothing strains of a French classical music station. What more could anyone want?Sadly, it was too good to last. Our business generated a lot of waste and our landlord had made it very clear that he didn't want his B&B guests disturbed by the sight of wheelie bins, or woken up by any early morning waste collections. I couldn't argue with that. If I was in the land of Nod after a night's Gotterdammerunging, I wouldn't want a dawn chorus of \"ATTENTION! THIS VEHICLE IS REVERSING!\"So far, I'd managed to use Pete's van to take our unwanted books away, but that took two hours out of my day. Also, Pete's bargain van was rather erratic and, without any warning, things would suddenly stop working. On one occasion, I was driving to a warehouse in Birmingham and discovered that the windscreen wipers weren't functioning. I pulled over and texted Pete:\"Got to turn back. The wipers aren't working.\" Pete quickly replied: \"Is it raining?\" I replied that it wasn't, but it might start raining at some point in the journey, in which case I'd be in a bit of a pickle. I think Pete thought that I was being an old fuss-pot. The business model was simple enough. We received bulk deliveries of old, pre-ISBN books and sorted through them, identifying any titles that might be worth selling. It doesn't take long to learn which books have no value at all in the secondhand market - things like everyday bibles, old textbooks and Victorian poetry anthologies, or titles like Little Women, Reach For the Sky and anything by Walter Scott. Sadly, these books are sent off to be pulped as nobody wants them, particularly the charities who have just sold them to us as a waste product. If the books have nice covers, they may have a future lining the shelves of some faux olde worlde pub, but most will end up in places as unlikely as road surfacing material. In a normal one tonne delivery, anything up to 90% of the books end up being thrown away.I resisted leaving my rural idyll for as long as possible, but I had to face facts: the business was generating too much waste for our genteel setting. I had to find a new home for the books. After a few fruitless weeks of searching online, I found this:It was as grim as it looks in the photo, but it was big and cheap - perfect for a growing business. We could have as many wheelie bins as we liked and receive deliveries from articulated lorries. However, expecting my staff to work in a large barn, particularly as the weather got colder, was asking too much. How could I provide them with a decent office space?Fortunately, I had a brainwave:I won't claim that my garden shed idea matched the splendour of our previous office, but once I'd installed decent lighting, a couple of heaters and painted the inside a bright colour, it was tolerable. Perhaps we might have been contented there, but unfortunately things took a turn for the worse.Impressed by the size of the barn, Pete decided that he'd like to set up a little sideline there and employed the first four Polish men who responded to his Gumtree advert. They were perfectly pleasant individuals, but had a penchant for drinking vodka in the morning. Once Pawel and his chums had reached a suitable state of inebriation, they would amuse themselves by performing stunts with a forklift truck (those things can move a lot faster than you might imagine). Occasionally, the forklift would almost crash into our office, veering off seconds before impact. To add insult to injury, they played Heart FM and, on one occasion, I had to listen to Adele  accompanied by the cry of a bull being sodomised by one of its stablemates in an adjacent barn. It was at moments like this, I wondered where I had gone wrong.But in spite of my reservations, the business worked. The sales slowly but steadily grew as we added books to our inventory and received orders from all over the world. Having a global marketplace meant that even the most obscure book stood a reasonable chance of finding a buyer. In a bookshop, I strongly doubt that our 1920s book about UHT milk production would have sold, but online we found someone in Uruguay who couldn't wait to read it.After a year, I thought I'd developed a pretty good business model. The overheads were low and the turnover was growing month by month. But I hadn't foreseen that there would be a number of obstacles to our progress. Here are five of the worst:1. AnimalsBeing a townie, I was under the naive impression that we were the sole occupants of our barn, but I soon learned otherwise. From a robin's point of view, our bookshelves were just a suitable place to build a nest. When the eggs hatched, we had to tread very carefully, hoping that we wouldn't frighten the mother away from feeding her birds. This meant that if any poor soul ordered a book near the nest, I had to cancel the order. Of course, I couldn't tell them why, so I had to invent a vaguely plausible excuse and hope that our rating wouldn't suffer.After a few weeks, the birds flew away, leaving several pecked, soiled books as a souvenir of their visit.The poor Poles who worked in the open barn also had to contend with birds defecating on their computer monitors and keyboards, which must have added insult to injury. In addition to birds, we shared our barn with amphibians:But the most bizarre moment was when we saw a mink casually walk past with a rat in its mouth. The moment it noticed us, the mink jumped and let go of the rat. Seeing an opportunity, the rat scuttled off into a narrow gap by the door and hid. When we returned after the weekend, we found the mink lying dead with its legs in the air. Next to it, was a huge pile of rat droppings.Our uninvited guests may have thrown the occasional spanner in the works, but overall they provided many comedic moments and I grew to love the absurdity of it. I also cherished the moments when a robin would land a few feet away and patiently watch me unpack my deliveries. Perhaps he was hoping for a bookworm.2. CouriersI thought I'd set up a foolproof system. Rather than faffing around taking parcels to the nearest post office, I'd found a courier who would do all the hard work. All we had to do was put the UK orders in one mailsack and international orders in the other, then someone would come and collect them. It all worked very well until the day nobody turned up. After a number of unanswered phone calls, I discovered that the company had gone bust. They had several days' worth of our orders in their warehouse and for the next few weeks, I began each day issuing refunds and apologising to angry customers. Our rating dropped as a result and fewer orders came in, which was probably just as well, as there was nobody to collect them. I learned my lesson and signed up to one of the biggest couriers in the country. They went bust too.3. GravityFor no discernible reason, our Meccano shelving units would occasionally collapse under the strain of our growing inventory of books. The metal would buckle to the point where repairs were impossible. It was very annoying.Gravity also nearly led to my premature demise when this teetering pile of boxes was delivered. It looks harmless enough here, but when this half tonne pallet was five feet above me on the back of a lorry, wobbling menacingly, I wasn't terribly happy about it. The delivery driver didn't inspire confidence when he said, \"Looks as if it might fall off, mate. Can you stand underneath and try and keep it steady?\" Like a fool, I complied because I wanted to show that I was also a proper man, just like him.4. SuppliersLike couriers, suppliers can suddenly go into receivership without any warning. Even if that doesn't happen, they may decide that my few hundred quid a month isn't enough of an incentive for them to bother separating their old books from the new, preferring to sell them to a waste paper merchant.5. PartnershipBusiness partnerships are tricky at the best of times. Pete and I were like Del Boy and Rodney. Pete was a geezer and although I liked him personally, I didn't agree with the way he avoided paying people to extend his credit. Occasionally, his 'entrepreneurial' approach would land him in deep water and more than once his business teetered on the brink of disaster. I was definitely a Rodney. I used to worry if I was a day late with my payments and liked to do everything by the book. Eventually, Pete and I reached an amicable separation, but continued to help each other out and share premises. Without Pete's quest for global domination, I no longer felt under pressure to expand and decided to continue as a one-man operation. The business was at a level where it ticked over nicely and I was contented sitting in my small office, listening to music, sorting through the random selection of books that passed through my hands.The job was a strange mixture. One part of it involved sitting in a warm, cosy office, listening to Bach and looking at antiquarian books. The other involved mundane manual tasks, like trying to push heavy wheelie bins through the muddy surface of a farmyard. The physicality of the work could be particularly draining - if you've ever had to load and unload one and a half tonnes of boxed books, you'll know what I mean. But although the chores could be repetitive, the books themselves were endlessly fascinating, ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous. Although most of the stock was rubbish, literally, a delivery could yield all sorts of surprises, from a signed first edition by Siegfried Sassoon to a letter written by Paul Nash. If things had gone as planned, I'd probably still be in my cowshed now, assailed by weasels, toads and robins. However, a few years ago, my wife won funding from the local authority for our son to go to a school that specialised in teaching autistic children. As I was the only one who could take him there (and be on call to collect him if he had a wobble), my wife and I decided that we should swap roles. I tried to continue running my business on a part-time basis, but it didn't work and I very reluctantly said a final farewell to bookselling. Five years on, I am still at home, bored senseless and doing a terrible job at running the house, while my wife is developing a blossoming career as a freelance editor. Sometimes I fantasize about resurrecting Steerforth Books, even if it meant having to start from scratch again. But whenever nostalgia strikes, I remember the darker side of the job: the mud, the Heart FM, the near-death incidents, the rats and the back-breaking deliveries. And it still isn't enough to put me off."},
{"title": "Journal of a Plague Year", "date": "Sunday, August 08, 2021", "text": "2020 was going to be a good year. Holidays were booked and my older son, whose crippling anxiety had made him virtually housebound, was about to begin a programme of treatment that would gradually help him overcome his fear of the outside world. There seemed to be a lot to look forward to. Of course, there were various reports in the news about a deadly new virus in China, but hadn't we heard it all before when we were warned about mad cow disease, bird flu and Ebola? These things always fizzled out. Even when the Italians were warning us that we were two weeks away from a crisis, people said \"Ah, but that's the Italians. They're very tactile. It won't spread as quickly over here.\" As the number of UK cases began to rise, I was still busily planning a weekend break in Luxembourg, while Boris Johnson was busy enjoying a two-week holiday with his girlfriend. Crisis? What crisis?In hindsight, perhaps we were dutifully following Elizabeth Kübler-Ross's model for the five stages of grief, the first of which is denial. We told ourselves that the number of people with Covid-19 was only 12...37...93...168...279..., but by early March, creeping doubts were beginning to set in. Perhaps we were heading for a scenario that was more like this:Within just a few weeks, denial quickly became replaced by anger and fear. How did we sleepwalk into this position? Who was to blame? Should we let the virus sweep through society until herd immunity was achieved, or should we batten down the hatches and risk destroying the economy? After some Olympic-level dithering by Boris Johnson, the hatches were battened down. All non-essential travel was banned and a silence seemed to descend on the world. The normally thriving streets of Lewes became eerily deserted. My son's CBT sessions for his agoraphobia were cancelled. After two weeks of being reassured that the outside world was a safe place, he was now being told that actually it wasn't and that it would probably be better if he stayed indoors. He willingly complied. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. The first lockdown coincided with some unseasonably warm weather and many people enjoyed this unexpected holiday. The distant roar of traffic was suddenly replaced by birdsong and, in the field behind our house, children started to build makeshift dens and swings. It seemed like a glimpse of a more benign world. However, things were starting to turn ugly at the supermarkets, as a mass hysteria developed over a potential shortage of toilet paper. In some city-centre stores, fights were breaking out over the right to have a clean bottom and, while I saluted the protagonists' commitment to personal hygiene, it seemed a baffling thing to come to blows over. The toilet-paper crisis was swiftly alleviated by the beginning of food shortages, which meant that fewer trips to the loo would be required. Gripped by a fear that society was on the brink of collapse, people started buying up all the dried pasta and rice they could find. On a trip to Tesco, the whole meat aisle was empty, apart from two packets of Heck pork sausages. We were quickly reassured that there was no shortage of food; we were just trying to all buy it at the same time, which made it very hard for the supermarkets to replenish their shelves quickly enough. At this point, Tesco swiftly instigated their National Emergency Plan: Unlike the UK government, Tesco had prepared for this eventuality and, thanks to socially distanced queuing and a limit on the number of customers allowed in the store, the food shortages swiftly ended. I sometimes wonder if the Government should have resigned and handed over the reins of power to Tesco, who seemed to possess a sense of direction that Boris Johnson lacked. On the home front, I instigated what was, in hindsight, an absurd \"dig for victory\" campaign in our garden, turning part of the lawn into a potato patch and planting grow bags full of tomatoes. The end result is that, several months later, we had more cherry tomatoes than we knew what to do with and enough potatoes to delay death from starvation by a mere three days. But while my attempts at self-sufficiency might have been laughable, the local area came into its own. Many local farmers and market traders set up veg-box delivery services and every week we enjoyed a selection of fresh vegetables and fruit, all of which were apparently grown locally. It was a revelation; I had no idea that we grew avocados in Sussex.Our veg-box deliveries quickly became the highlight of the week; partly because we hadn't spoken to another human being for days (I don't count the awfulness of a Zoom session as human contact).Another thing that impressed me about the local area was the community spirit that quickly grew. A campaign by the Royal Voluntary Service to recruit people to help the NHS received around a million responses, while, on a more local level, neighbours began to shop for each other and provide lifts for medical appointments. Encouraged by this growing neighbourliness, my wife and I volunteered to do a weekly shop for the elderly couple next door. They were both as deaf as a post, so it seemed like a good idea when the husband suggested sending their shopping lists to my wife by email. It all worked very well at first. Every week, my wife would received a shopping list that seemed particularly focused on prunes and bran (but never loo paper, strangely), which we would then print off and take to Tesco. But then, other emails started to appear and their tone began to acquire a more disturbing nature. At first, it was simple innuendoes, which we put down to the attitudes of a different generation. But then the content started to become more explicit. I'm not quite sure why a man born in 1935 felt compelled to share his sexual history with my wife. He seemed to imagine that he and my wife had a special connection and would send creepy emails with lines like, \"I noticed that you were up very late last night\". As the saying goes, there's no fool like an old fool.Thankfully, the rest of the people in our road were better behaved. Nobody subjected us to any impromptu live gigs or salsa-dancing sessions and the slightly Orwellian hand-clapping sessions never quite took off. There was a vague attempt to have a VE Day street party, but I felt under no compulsion to join in.Life went on. At first, many of us were so terrified of ending up on a ventilator, we regarded a panting jogger or cyclist with the same horror as someone wearing a suicide vest, while a random cough in a supermarket saw people fleeing in all directions. Fortunately, the fear gradually subsided and as the death rate began to fall, some restrictions were lifted.The 'new normal' was like the old normal, but with masks, handwashing and a Cromwellian ban on public fun. I welcomed the introduction of table service in pubs and the ban on social kissing and hugging was an added bonus, but overall it was a strange, melancholy time. To complicate things further, my older son had his first epileptic fit and had to be rushed to hospital. He had been found by his younger brother and, for weeks afterwards, every strange knock or bang would send our younger son rushing upstairs to see if everything was all right.The one highlight of that lost summer was a trip to North Yorkshire, where an old friend gave me a guided tour of the local moors. It was exhilarating to be somewhere different. Indeed, I felt the same level of excitement that I usually reserved for exotic, foreign holidays. But on the way back, reality crept back in. Kings Lynn was a ghost town and I spent a rather lonely evening eating a very indifferent meal, alfresco, in a deserted market square. Where had all the people gone? On the other hand, perhaps this was normal for a town next to the Fens. Did they all come out at night?I had thought that a visit to the quaint coastal village of Blakeney might provide some semblance of normality, but even here, it was impossible to escape from the bogeyman. Wandering around the deserted streets, I felt as if I was in an episode of Doctor Who.But the worst was yet to come. Having a lockdown in the spring was one thing, but shutting the country down for three months during a relentlessly grey, wet winter was another. People who had never suffered from mental-health problems now found themselves experiencing depression for the first time in their lives. I stayed at home, watched television and put on a stone, courtesy of Mr Kipling. Fortunately, there was light at the end of the tunnel and, after a succession of balls-ups, the British government finally got something right with its vaccine programme. My son's epilepsy diagnosis pushed him to the front of the queue and he received his first Pfizer jab.As his carer, I was also bumped up the queue and a few weeks later, I received my first AstraZeneca vaccine. On both occasions, I was really impressed by the efficiency of the whole process and the dedication and patience shown by the staff, particularly the volunteer vaccine stewards. Indeed, I felt so grateful, I ended up becoming a vaccine steward myself. Being a vaccine steward was exhausting. In Brighton, I was on my feet for six hours, with just one 15-minute break. The work was monotonous but vital, as it meant that the NHS staff were able to get on with their jobs rather than wasting time directing people. According to my phone, in an area that was a mere 25ft long, I walked over 8000 steps. After the miserable winter lockdown ended, I took a train to London and discovered that it was still closed. I suppose the empty train and PPE vending machine at Lewes Station should have given me a clue. But the idea of a deserted city seemed the stuff of science-fiction films, where the silence was only broken by marauding triffids or gangs of looters. In Trafalgar Square, three police vans were parked on the perimeter and I realised that I was under observation, which was a little disconcerting. Since then, life has gradually returned to normal. Relaxing the rules resulted in a spike of new Covid cases, but that now seems to be in reverse and the number of people wearing masks in crowded places is slowly declining. Friends have started kissing again, so we're now back to the nightmare of trying to remember if so-and-so is a one- or two-cheek-kissing person. Overall, I wouldn't say that Covid-19 has had a huge impact on my life. The people who have suffered have been the young, those who haven't been able to see loved ones and, of course, those who caught the virus. I was already leading a life of self-isolation looking after my sons, so the lockdown didn't change things much for me.   However, I did learn one important lesson: make hay while the sun shines. Spend more time with friends and loved ones, visit the places you've always wanted to see and don't spend all your days at home eating Mr Kipling's Almond Slices. I hope that there won't be another long year like this in my lifetime, but this is, after all, an age of uncertainty."},
{"title": "Since Then", "date": "Tuesday, January 08, 2019", "text": "For part of the 1970s, London-based viewers of the TV soap 'Crossroads' were six months behind the rest of the country. I can't remember why, but I do recall that part of the excitement of going on holiday was being able to watch an up to date episode. It was like travelling into the future.As with all good time travel stories, I was shocked by some of the things I saw. Why was Sandy in a wheelchair? What had turned Amy Turtle into a common thief? Where was Ted Hope? How could so much happen in six months?In the end, Thames Television decided to catch up with the rest of the UK and a special update was filmed, with motel owner Meg Mortimer explaining what had taken place in King's Oak. As it's been a long time since I've written a blog post, I thought I'd emulate Thames and provide a brief update of what's happened here.1. I Have a New HomeWhen my mother died, I'd hoped that we'd finally have the opportunity to swap our terraced Victorian broom cupboard for a decent-sized house in Lewes, where I could hide from people and everyone would have the space to potter around. By decent, I mean normal; a three-bed semi with a garage and a garden longer than 20 feet. Sadly, I soon realised that my small inheritance wouldn't even cover this modest ambition, as the prices for non-terraced houses suddenly shot up. Disheartened, I began to think the unthinkable: leave Lewes.Long story short: we now live just outside Lewes, in a detached house with a view of the South Downs. Thanks to postcode snobbery, it was almost exactly the same price as our old house. I love it.2. I Am No Longer Gainfully EmployedIn a normal family, my older son would probably be at university by now or in full-time employment, while his younger brother would be going to the local school and hanging out with friends. None of this has happened. Instead, I have gradually become a full-time carer to both boys, home educating the younger one.There are two types of people who home educate their children: those who want to and those who have to. I am firmly in the latter camp and would far rather be working. For all its frustrations, work brings camaraderie, a sense of purpose and, of course, money. At the moment, my time is spent almost entirely at home, as neither boy likes going out. After six months of this, I started to go a bit stir crazy, so my wife very kindly suggested that I went off on a little jaunt somewhere. This turned out to be a very good idea and I am now making full use of EasyJet's cheap flights. Visiting a city like Berlin certainly clears away the cobwebs and stops me feeling that my life is in a complete rut.As for the home education, although I may be a reluctant teacher, I am trying my best to ensure that my son has a thorough grounding in the basics, but is also free to follow his enthusiasms and passions. Sometimes we'll read a book together, but at others we might watch a film or YouTube clip and discuss it. So far, my son seems to be enjoying his lessons and is much happier than he was this time last year, so I'm quietly hopeful.3. Reading HelpsIt can be hard to maintain a positive outlook when you see your loved ones struggling. I feel haunted by the ghost of the carefree childhood that my older son never had. I have been assured by professionals that we did all the right things, but it is hard not to experience a residual feeling of failure. We do not bring children into the world to suffer. On gloomy, winter days, I wonder if this is it. Will I work again? Will my sons ever find their way in life and if not, what will happen when we are old? Will I even make it to old age if I live a life where I rarely get any exercise, because my son won't go out but doesn't like being left alone?Of course it's ridiculous to think along these lines and when I worked, I was far too busy. But during the afternoons, when the lessons are finished and lunches eaten, my quiet time can be a mixed blessing, so thank God for the novel. What greater pleasure can there be than getting stuck into a novel like Buddenbrooks, spending hour upon hour in 19th century Lübeck?Blogging also used to be cathartic, but without the stimulus of work and travel, I've been rather short of material. I haven't wanted to share my recent experiences because I didn't think it wouldn't be terribly entertaining, but I'm not quite ready to join the increasing number of people who have given up blogging. I will try to ensure that my next post is more amusing."},
{"title": "A Year in Books", "date": "Thursday, October 04, 2018", "text": "This post originally appeared on my other, now defunct blog, in December 2016.At the end of last year, my wife and I swapped roles. It was an easy decision, as I was the only one of us able to drive our sons to their new schools. My wife joined a publishing company and thrived, while I joined the world of stay-at-home fathers, and withered.However, although this has been a challenging year, I've been grateful for the opportunity to read more books than ever.I began the year by resolving to abandon my Kindle and enjoyed some serendipitous discoveries in charity shops. However, almost a year on, my teetering piles of books have reminded me why I bought a Kindle in the first place.Here are a few of the titles that made a particular impression on me:  1. SURPRISINGLY TOPICAL READ OF THE YEARPhilip Roth's novel 'The Plot Against America', published 12 years ago, takes place in an alternate timeline in which Roosevelt lost the 1940 Presidential election to Charles Lindbergh. At the time, a story about an experienced politician losing to a celebrity with fascist sympathies and no experience of government seemed rather far fetched.Of course, Hillary Clinton is no Roosevelt and Donald Trump is no Lindbergh, but the essential message of this book is worth heeding: democracy can become quickly debased if we allow it.   2. BETTER THAN EXPECTED READ OF THE YEARI'd always assumed that Norman Collins' novel 'London Belongs to Me' was a dreadful old potboiler, so it was a pleasant surprise to find that for all its faults, it was a compelling and vivid evocation of London on the eve of the Second World War. Set in a boarding house that has seen better days, the novel eavesdrops on the lives of its occupants with insight and humour. The perfect comfort read, 'London Belongs To Me' has been reissued as a Penguin Modern Classic, with a glowing recommendation on the cover from Sarah Walters.3. RANDOM CHARITY SHOP DISCOVERY OF THE YEARThe name VS Prichett meant little to me apart from his occasional appearance in short story collections, so I was intrigued to find a novel by him in the Lewes branch of Oxfam. Largely set in the Amazon jungle, 'Dead Man Leading' reads like a Conradian tale as written by Evelyn Waugh, with a finely-tuned sense of the absurd. But although it is faintly reminiscent of the last part of Waugh's own 'A Handful of Dust', Pritchett has a clear, confident voice and the result is a book that is odd and unsettling, but strangely compelling. 4. DYSTOPIAN NOVEL OF THE YEAR'The Life & Times of Michael K' by JM Coetzee was published in 1983, winning the author his first Booker Prize. There is an awful lot of dystopian and post-apocalyptic genre fiction being published at the moment and some of it is very enjoyable, but Coetzee's brilliantly stark vision has yet to be matched.5. BEST NEW THRILLERI enjoy a good thriller and with a Kindle I can read any old trash without anyone knowing, but I've no patience with books that suffer from lumpen prose, implausible characters and cliche-ridden dialogue, no matter how good the plot is.Fortunately, Sabine Durrant's 'Lie With Me' is a cut above the average thriller and a worthy successor to Patricia Highsmith, intelligently written and well plotted. I thought it was much better than the overrated 'The Girl on the Train'.Durrant does a very convincing job of narrating the story from the perspective of a man in his early 40s and her depiction of an affluent South London family rings horribly true. I also enjoyed her evocative descriptions of a Greek island, written in a clear prose style that avoids the overwritten cliches of many genre novels.6. NON FICTION BOOK OF THE YEARThe subject of John Preston's 'A Very English Scandal' will mean little to anyone under the age of 45 and absolutely nothing to anyone outside the UK, but it is a story that will appeal to many. Jeremy Thorpe was the charismatic leader of Britain's Liberal Party, with a lust for power that was only exceeded by his penchant for young men. When the latter threatened the former, in the guise of a troubled individual called Norman Scott, Thorpe asked a friend to have him killed.Beyond some smutty 1970s playground jokes (\"What do Jeremy Thorpe and Captain Kirk have in common?), my only memory of Thorpe was a sympathetic one - a good man defeated by the bigotry of a different age.How wrong I was. The Thorpe that emerges in these pages is a charming psychopath, callously exploiting the extraordinary loyalty of his friends and family to further his political career.'A Very English Scandal' reads like a thriller and is utterly gripping from start to finish.7. OBSCURE CLASSIC OF THE YEAR'The Serious Game' is an extraordinary 1912 novel by Hjalmar Söderberg, who in his native Sweden is regarded as the equal of Strindberg. On the face of it it's a simple enough tale of a young couple who fall in love, but end up being unhappily married to other people. What's remarkable about the book is its modernity and insight, containing a candour that no English novelist would have dared to attempt in Edwardian Britain.8. FORGOTTEN MASTERPIECE OF THE YEAR'The Deadly Percheron' by John Franklin Bardin is one of those rare novels that transcends its genre. What begins as a rather eccentric mystery novel set in New York quickly changes gear, taking the reader on a strange journey into the darker recesses of the human pyche, where nothing is what it seems. Written in 1946, this novel has been largely forgotten since it was republished by Penguin during the 1960s, but has enjoyed a cult following.9. MOST HARROWING READ OF THE YEAR'Chernobyl Prayer' by Svetlana Alexievich is a brilliant piece of reportage, collecting eye-witness accounts of people affected by the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.One of the most shocking stories relates how some robotic devices - sent in to move irradiated graphite rods - kept breaking down after a bried period of exposure to radiation. In the end, men were dispatctched to pick the rods up by hand, wearing only the flimsiest of protective suits. Told that they couldn't have more than 40 seconds' exposure to the graphite, the men soon discovered that it was impossible to do anything in under two minutes and went ahead regardless.For me, the most harrowing part of the book was reading a wife's account of how she nursed her husband during a long, debilitating and painful illness, following his exposure to a massive dose of radiation. When he finally died, his body treated as radioactive waste, buried in a lead-lined coffin.But if this all sounds too upsetting, I should also add that 'Chernobyl Prayer' also contains some remarkable stories of heroism, compassion and survival. It is a gripping read that reveals the best and worst of humanity.10. SILLIEST BOOK OF THE YEARI really enjoyed Dorothy Hughes's 1940s noir thriller 'In a Lonely Place' and was keen to explore her backlist. Sadly, 'The So Blue Marble' is one of the most ridiculous books I've ever read, with an implausible plot and a selection of unbelievable characters.Thinking that Hughes must have had an off day, I tried another novel by her and was equally nonplussed.11. LIGHTEST HEAVY BOOK OF THE YEARAdam Roberts' 'The Thing Itself' is a high concept novel that bandies ideas about Kantian philosophy, quantum physics and artificial intelliegence around with the ease of someone talking about the weather. A description of the plot would be no help at all. All I can say is that it's a playful, witty, knockabout tale that wears its cleverness lightly and is consistently funny.12. BEST NOVEL BY A BALD, SOUTH AFRICAN EMIGREI'm a big fan of Justin Cartwright and really enjoyed reading his 2002 novel 'White Lightning'. With a narrative that alternates between South Africa and England, this is a poignant tale of grief and loneliness that is redeemed by the author's wit and humanity. I was particularly amused by Cartwright's description of a 'saucy film' shoot, only to later discover that in the 1970s, he wrote the screenplay for 'Rosie Dixon - Night Nurse'.These were the books that made a big impression on me, but I should mention that I also really enjoyed Kate Summerscale's 'The Suspicions of Mr Whicher', Trollope's 'Doctor Throne', Jonathan Franzen's new novel 'Purity', Andrew Hurley's superb 'The Loney', Lionel Shriver's latest book 'The Mandibles' and Derek Raymond's grim but brilliant 'Factory' novels.I also read three books by Dutch people.Next year I intend to not read any DH Lawrence or Commonwealth novels with lengthy descriptions of marketplaces, fruit and wise old men, but other than that, I am open to almost anything."},
{"title": "Present Imperfect", "date": "Wednesday, October 03, 2018", "text": "Many thanks to the people who have posted kind comments about the last post. I wasn't expecting anyone to notice my stealthy return to this blog, so I'm touched by the response.Two years ago I decided to finish this blog and try something new on Wordpress, as I thought that it would enable me to create something more impressive. I went through the process of signing up, buying a domain name and even read a guide to Wordpress. However, I was like one of those people who think that buying a pencil and a sketch pad will make them an artist. I managed a year with the new blog - 'Present Imperfect'. I hadn't quite turned it into the multimedia spectacular that I'd envisaged and my disappointment gradually turned into total inertia. However, I was stirred into action a couple of days ago, as my domain name expired and the company that hosted the new blog shut it down. I won't bore you with the finer details, except to say that restoring Present Imperfect would be a complicated process and, more importantly, cost me £75 - money that I'd rather spend on a kite or a hunting horn. I thought that the posts on the new blog had disappeared into the ether, but the html is still on Wordpress, so I'm gradually moving the material over here. In between transferring posts (which involves a tedious resizing of images), I will try to add something new.I return to Blogger like an errant husband, after an affair with a younger woman. I thought that Wordpress would inject a new potency into my blogging, but instead I discovered that I didn't have the energy to keep up with its demands. While I dallied away, Blogger patiently waited for me to come home, older and wiser."},
{"title": "Am Dram", "date": "Monday, October 01, 2018", "text": "I recently found a batch of photographs from the 1950s, all of which feature theatrical performances. There's very little information on the backs, but I'm almost certain that they show the work of an amateur dramatics group rather than a professional one.The clues are as follows:The photos were processed in the dreary London suburbs of Cheam and New MaldenThere's quite a lot of over overactingThe pictures look like the work of an enthusiastic amateur; many were very blurryBut I may be wrong. You decide: This photo was printed by Cole Studios (which is still going) in New Malden - a rather drab place between Kingston-upon-Thames and Raynes Park. It now has a large Korean community, for no discernible reason (unless it reminds them of North Korea).The set looks quite spartan, but that isn't the case in the next picture:This is clearly a very emotional point in the play and everyone seems to be weeping. Perhaps this is in response to an earlier scene, in which things get rather heated:This is a little bit racy for 1950s am-dram. I don't know what play it is, but it clearly isn't 'Charlie's Aunt'. I think it was very brave of Miss Perkins in Accounts to agree to strip down to her underwear, but perhaps it was even more courageous of Brenda to wear those awful pyjamas. In the end, everything is resolved amicably. It turns out that Miss Perkins was simply modelling for an artist and the murder weapon was a telephone directory for New Malden and Cheam. Brenda is the murdereress and she switched to the terrible pyjamas because her dress had blood on it.It is commendable that this company were prepared to tackle gritty dramas rather than just stick to the old favourites:Here we see a 'kitchen sink' drama, as evidenced by a kitchen sink and a packet of Fairy Snow. I presume that this is a challenging drama about race, as one of the cast appears to have 'blacked-up'. I also see that the woman is wearing hair rollers to indicate that she is working class.This is from 'Twelfth Night'. Today we would probably say that this was part of an 'outreach programme' that sought to 'create links with the local community' or even 'communities'. In the 1950s, they just did an open air performance and hoped that it didn't rain.This is from a production of 'Call Me Madam'. I find the rictus grin of the man in the middle slightly offputting.I have no idea what this play is, but I don't think it's 'The Importance of Being Earnest'.However, this is:In this production, the weeping middle-aged man at the piano has been transformed into a sprightly young buck. I wonder if a stripey blazer would do the same for me?I'm struck by how much hard work must have gone into the stage set and the costumes. I never used to notice these things until I met my wife's family, who worked in the theatrical world. Her father was the lighting designer for the London Coliseum, but although he was highly regarded by his peers, his work was rarely mentioned in reviews.Since then, I've always taken more interest in the details.Once again, I have no idea what this is. I can only tell you that it isn't 'Look Back in Anger'.And now, the show is over and it's time to take a curtain call:"},
{"title": "Thank you", "date": "Friday, October 14, 2016", "text": "Thank you to everyone who posted such kind comments in response to my last post. I would have liked to respond to each individual comment, but I'm not firing on all cylinders at the moment.The cremation took place this morning and went as well as I could have hoped. Everybody seemed to think that my mother would have been pleased with it. We read one of her poems, I read a tribute and during the time of quiet reflection, we listened to Abide With Me. There was also a second poem by a Mr Anon, which was so apposite I wondered if anyone would guess the author's identity. At the end, I handed out roses to each person and they placed them by the coffin. Afterwards, someone came up to me and asked me where I'd managed to find such beautiful flowers. I didn't tell them that I'd spent £6 in Tesco the previous day.The next post I write will be to give the name and web address of my new blog. I will finish with a picture of my mother behind the till at Woolworths in Teddington, for Chris, who wondered if he'd seen her there. She worked there every weekday morning until 1990. My father thought that she should do something better, but the hours fittted around the school holidays and she wasn't too proud to work there.Next week, I will begin the long, slow process of dismantling a life, forensically going through every item in her flat: the reading glasses, tablets, walking stick, Werther's Originals, romance novels, Damart catalogues, old birthday cards from her family, certificates, framed cross stitch pictures, biscuits and unopened sets of notelets. It will feel wrong, as if she is going to come back and ask me what I have done."},
{"title": "Never Say Never", "date": "Wednesday, October 05, 2016", "text": "I had thought that The Last Post was the last post; on this blog at least. I'd set up a new blog on Wordpress and planned to make it more 'multimedia', beginning with a podcast featuring my mother and her friends talking about the day war broke out.I wanted to record their stories before it was too late. Sadly, it already was too late. My mother had a major heart attack ten days ago, but didn't realise what had happened and simply thought that she was unwell. By the time she was admitted to hospital, four days later, the damage to her heart was irreversible.She didn't know that she was dying. During my last visit, only ten hours before her death, my mother asked me to bring a comb with me when I returned, as she was concerned that her perm was in a mess. I made a note to buy one the next day.The hospital phoned several times during the night, but I was sound asleep and heard nothing. When I finally answered, a doctor told me to get there as soon as I could. I raced across the South Downs in the dark, jumping the traffic lights when there were no other cars. I arrived just in time. My mother was asleep, with an oxygen mask over her face. The doctor didn't beat around the bush: \"I'm afraid your mother is dying. I don't think it will be long. We've done everything we can to make her comfortable.\" The nurse stroked my arm and the doctor asked if we had any religious requirements. I shook my head.The oxygen mask steamed up every time my mother exhaled. I noticed that her left eyelid was half open, but I had been assured that she wasn't conscious. I wondered how things could have changed so much over a few hours. I took my phone out and sent a text to my wife to let her know what was happening. After pressing send, I looked up and noticed that the oxygen mask was clear. The nurse took my mother's wrist: \"She's gone.\" A heart that had been beating continuously since 1929 had stopped.It was a shock, but also a relief. My mother had died a peaceful, dignified death, blissfully unaware of what was happening to her. If she'd lived, she would have had a pretty awful existence, needing help with even the most basic tasks. She had always dreaded ending up in a home or 'going potty' and selfishly, I dreaded it too.  In spite of decreasing mobility, my mother had led a pretty active life right up until the end. She spent her last two weeks hobbling around the streets of Lewes, determined to get one of the new plastic five pound notes. I don't know why she was so excited by them, but it became something of an obsession.  Sadly, she didn't find one.I felt that I had to write this post, as I have written about my mother so many times and didn't want to leave out the end of the story.I have just started to receive cards through the post. Whenever I see the phrase \"passed on\", I silently cringe, partly because my mother hated it so much: \"They haven't passed on; they've died,\" she would always say. I'm not sure why it made her so angry, but perhaps growing up surrounded by death, during the London Blitz, gave her a contempt for the coyness of the modern age. People are being very nice to me, saying how shocked I must feel, but my overwhelming emotion is one of gratitude that my mother lived as long and as well as she did. I've witnessed some pretty horrible deaths over the years and it was a huge relief to see my mother die peacefully. At some point, I hope I'll be able to write something about my mother's life, but for the moment this is as much as I can do. I will post a link to the new blog when it's ready."},
{"title": "The Last Post", "date": "Thursday, August 11, 2016", "text": "This blog is ten yearsold today and I have decided that this will be my last post, as Ifeel that the content has become increasingly repetitive. It wasrelatively easy to write when I had a job that exposed me to a wealthof amusing books, photos and diaries, but my present role as a'carer' doesn't provide the same inspiration and posts take twice aslong to write. Some people havesuggested that I write about my current experiences, but I feel thatthis would intrude on my sons' privacy. My older son has very strongopinions on the subject and every time I mention him in a blog post,I experience a slight pang of betrayal. It would be better to juststop. I also feel that I need to focus on what I am going todo when, in a year's time, I'm able to return to work. I have almosta third of my working life ahead of me and have absolutely no ideawhat to do with it. I could revive my book business, but with so manysuppliers going out of business, getting stock has become a realstruggle. I’m planning to take a break for a while, afterwhich I will either set up a new blog or try and build a website. Ifthat happens, I'll post a link here. Unlike a well-known bookblogger, I will not be initiating the auto-destruct sequence and thecontent here will simply gather dust in the attic of cyberspace andthe archives of the British Library.The blog began as asimple experiment, while I was laid up in bed after eating some badoysters. I wrote a rather fatuous post and pressed publish, notexpecting anyone to read it. However, within a day I received aninteresting comment from someone called Ms Baroque and realised thata blog post wasn't a monologue, but the beginning of a conversation.I would like to thank everyone who has taken the time to readthese posts over the years. I still can't quite understand why anyonewould want to follow this blog, but I'm deeply grateful to those whodo. I would also like to thank those who have commented fortheir kindness, thoughtfulness and wisdom. Thanks to fellow bloggers,I have discovered some wonderful books, learned about subjects I knewnothing about and visited exhibitions that I might otherwise havemissed. In addition to communicating across the ether, I havealso met a few bloggers, all of whom were as interesting and likeableas their writing. I would like to apologise to anyone who hasbeen offended by what I have written in some of my posts. There hasnever been any intent to cause upset, but my attempts to amuse mayhave occasionally hit a wrong note, either through naivety orthoughtlessness on my part.  I will continue to post onTwitter and Instagram (as phil._.b), so I hope to maintain contact with some of thepeople who have been good enough to follow this blog.Onceagain, many thanks for reading."},
{"title": "To the North", "date": "Wednesday, July 27, 2016", "text": "By modern day standards I'm not particularly well travelled, but I have seen a little of the world and visited some unusual places. However, I've been pretty useless at exploring my own country. I wasn't fully aware of this until a couple of months ago, when I worked out that I had spent less than two weeks of my adult life on the northern side of the Watford Gap.It came as a shock to realise that I'd spent more time in Chile, Spain or France than the upper two thirds of Great Britain, so I resolved to do something about it. I'd wanted to explore the north for quite a few years, but my older son couldn't cope with any car journey over three hours and after a disastrous trip to Spain, we decided to give up on family holidays.  However, my son has made so much progress during the last year, we felt that it was worth trying again, so I got out a map and worked out how far we could travel over ten days.I checked distances on Google Maps and came up with the following intinerary: Lewes-Knaresborough-Whitby-Alnwick-Lindisfarne-Edinburgh-Inverness-Fort William-Glasgow-Lake Windemere-Yorkshire Dales-Haworth-Lewes. It would be a whistlestop tour of northern England and Scotland.After confirming that our trip would include visits to Scottish relatives and a detour to the Lake District, my wife gave her royal ascent and I booked family rooms in a succession of hotels and b&bs. Then, two weeks ago, we got in the car and looked for a road sign that pointed to 'The North'.For many years, I assumed that the North began somewhere slightly beyond Northampton, where people began to rhyme 'luck' with 'push' and many placenames ended in 'by' or 'thwaite'. There would be drystone walls instead of hedgerows and wild, windswept moorlands. But I was wrong. Before the North there is a place called the Midlands and everything looks quite similar for a long time. I also noticed that even when I reached Yorkshire, it didn't look particularly northern until I'd driven right up to the edge of the North Yorkshire Moors, at which point the landscape dramtically changed and became more interesting.But rather than bore you with a blow by blow account, here is a brief summary of the highs and lows of the trip:HIGHSThe landscape of the Scottish Highlands. The accents, all of which were music to my ears compared to our local one.Knaresborough - one of the most beautiful towns I've visited, anywhere.North Yorkshire, which fulfilled my dreams of wild and windy moors.Whitby - a beautiful fishing town with the best fish and chips in Britain.The B&Bs we stayed at - a far cry from their grim predecessors.The museums and galleries of Edinburgh - all within walking distance, unlike London.Visiting my wife's Scottish relatives.LOWSThe awful chain hotels we stayed at - soulless and expensive, with suprisingly bad food.Glasgow - I enoyed exploring the city, but my sons hated it and refused to leave the hotel. 11 days of UHT milk pods - you can't make a decent cup of tea with it. The eternal struggle of finding somewhere to park.Holy Island - It had always looked impressive from a distance. Up close, it has bungalows. The cost of even the most basic evening meal.The drive home, which went on and on and on.Here are some photos: Knaresborough was beautiful and civilised. I would like to go back for longer and also explore nearby Harrowgate.I was also a big fan of Whitby, which is a very picturesque fishing port, but also a traditional working class holiday resort, which saves it from being too twee. I particularly liked the famed Yorkshire 'plain speaking' as displayed by a rather taciturn waiter who simply looked at our plates and said \"All done?\"My wife took a while to adjust: \"They don't seem to have a wine list. Is that a northern thing?\" I'd wanted to visited Whitby ever since I'd watched a BBC Play for Today called The Fishing Party. The ruined Whitby Abbey is the town's main attraction and the connection with Dracula draws many people with dyed black hair and unfortunate tattoos. I also noticed a lot of older men with shaved heads and large, slightly menacing dogs. I don't normally long for bad weather, but I felt that the Abbey had lost some of its mystery in the bright sunshine, so in the evening I climbed the famous 199 steps and took some more atmopsheric shots, like this one:This is the Falling Foss - one of the many beautiful rivers and falls in North Yorkshire. My sons loved clambering over the rocks. Edinburgh was a big hit with everyone. We booked an apartment just off the Royal Mile, which I can warmly recommend if you like non-stop bagpipe playing. Sometimes two pipers were playing different pieces at the same time, like a Charles Ives composition.An octogenrian relative offered to drive us around the city and out of politeness we assented, but it turned out to be one of the most terrifying experiences I've ever had, like a very slow but deadly James Bond car chase. This photo above is of a very attractive Edinburgh cafe that serves haggis sausages.What better way to start a visit to the Highlands than a cruise on Loch Ness? Sadly, we were acommpanied by several dozen Chinese tourists, all armed with selfie sticks, who seemed rather over-excited and kept shouting over the commentary on the boat. At first I thought it was a one-off, but we witnessed the same behaviour on several occasions and our b&b owner confirmed that this was a common phenomenon.I remember a time when, along with the Japanese and the Scandinavians, the Chinese were the most well-behaved and self-effacing of travellers. What has happened?I'd always assumed that Inverness was a small, charming Highland town and part of it still is, but it is also now one of Europe's fastest-growing cities, with Sim City-like industrial zones and suburbs. It also has a very large secondhand bookshop called Leakey's, which is well worth a visit.After what my wife's great-uncle described as a 'dreich' day, we were rewarded with some glorious weather when we drove to the west coast. I noticed that nearly half of the cars on the road were from the Netherlands. I've no idea why, but perhaps they were seeking relief from the relentless flatness of their own country.Plockton is one of the most beautiful places on the west coast - a small fishing village that, due to some geographical quirk, faces east. Its location in a protected bay and the Gulf Stream give it a surprisingly mild climate. Palm trees can be found by the harbour. I had been to Plockton once before and met an interesting woman who was a very keen member of the SNP. She very kindly drove me around the Isle of Skye and gave me a map showing a route that took me on a path up into hills above Plockton. When I reached the top, the view was breathtaking. I vowed I would return as soon as I could.That was 13 years ago.Glencoe - a stunning place with a tragic history. I intended to go for a long walk, but when my sons found a stream and started building a dam, I didn't have the heart to stop them:Parents can spend so much money on keeping their children entertained, but the greatest pleasures in life usually cost nothing (fuel, food and accommodation excepted). If we go back, I think I'll look for somewhere where my sons can just mess around in the water, preferably without drowning, Later we stopped by a loch and my sons ruined two pairs of shoes, but had one of the happiest afternoons of their lives. After the grandeur of the Scottish Highlands, Glasgow was an huge disappointment, as far as my sons were concerned. I thought it was it little like London - not beautiful, but full of interesting buildings and hidden gems, so I took a train to Partick and began exploring. I'd like to see more of Glasgow, but I suspect it will be a solo trip.Glasgow's reputation as a tough city is neatly encapsulated in the 'No Spitting' signs in their old subway carriages, which can be seen in the excellent Riverside Museum. The sign wasn't simply an attempt to improve the manners of Glasgow's more uncouth inhabitants, but also a vital measure in the fight against TB, which claimed blighted the lives of many Glaswegians. Although TB no longer ravages the tenements of Glasgow, the city still has many public health problems and I noticed many people who were not only morbidly obese, but also keen smokers. Glasgow is officially the sickest city in the United Kingdom and one in four men don't reach their 65th birthday. After Glasgow, we drove down to the Lake District and hired a boat on Lake Windemere. Like Loch Ness, it was full of Chinese tourists with selfie sticks, but I managed to find a self-drive boat and we escaped from the madding crowd. Apart from a near collision with a paddle steamer, we had a very pleasant time. On the final day, we visited the Bronte Museum in Haworth, which was well worth the additional two hours journey time. On the dining table, where the sisters wrote their novels, there is a small E carved by Emily, who died on the couch in the background. The other rooms are full of interest, containing childhood ephemera, Bramwell's paintings and Charlotte's wedding dress.I was particularly struck by a display of locks of hair - Emily was very blonde - and wondered if it would be possible to recreate the Bronte family using Jurassic Park-style technology.I said I wouldn't bore you with a blow by blow account, but I seem to have done exactly that. To conclude, the holiday was a success and my older son, who once refused to leave the house, seems energised by the experience. Like so many children with his issues, he loved the most remote parts of the Highlands and hated anywhere that was full of tourists.As for me, in the same way that some middle aged men realise that they're gay after years of denial, I have discovered that I am a closet Northerner. I suppose all the signs were there - a fondness for mushy peas, an aversion to direct sunlight and a preference for plain speaking. Perhaps I've been living in the wrong part of England all this time."},
{"title": "The Best of Times", "date": "Thursday, June 30, 2016", "text": "It's exactly ten years since the bookshop company I worked for - Ottakar's  - was taken over HMV Media, who incorporated the shops into its Waterstone's chain. I was happy at Ottakar's. It was a company that valued individuality, not only tolerating the quirky and eccentric, but actively encouraging it. Ottakar's and I were a good fit. The company culture came from its founder and managing director, James Heneage - a man who was the antithesis of the grey-suited businessman. Fiercely intelligent and disarmingly honest, he had an unusual background. Expelled from a famous public school, he went on to join the army at Sandhurst and was allegedly responsible for the only mutiny in his regiment's history, when he got his soldiers lost in a jungle.I suspect that many of the anecdotes about James were apocryphal, but it wouldn't have surprised me if they were true. James was a larger than life character, with a clipped military voice that boomed across the room. During a visit to one shop in early December, James was dismayed to find that there were no Christmas decorations and bellowed at the manager \"What are you? Some sort of Calvinist?!\"But underneath the bluff exterior, there was a great warmth and we all felt that he was on our side. I have met many politicians, actors, writers and artists, but few of them have had the charisma that James Heneage possessed. He was a natural leader. I enjoyed the job because in addition to the mundane business of running a shop, I had the opportunity to hold events, write articles about authors and meet a variety of people at launch parties. Sometimes the encouters were quite surreal: a conversation about NCP car parks with Lee Child, meeting John Grisham in a medieval hall that looked like something out of Hogwarts, dancing with a very drunk Mrs Doyle from Father Ted, meeting a True Crime author who told me that he could kill me with his bare hands if he wasn't a Buddhist, discussing the book trade with Jacqueline Wilson whilst sitting on a merry-go-round, advising Katie Price what she and Peter Andre should read in bed together...it was all very amusing. I also worked with some lovely people - bright, unpretentious, full of fun, mostly. Most of the staff went on to greater things, but a few would have struggled to find employment anywhere else; for example, one member of staff liked watching DVD boxed sets of Apollo landings in real time and also had a collection of music by Nazi swing bands (one dance hit was called 'Bomb England'), but they loved their books and were a real assett to the business. When the company was taken over, the new owners said how much they valued our 'passion' and wanted to incorporate it into the wider business, but within a year my job had turned into a very dull admin role, with all of the important decisions made elsewhere. After 18 unhappy months, I decided to leave Waterstone's before they left me. But rather than dwell on sad endings, here's a small celebration of what I loved about Ottakar's:Partly out of devilment, but also in an attempt to boost sales, I held an event featuring dangerous and exotic animals during the school holidays. In hindsight, it could have ended badly, but luckily it passed without a hitch. This woman has a rather useless chameleon on her arm. Why hasn't it turned blue?In this photo, I'm holding a tarantula, wondering what will happen it it jumps off and runs away.The Science Museum decided that their existing bookshop was too dull and asked Ottakar's to come in and make it more 'visitor friendly'. Less charitable souls might say that we took a good academic bookshop and dumbed it down, but it went down very well with the Museum and I really enjoyed the challenge of setting up a shop in such a unique envionment.I'm not sure if the Museum realised how little we knew about science - we were completely winging it - but I think we got away with it.I was very flattered when James Heneage told me that I was the ideal man for the job, possessing the necessary tact and diplomacy to deal with the museum authorities. Later I discovered that four people had turned the position down before I was offered it.We had to work with the existing fixtures and fittings, all of which were very drab, but managed to come up with something half decent. Unfortunately, the director of the museum didn't like the illuminated sign, as he felt that the phrase 'Adult Books' had unfortunate associations. An Ingmar Bergman moment from a lovely weekend in Sweden, courtesy of one of my ex-booksellers from the Clapham branch, who let us use her flat in Stockholm. As much as I love books, it's the people that I valued most about the job.In the Crawley branch, we held the longest ever Jacqueline Wilson signing event, which lasted for eight hours. This photo doesn't do justice to the length of the queue.Even the most jaded, world weary bookseller would be hard pressed not to be moved by an event like this. Jacqueline Wilson was wonderful and made every child feel as if they had a special bond with her. It was quite terrifying when it started, as I had no idea that so many people would turn up. When some very 'assertive' mothers started to surge forward, I had to act quickly to avoid a punch-up. In Ottakar's the ethos was that quirky, interesting shops were good for business. Staff were encouraged to think of innovative ways to display and promote books, which made the job far more interesting for them. Every shop I worked in had at least one talented artist who produced the most astonishing windows.In 2005, I had to open a shop in Worthing at the same time that my father was dying. It was a challenging time, but in many ways it helped having something to focus on. It was the first time I'd had the opportunity to recruit a team of staff from scratch, so I decided to follow my gut instinct and pick people I'd be happy to go to the pub with. The result was one of the happiest places I've worked in.The set-up week involved converting a bare shell of a unit into a fully stocked shop with 25,000 books within five days. Every day we worked for up to 12 hours, then went out drinking. No matter lively the evening was, everyone was back the following morning at 8.00 sharp, which was quite remarkable in some cases.The takeover of Ottakar's wasn't a certainty. The bid had been referred to the Monopolies Commission and we spent the best part of a year wondering what our fate was going to be. But on a Monday morning at the beginning of July, I turned on my PC and saw an email that read 'Welcome to Waterstone's'.My heart sank.If I ever come into a small fortune, I will revive a branch of Ottakar's just for the fun of it. I suppose the name is copyrighted, so keep an eye out for a bookshop called Ottokers, O.T.Takars or Otto Kerr's."},
{"title": "Life After Britain", "date": "Saturday, June 25, 2016", "text": "The night before the EU referendum, the clouds prophetically darkened and a terrible storm broke over Lewes. My wife, who had been helping at a book launch in London, sent a text asking me to pick her up from Haywards Heath. As I drove through the blinding rain, trying to work out where the road was, I thought about the following day's referendum and confidently concluded that the Leave campaign had lost its momentum. At the final moment, people would step back from the edge and take comfort in the fact that at least they had made their feelings clear. But I was wrong.It feels as if someone has lit a fuse. This isn't just the end of Great Britain in Europe, but of Great Britain itself. In a few years' time, the famous Union Jack will be redundant and if there is still a United Kingdom, it will probably just consist of England and Wales.People around the world are rightly asking why a successful, prosperous country has pressed the self-destruct button. In Britain, many of the 48% who voted for Remain are in a state of shock and anger.Looking at the post-referendum statistics, it is clear that the country is split down the middle and that, rather than simply being a conflict between left and right, the divide is between old and young, rural and urban, graduates and non-graduates and, most destructively, Scotland and Northern Ireland versus England and Wales. Never has the ancient Chinese curse, 'May you live in interesting times', been more apposite. I rarely write about politics, but as so many people are offering their two penn'orth, here are mine. It will be nothing new to British readers, but might be of mild interest to people elsewhere.I think that the referendum result was largely about immigration and the pace of change that has taken place during the last decade or so. There has been a steady Commonwealth immigration to the UK since the Empire Windrush first arrived in 1948, but it was largely limited to the cities and those towns that had an industrial base, like Bradford, Luton and Oldham. As recently as the 1980s, vast swathes of Britain were barely touched by immigration. There was an unofficial apartheid between two alternate visions of Britain: one a multiracial, multicultural, metropolitan society; the other, a more traditional, homogeneous one. Overall, society was changing, but at a pace that all but the most bigoted could cope with. High levels of emmigration counterbalanced the influx and even during the 1950s and 60s, when Britain was supposedly 'flooded' with immigrants, the net migration averaged at about 12,000 a year. But during the last decade, two things have changed dramatically. First, the level of net migration has risen to between 200,000 to 300,000 per year - in context, this is the equivalent to adding the population of the city of Brighton and Hove every year. Second, the distribution of migrants has been over a much wider area, often in places that had been untouched by earlier waves of immigration. In Wisbech, for example, around a third of the population are now of Eastern European origin.Many voiced their fears about the rising level of immigration, but were frequently dismissed as racists. The famous encounter between Gordon Brown and Gillian Duffy perfectly summed up the divide between the metropolitan classes and those who felt left behind in a changing society. Why did people feel so threatened? Was it simple bigotry, or a legitimate objection to the workings of global capital? I can only offer anecdotal evidence, but I think it might be pertinent.A few years ago, I worked for a business that employed 200 people in a huge warehouse. When I started, the workforce consisted entirely of locals, then one week, a few Latvians joined. From the moment they started, it was clear that the Latvians were superior to their English counterparts: harder working, mostly better educated and nearly always far more motivated. The management took notice and recruited more.My work often took me to other recycling companies and, time after time, I saw migrants working uncomplainingly in often awful conditions, doing dull, repetitive work in dim, unheated warehouses. The local people, who didn't find the minimum wage as alluring as their Eastern European colleagues, struggled to compete and began to resent the rising local rents and competition for work.When the mainstream political parties failed to take the issue of immigration seriously, those who felt ignored and disenfranchised voted for UKIP in increasing numbers. David Cameron won the last election by undermining UKIP with the promise of a referendum. History may remember him as the man who unwittingly sacrificed Great Britain to win an election. The referendum campaign has been a pretty lamentable affair, full of bigotry, hysteria, cheap sentiment and misinformation on both sides. Interestingly, although many dubious figures were bandied around, the economic arguments had far less impact than the ones based on principles. I think the decision to vote to leave the EU was a desperate act by those who felt that this was their last chance to halt a tide of change that had already made the English an ethnic minority in London.The fact that only half of the net annual migration came from within the EU was never really highlighted. EU migrants were also increasingly blamed for the rise in house prices when, in truth, they were only one factor in a complex picture. Overall, I didn't witness any real anti-European sentiment, even towards the migrants from Eastern Europe. In the warehouse I worked next to, the attitude was more one of \"You can't blame them for coming here, but where will it all end?\". However, there was a real, visceral anger towards the middle classes, the institution of the EU and the metropolitan elite.This has been a cultural revolution and a consensus has been shattered. In a way, this conversation I had yesterday with my mother is indicative of the mindset of many:\"Well, we won. Now they won't be able to come over here and take our benefits.\"\"But most of them aren't on benefits. They often work a lot harder than we do.\"\"Well then, they won't be able to take our jobs.\"For me, the referendum always felt like a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea. The Leave campaign was dominated by jingoistic rhetoric and unreliable economics. The more sophisticated arguments by figures like Tony Benn, about democracy and accountability, were rarely heard. On the other hand, the Remain campaign conflated the EU with Europe and frequently implied that anyone who voted to leave was a backward-looking racist. As someone pointed out, all racists will vote Leave, but not all Leave voters are racists. The tragedy with this referendum, like the Scottish one, was that it offered only two extremes. I suspect that most Scots would have voted for the 'Devolution Max' option if they'd had the choice, and in Thursday's referendum, more people would have voted to remain in the European Union if a compromise had been on the table. But for the EU, the principle of free movement was non-negotiable. So that's it for Great Britain, probably. Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm and Hitler tried to vanquish Great Britain, but a peaceful referendum succeded where they had failed. There may now be a vacant seat on the UN Security Council and there'll be no Team GB in the 2020 Olympics. It's not all doom and gloom. With around 90% of the UK population, the remaining rump of England and Wales will still be an economic and cultural power, but it won't be the same."},
{"title": "Day Release", "date": "Sunday, June 19, 2016", "text": "As some people who have followed this blog will know, my older son has faced many difficulties over the years and at one point, I wondered if he would ever set foot in a school again, let alone pass any exams. For quite a long time, things looked very bleak. However, I'm pleased to say that the last year has seen a remarkable turnaround. With funding from the local authority, my son has been able to attend a school that caters for children like him and at last, he is beginning to discover his potential. He is particularly interested in science, maths and computing and is getting glowing reports from the teachers, so there's every chance he'll end up being far more successful than me (which wouldn't be that hard). It's a pity that children often have to go through years of hell before they get local authority funding, but better late than never. And from the state's point of view, it's money well spent if a child can be turned from an individual who faces a life on benefits into an employable person. I am now the prime carer in our household and spend most of my time ferrying our sons around, cleaning the house, shopping and cooking. It feels as if that is all I do now (one reason why I look forward to returning to work), but Instagram keeps reminding me that I do occasionally get out. The following photos were all taken in Sussex during the last couple of months:Herstmonceaux Castle. I visited it for the first time recently and was delighted to find that the car park was almost empty. Nothing kills the romance of an ancient castle more than several coachloads of people in pastel leisurewear. Even when the castle is closed, the grounds are still worth seeing.This redundant observatory has been resurrected as a wonderful science museum for children, with lots of hands-on displays that make the official Science Museum in London look rather dull by comparison.Market Street in Lewes during a rare, traffic-free moment. I like the lack of uniformity.The Seven Sisters cliffs at Birling Gap. My sons love to explore the rockpools here. It's not quite the Great Barrier Reef, but it can still yield the odd surprise, from a beach covered in starfish to a woman covered in tattoos of Michael Jackson. Whenever I see a red telephone box, I want to go and and ask for Scotland Yard. I don't know why.My older son, during a rare moment in daylight. I think he was in a good mood because he'd just had an excellent school report; an event that surprised him as much as us. This is a small annex to the bedroom of Rudyard Kipling's son, John, who was killed at the Battle of Loos in 1915.The black house, just next to Lewes Castle, has what are called 'mathematical tiles' - fake bricks, that were used by the Georgians to make older, timber-framed houses look more impressive.This is Bateman's - the 17th century home of Rudyard Kipling. Whether you're interested in the author or not, it's well worth a visit. Market day in Lewes, where the affluent middle classes abandon Waitrose for the day.My favourite car outside one of my favourite pubs. In Lewes, even the cars are half-timbered.Ypres Tower, Rye, where the English kept an eye out for any marauding Frenchmen.An abandoned quarry, just outside Lewes, now largely populated by nervous rabbits and dog owners who assure you that \"He's just being friendly\".The entrance to Rudyard Kipling's library. Whilst browsing through the books, an elderly man came up to me and started to talk about the unexpected death of a middle aged man he knew: \"Chap was about your age.\" I left feeling like a condemned man.This tiny circle of stones appeared, briefly, one afternoon. The next day it was gone. Rudolf Steiner would have probably attributed this to gnomes. Smaller and prettier than Lewes, Rye offers a number of literary curiosities, including the homes of Henry James, Radclyffe Hall, EF Benson and John Christopher. I love Rye, but it is a victim of its own success, with more tourists than locals during the spring and summer.The moon and Jupiter over a Tudor rooftop at twilight. Not great quality, but not bad for a phone.Lewes in the rain. There seems to have been a lot of it recently.This is a close-up of a pillar at Lewes Station. It's being redecorated and the workmen have stripped away decades of layers of paint, leaving a rather interesting abstract design.Lewes Station at twilight, when the station is almost deserted.I never tire of this scene and have photographed it in all weathers. In an ideal world, every town would have a 1000-year-old building at its centre, to give us all a sense of perspective.This is Uckfield - a much-maligned market town near Lewes. It's not the prettiest of places, but the older part of the town is full of hidden delights for anyone who takes the time to explore. Birling Gap, where a child can turn a distant yacht into a pirate ship. I apologise for the mundane nature of this post. I can't promise that the next one will be any better."},
{"title": "The Usual Nonsense", "date": "Tuesday, May 31, 2016", "text": "After a lovely, child-free weekend in Frome last week, the karmic balance is now being restored by the ordeal of a half term holiday. As much as I love my sons, I am getting rather tired of repeating this particular conversation twice a day:\"Dad, can I have something to eat?\"\"Okay, what would you like?\"\"I don't know.\"\"Well that doesn't really get me anywhere. What about some toast?\"\"No thanks.\"\"A croissant?\"\"No, I don't like them any more.\"\"Carrot sticks?\"\"No.\" (said with a weary sigh).\"Well, let's go into the kitchen and see what there is, shall we?\" (said through gritted teeth).We go into the kitchen and despite being presented with a full cupboard of cakes, crisps, biscuits, fresh bread, stale bread, cereal, nuts and various bars, I feel as if I have somehow failed. Eventually, a packet of crisps is begrudgingly accepted and I feel as if I'm the one who is being done a favour. I think my younger son's still cross with me for tumble drying one of our cats (I did stop the machine as soon as I heard a strange bumping noise, I hasten to add).Written down here, it all sounds incredibly petty, but one should never underestimate the power of a dripping tap.Perhaps this was why I found myself being infuriated by almost everything I saw this morning, during a brief shopping trip to Brighton.The chief offenders were as follows:1. Jeans with holes in the knees:I am neither a genuphobe nor a knee fetishist. Indeed, I am completely indifferent on the subject of knees, but these jeans offend me. The ripped jeans of the 80s were pretty daft, but at least the tear appeared vaguely natural. These just look stupid and I feel irrationally annoyed by everyone I see who wears them. 2. Hipster beards:Long beards are fine in the 1892 England cricket team, or at an Iranian theological conference, but on the streets of Brighton they are just irritating. Why are so many young men slavishly following this trend? It's no longer just poncy, middle class men, sitting outside a chi chi cafe, pretending that it's perfectly normal to have a typewriter; I've also seen builders who look like Brahms.I suppose that the one plus side of this trend is that it makes it harder for Islamist gunmen to distinguish between believers and infidels.3. Mad eyebrows:Feeling compelled to pluck one's eyebrows to the point of oblivion is wrong, but the pedulum seems to have swung too far in the other direction, hasn't it? Whose bright idea was it to introduce eyebrows that look like Groucho Marx's moustache? In the history of fashion, I think this trend will be regarded as a brief moment of madness, like bubble skirts and spray-painted DMs.4. Man-buns:I suppose this hairsyle can be useful if you have a bald patch that you want to cover - it's certainly more windproof than the traditional comb-over, but I'm not a fan.It reminds me of those gormless-looking backpackers who use to congregate in Traflagar Square and have a strand of their hair threaded with beads, to show how deep they were: \"I'm part of a global consciousness. I'm really into World music. Let's sing some Manu Chao - has Jens got his didgeridoo on him?\"I know I'm being grumpy and petty. I think it's probably a dental abscess that's exacerbated my mildly misanthropic tendancies. I've been taking antibiotics for over a week and nothing has changed. Perhaps I've entered the post-antibiotic age, in which case I'm doomed.On a more upbeat note, my weekend in Somerset was a pleasure from start to finish. Frome is one of the most interesting and visually appealing towns I've visited, full of eccentric delights. I was also introduced to a beautiful village I'd never heard of, which turned out to be the setting for one of the most notorious murders in Victorian England.The house below features in Kate Summerscale's marvellous book, The Suspicion of Mr Whicher, which I read as soon as I got back from Somerset. It's extraordinary how little both the house and the village appear to have changed, physically, at least. A weekend of good company and interesting discoveries lifted the spirits. There was a time when I wanted to walk the Machu Picchu trail, or go on the Trans-Siberian Railway, but these days a mere two days in Somerset is all I need to clear away the cobwebs."},
{"title": "Mea Cuppa - The Decline of Tea Drinking in Britain", "date": "Sunday, May 08, 2016", "text": "On Twitter last week, Peter Sipe asked me what I thought about a Washington Post article about the decline of tea drinking in Britain (apparently, it's dropped from 68 grams per week in 1974 to 25 grams per week 40 years later). I read it and shuddered with horror. Without a single shot being fired, the British have become a nation of coffee drinkers. It's as if the ravens have left the Tower of London.The Washington Post claims that tea drinking is the most British thing there is, so what has gone wrong? I think there are several possible answers:1. We've gone to the dogsTea was a quintessentially British beverage because it offered a mild, barely perceptible stimulation, as restrained as the twitching upper lip of a dying Spitfire pilot. It was a drink that vicars and maiden aunts could consume it by the gallon without unleashing repressed passions. Labourers cherished it because the act of drinking a cuppa offered a brief, elysian respite from the drudgery of their working day.In recent years, we've turned our backs on moderation and self-control, placing more value on self-expression and cheap sentiment. We began to let it all hang out around the same time that city gents stopped wearing bowler hats (if I had the time, I'm sure that I could plot out a causal relationship) and this was accompanied by a growing preference for stimulants. The 'nice cup of tea' and the traditional pint of warm, weak beer became replaced by amphetamine-like coffees and ever-stronger alcoholic beverages. We went from becoming a nation that kept calm and carried on through the Blitz to one that wept like infants when Princess Diana died. We've gone to the dogs.2. Travel has broadened the mindAround the same time that gentlemen were abandoning their bowler hats, British people were discovering the delights of having a summer holiday in a place where it didn't rain half the time. They loved the climate, but weren't so keen on the cuisine - \"Ooh Joan, you can't get a decent cuppa anywhere and the food's so garlicky\". After a life of eating bland, overcooked food and weak tea, Mediterrnean cuisine must have been as overstimulating as LSD. But after a while, people got a taste for 'foreign muck' and the supermarkets saw a growing demand for more exotic dishes, while old favourites like suet puddings, faggots and fish paste sandwiches saw a steady, inexorable decline. Our changing tastebuds, once shaped by a national cuisine of flavourless food and drink, now sought something a little stronger than tea.3. Tea has got worse while coffee has become nicerHalf a century ago, a cup of tea would have usually been made in the traditional way, with loose leaves in a warmed pot, brewed for at least two minutes before being served in decent china. On the other hand, a cup of coffee would usually look and taste like washing-up water. Then two things happened: some bastard invented the teabag and coffee began to become drinkable. The big coffee revolution took place in the mid-80s, coinciding with the advent of yuppies. I'm pretty sure of this because when I went to university in Wales in the early 80s, coffee in cafes was usually undrinkable, but when I returned to London in 1987, everyone seemed to be drinking cappuccinos. I felt as if I'd been away for 20 years. Coffee became seen as the drink of the cosmopolitan, go-getting white collar worker, while tea was the choice of builders and old people (there isn't time to venture into the dark world of herbal tea here, but it was the drink of choice of some of the worst people I've ever worked with - individuals who'd perfected passive aggressive behaviour into a martial art). Those are my three main theories. I'm not sure which one is the nearest to the truth.I don't have strong feelings about the relative merits of drinking tea versus coffee. I like both, but I dislike the coffee culture that has sprung up during the last 20 years. I'm annoyed by seeing people walk around clutching cardboard cups; perhaps because it represents that whole '24/7' culture of being permanently on the go. Good people fought for their right to have a tea break. Everyone should stop and sit down for 15 minutes. I also hate the wanky 'barista' nonsense, as if operating a coffee making machine is a specialist occupation, like tree surgery and stonemasonry. And why is there so much choice? Maybe we did need something more imaginative than black/white/with/without sugar, but if I offer to buy someone a coffee, I don't expect to have to remember some nonsense about a double skinny mocha decaf latte while I approach the counter. It's symptomatic of a spoilt brat consumer culture, in which all needs and inclinations must be catered for. On the other hand, tea is the drink of a civilised nation. Like coffee it has caffeine, but at a level where it feels like a relaxant rather than a stimulant. Having a cup of tea isn't just about drinking; it's about stopping and gathering's one's thoughts. Unless you have a cast iron esophagus, a cup of tea cannot be drunk quickly and that is one of its greatest virtues.The future looks grim, but the tide may turn and the new generation of young people may turn their backs on skinny mochas, tattoos and long beards. I live in hope. In the meantime, my household will continue to drink tea in the afternoon, accompanied by a slice of something nice. I will finish with this homage to tea by Chap Hop artist Professor Elemental:"},
{"title": "And the Beat Goes On", "date": "Sunday, April 10, 2016", "text": "The school holidays seem to have lasted for at least six weeks, but the calendar says otherwise. Determined to get my money's worth from our National Trust and English Heritage membership cards, I've subjected my younger son to a gruelling tour of castles, stately homes and parks. His older brother has remained in his room, mostly sleeping, like someone in cryogenic suspension on an interstellar voyage. I find the planning and recollection of days out much better than the thing itself. The reality is usually either slight disappointment, or an awareness of being detached from the thing I am looking at and wondering why. But occasionally, something serendipitous happens that negates the angst. My last moment of serendipity happened recently, on a mild, end of March day. I was sitting on a bench, by the ramparts of an 11th century castle and could hear birdsong, a cock crowing and the sound of people singing in the nearby parish church - it was Good Friday. At one point, a brimstone butterfly fluttered past and I remembered why I love this time of year so much.On the way home, I picked up my mother and brought her to have lunch with us. As she struggled to get into the car, she suddenly said \"I'm running out of books. Can you get me some more on your thing?\" I've ordered so many books for my mother, Amazon now thinks that my literary tastes revolve solely around tales of working class girls who become impregnated by the local squire's son.

It used to be by the coast, before the sea disappeared.   This doorway appears to be the only surviving remnant of a much older building than the one behind it, but I can't find any information on the internet.

What do you think?\" A loaded question.My son scrutinised it for a few seconds and I hoped that sanity would prevail. \"Oh yes, it's beautiful.\"I was outvoted and looked at the vile object, mocking me with its faux illustrations of food labels. Another nail in the coffin.But during the night, one of our cats was sick on it. They have never vomitted on the table before, so I felt vindicated. Later I noticed that the tablecloth had been folded up and put away. I felt sorry for my wife (but not sorry enough to take it out again) and resolved to think of something that might cheer her up. We all need treats, however small. It was my birthday recently and I treated myself to two Jasper Conran shirts and eight novels. If that sounds self-indulgent, I should add that I still had change from a £20 note, as they'd all been bought in charity shops. I love buying paperbacks in charity shops because the selection is completely unpredicatble. During the last month, I've read an ecclectic range of novels including Dead Man Leading by V.S. Pritchett, London Belongs to Me by Norman Collins and The Plot Against America by Philip Roth. I particularly enjoyed the latter, as it seemed so chillingly apposite in light of the Donald Trump candidacy, showing how quickly democracy can be debased.There seem to be certain types of people who work in charity shops and I keep seeing their doppelgängers wherever I go: a gay man in his 60s, usually wearing a bright, lambswool sweatera woman in her 50s who likes to talka rough-looking man who is probably serving a community sentence a silent, terrified-looking girl in her late teens/early 20sa young man with learning difficultiesan elderly woman who can't work the till They are a strange coalition of the retired, the marginalised and the disenfranchised. Uncelebrated and undervalued. When I saw a customer being rude to a charity shop worker, I wanted to remind her that she was talking to a volunteer. I'm still selling books, in between domestic duties and childcare. I have around 7,000 books on sale, which generates a few dozen orders a week. Sadly, the gap between the overheads - postage and rent - and the total sales is narrowing, leaving me with a dilemma. Should I keep going in the hope that I can find a new supplier, or give up the ghost once the profits reach double figures?Like Mr Micawber (surely one of the most annoying characters in literature) I'm sure that something will turn up.In the meantime, here are a few photos from the last few weeks:Lewes had a few misty mornings (as did most places, I believe). Somehow, black and white seemed right for this picture.I took my sons to the Bluebell Railway the other day. In a masterstroke of frugality, I discovered that platform tickets were only £3 for adults and £1.50 for children, as opposed to £45.40 for a ride on a train. My younger son said he'd happily forgo the ride for a lolly. My older son said that steam trains were 'gay'.While I was admiring the ingenuity of the Victorian engineering, my wife turned to me and said \"I hope you're not turning into one of those odd men.\" I must stop now and feed the cats. I've bought them two tins of Lily's Kitchen as a reward for bad behaviour."},
{"title": "Home Alone", "date": "Saturday, February 27, 2016", "text": "It has now been four months since my wife returned to full time work and I became a 'househusband'. Neither of us planned it that way, but as my wife can't drive and the school run is now a 25-mile round trip along country roads, our options were rather limited. I decided to embrace my role and Googled the term househusband. One of the first things I saw was a link to a Daily Mail article: 'You Can Never Fancy a Man Who Becomes a House Husband.' Apparently, pink marigolds on men are a turn-off, unless you like that sort of thing (there are probably websites).At first I had trouble adjusting to the sudden change. I was used to being the breadwinner (albeit a very cheap loaf of Kingsmill sliced white) and felt as if I had somehow let the side down. However, I was hardly idle. On an average morning, I took my sons to their schools, popped over to my office to deal with any book orders, did some food shopping, then drove home and began cleaning the house.I valued my wife's work when she stayed at home, so why did I feel at such a loss? Gender conditioning, I suppose.In spite of this, I was happy for my wife. She seemed to be doing very well in her new job and came home energised and full of gossip. My anecdotes were rather more mundane: \"I cleaned the oven, but I'm not using Mr Muscle again.\"Fortunately, I have started to get a more balanced perspective on the situation and accept that even if my current existence is very dull, it is entirely necessary. Those ovens won't clean themselves.There has also been another change during the last month. My mother has suddenly become very frail and is increasingly dependent on me, both practically and emotionally.The practical side is easy. I don't mind buying the Werther's Originals or dealing with the bills from Damart, but the emotional support is more challenging, as my mother can be relentlessly morbid to a point where I leave feeling thoroughly depressed. However, I know that when someone is virtually housebound, they need constant visits. At least I will no longer hear about Vera's leg, which my mother would describe in graphic detail before I pleaded with her to stop. Vera is now in Florida with her daughter, for a long holiday. \"She won't be coming back,\" my mother said, with barely-concealed relish. Sometimes I can feel my mood sliding. When that happens, unless it's absolutely pissing down outside, I go for a walk. Being in the fresh air, smelling the damp earth and feeling the pale winter sun, clears away the cobwebs and puts everything in perspective. I don't what I'd do if I lived in Neasden. Perhaps I'd go to Ikea and pretend I lived in one of the rooms. These photos were taken during the last few weeks. I particularly like the one of a hat, which is a lost property item in Berwick Church. There's a story behind that picture."},
{"title": "National Savings", "date": "Monday, February 08, 2016", "text": "I am a product of the National Savings Bank. My parents both worked at its head office in Kew and after a whirlwind 13-year courtship, they decided to get engaged. The other day I found some photos of the NSB, taken between the late 1940s and the early 60s, when my parents married and my mother accepted a 'dowry' in lieu of a pension. I told my mother about the pictures but she showed no interest in seeing them. However, she did tell me a few anecdotes.I learned that the women were all expected to arrive at work wearing white gloves and that if a pair of shoes hadn't been polished properly, a reprimand would follow. In the early 60s, a young man, who had clearly fallen under the malign influence of the Beatles, arrived looking slightly scruffy and was given a stern talking to. The next day he turned up in a top hat and tails. I also learned more about the notorious serial killer John Christie, who worked in the same department as my father. Apparently, Christie had asked my mother's friend Doris out on a date, but after some deliberation she decided to say no. After Christie's arrest and execution, Doris was haunted by the thought of what could have been. Serial killers aside, it sounded like a very ordered, regimented world. I had to get my mother to explain the many acronyms she kept mentioning - CAs, COs, HCOs, EOs and HEOs and tried to estimate out how many Clerical Assistants and Clerical Officers there were under under Higher Clerical Officer, before I began to get a sense of how it all worked. At lunchtime, everyone would file into the huge staff canteen and the CAs, COs, EOs and HCOs would all sit on separate tables, never fraternising with each other. If a newcomer accidentally sat at the wrong table, they would politely put straight and shown where they would be sitting tomorrow. My mother was given special projects, as she had a particular aptitude for numbers. At one point she uncovered a serious case of internal fraud and reported it, but nobody dared to take action. Frustrated by the inertia of her employers, my mother wrote a 'humorous' poem about it for the staff journal. Every copy was seized and the offending poem was scored out, badly, before the journal was recirculated.In the early days, the offices were dominated by women that my mother referred to as old biddies. They should have retired, but had kept going while the men were serving in the armed forces. My mother disliked their austere manner and drab clothes and was glad when the office began to fill with younger men. But not all of the men were fit for work. Some had been irreparably damaged by the War and struggled to get through the working day. One man had been held a prisoner of war by the Japanese and regularly suffered from bouts of malaria, during which he sometimes thought that he was back in the jungle. Another sat alone in the corner, reeking of whisky, looking broken. Life at the Bank was governed by strict rules and regulations, but it wasn't a completely sterile, joyless environment. It had its own library and organised trips up to town to see the latest ballets, concerts and plays (on one occasion, my father saw my ballet dancing mother-in-law on the stage, blissfully aware that their paths would cross 30 years later). My parents were both very happy at the bank and regarded it as a huge improvement on the jobs they began they working lives with: an electrician and an assistant in a chemist's. My father even began to think of himself as middle class. My mother never did.My father would have happily have stayed at the National Savings Bank until retirement, but the Government decided to start moving Civil Service jobs away from London and his job ended up in Glasgow. As none of us would have made very good Glaswegians, my father reluctantly moved to another department and ended up doing something far more enjoyable.For a generation blighted by two world wars and the poverty of the 1930s, the Civil Service offered an alluring security. If you were working or lower middle class, with no capital or assets to speak of, the job security and attractive pension made it a good career choice.But what's this? Miss Clutterbuck is outside without her white gloves on! The strumpet. I bet she didn't last long."},
{"title": "Julian Barnes and The Noise of Time, or The Wrong Trousers", "date": "Thursday, February 04, 2016", "text": "The first decade of the Soviet Union was an extraordinarily creative period, during which the iconoclasm of the avant garde seemed in perfect harmony with the spirit of the Revolution (never mind the fact that Fred at the 37th Tractor Combine just wanted a nice painting of a dacha with roses around the door. Not some geometric nonsense).  In music, a 19-year-old called Dmitri Shostakovich made a big impression with a new symphony. It was a graduation piece and while Shostakovich's teacher, Glazunov, approved of the nods to Rimsky Korsakov and Tchaikovsky, he was appalled by the modernism that had crept into his studious young pupil's music.What a racket!But this was only the beginning. In his next symphony, Shostakovich completely threw off the shackles of the past and filled his score with dense, polytonal passages, factory sirens and a rousing choral finale praising the October Revolution. This was Soviet art; part of a milieu that included Eisenstein, Malevich and Mayakovsky. But then Stalin happened and everything changed. Now the avant garde were accused of being bourgeois and anti-Soviet. What's the point of a painting if the proletariat can't understand what it means? What use is an opera if it can't be whistled by a factory worker? This decadent, degenerate nonsense had to stop.Julian Barnes's new novel, The Noise of Time, was published on the 80th anniversary of a notorious newspaper article in Pravda called 'Muddle Instead of Music', written after Stalin had attended a performance of Shostakovich's opera Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk. The production was a huge success with the public, but that didn't cut any ice with the Great Leader, who was appalled by what he saw.  To Stalin and his cronies, both the music and narrative were a disgrace to Soviet art. Where were the folk-inspired melodies extolling the virtues of the latest five-year plan? Why were the authorities portrayed as figures of fun?'Muddle Instead of Music' named and shamed Shostakovich, accusing him of writing music that was \"coarse, primitive and vulgar\". The composer was, it claimed, guilty of writing an anti-Soviet opera that tickled \"the tastes of the bourgeois.\" The article reached the following conclusion:\"The power of good music to infect the masses has been sacrificed to a petty-bourgeois, 'formalist' attempt to create originality through cheap clowning. It is a game of clever ingenuity that may end very badly.\"In a climate in which people were being routinely arrested and executed for the most spurious reasons, the final sentence sounded like a death warrant. Shostakovich, already a nervous man, was utterly terrified.Shostakovich, looking slightly worriedThe Noise of Time takes this incident as its starting point and goes on to examine Shostakovich's troubled relationship with the Soviet authorities and his attempts to appease his masters without completely compromising his integrity as an artist. As a fan of Shostakovich, I didn't like the idea of Julian Barnes appropriating the facts of the composer's life for a work of fiction. It can seem like a vain conceit to speak on behalf of the dead. It is also an unnecessary one, when they have left behind a body of work that speaks for itself. Still, better Barnesy than Amis. And to a large extent, Barnes has pulled it off, giving us a narrative that is not only rigorously faithful to the facts, but also to the man himself. If you want to have a sense of what it is like to be an artist in a totalitarian regime, you could do a lot worse than read The Noise of Time. After the 'Muddle' episode, Shostakovich was now an enemy of of the people and had a packed suitcase ready for the moment the secret police arrived, but the arrest never happened and gradually, the composer realised that he had an opportunity to appease his persecutors. Operas were out - anything involving the written word was a bad idea - so he worked on a new symphony. The result, branded by one journalist \"A Soviet artist's reply to just criticism\", was a success with both the public and the authorities.Julian Barnes makes a lot of the 5th Symphony's deliberately banal, crowd-pleasing ending, but fails to mention the tragic slow movement, which had much of the audience in floods of tears because they felt that the music articulated something that nobody dared to utter. This is important, because it shows that Shostakovich's response was more enigmatic and nuanced than the text implies.In addition to the musical omissions, I also felt that The Noise of Time read more like an essay than a novel and its brevity sometimes made it feel like a Cliff Notes guide to Stalinism. But quibbles aside, I liked the book far more than I thought I would. It succeeds brilliantly at conveying the absurdity and obscenity of Stalinism, but also shows how the thaw under Khrushchev offered a different kind of existential threat.The narrative was also punctuated with many memorable anecdotes, the most telling of which was the fact that Stalin's guards always kept a spare pair of trousers handy, as so many terrified film directors and artists soiled themselves in the presence of the Man of Steel. Shostakovich witnessed one of these incidents at a film premier, when Stalin's gruff response to a message he'd been handed was misconstrued by the director. Convinced that he was destined for the gulag or the firing squad, the poor man disgraced himself before passing out.I finished the book full of admiration for Julian Barnes, but I still believe that the best account of the Stalinist period is probably the first movement of Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No.1. Written in 1948 and kept in a drawer until two years after Stalin's death, this dark, brooding music is one of the bleakest things I have ever heard, but it is utterly brilliant:"},
{"title": "Gnomes and Dwarves", "date": "Wednesday, January 20, 2016", "text": "It has been an uneventful week. My mother was completely nonplussed by David Bowie's death, complaining that her Daily Mail had too many articles about him:\"There were 13 pages. 13! I can't think of anything he's done.\"I mentioned The Laughing Gnome, which my mother remembered from Junior Choice, but the rest of Bowie's oeuvre has passed her by. In fairness, she was in her early 40s when David Bowie began to make a name for himself. What little interest in popular music my mother had, ended with Nina and Frederik.(After retiring at the peak of his career, Frederik went on to briefly own Burke's peerage, before moving to the Philippines, where his yacht was used to transport cannabis. He died from gunshot wounds in 1994). I may laugh at my mother's ignorance of popular culture, but the truth is that my parents were far more au fait with the charts than I am, as the day would always begin with Radio Two (I have a distinct memory of my father shaving over the kitchen sink, listening to Tony Orlando and Dawn singing Knock Three Times). I can't remember the last time I knew what Number One was.A few days later, Alan Rickman died. My mother had never heard of him, while another person thought he was the pop musician who appeared on Grumpy Old Men.I despair. After a rather odd Christmas, life has returned to normal. My days are shaped around taking and collecting my sons to their respective schools and while the driving can be a little tedious, at least it takes me through some beautiful countryside. I enjoy seeing how much the same landscape can change according to the weather and time of day. To make the journey pass more quickly, my younger son and I have started listening to audio plays. We tried a very enjoyable 1950s NBC radio series called X Minus One (thank you to Val for the link) and are now working our way through the BBC adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. I'd forgotten how annoying Gimli the Dwarf was, always droning on about his dull ancestors. In between driving, posting book orders and being a housewife, I occasionally stop to take a snap of anything that catches my eye. Here are some things from the last few weeks:I will soon have more photos of Lewes than Google Earth."},
{"title": "Chaos Theory", "date": "Tuesday, January 12, 2016", "text": "This evening, my wife returned from her new publishing job and gave me a brief overview of the highlights of her working day. I half listened, until she mentioned that 200 envelopes had been returned to her workplace by the Post Office: \"They contained catalogues that we'd posted to bookshops. They were sent back because none of those shops exist any more.\"I'd become used to the slow process of attrition that has seen the number of British bookshops halve in seven years, but the image of the 200 returned catalogues really hit home. I wondered what the booksellers who'd worked in those shops were doing now.For their sake, I hope that none of them ended up in the bookshop I visited today: a sorry affair that has crossed the line from eccentricity to neglect, with piles of unsorted stock, shelves that appear on the verge of collapse and an all-pervading smell of body odour and stale tobacco.In one section, an elderly man with a respiratory problem rummaged through a pile of Pan paperbacks, pausing only to glare at me and mark his territory with extended elbows. In another, a sparrow-faced woman in her 60s looked nervously at me, as if I was about to perform an indecent act. I tried moving to a different floor, but heard a man chanting \"Mmm...umm...hmph...mee...\" and made a swift exit.This was bookishness in the worst sense of the word: dysfunctional, misanthropic and obsessive. I wondered what the staff thought of their clientele, before I realised that some of the customers were the booksellers. But experience has taught me that when I find myself repulsed by something, it is often a smokescreen for something I see in myself. Perhaps I still might become the wheezy old man who smells of stale cake and uses his elbows to deter others. It seems perverse that this bookshop has survived while far better ones have gone to the wall, but I suspect that its overheads are fairly low and that the building is owned rather than leased. The stock itself is reasonably good and it seems a pity that so much of it is inaccessible. I saw a lot of dead stock obscuring the more sellable titles.I can feel a quest coming on. If anyone can recommend a decent secondhand bookshop in the south of England (or beyond, as I want to travel around the UK this year), with a good selection of paperback novels, I'd really appreciate it."},
{"title": "Mother Dear", "date": "Thursday, December 24, 2015", "text": "My mother will be joining us for Christmas Day, so I'm steeling myself for an afternoon of anecdotes about the illnesses of people I barely know:Maureen won't be able to go to Janet and Ken's for Christmas. She's having a tube fitted.Doris didn't send a card this year. I wonder if the ulcer's come back. Her cat died last year.Irene wants to come for tea, but she can't swallow any more. I'll make a milk jelly.He was about your age and he just dropped dead. Nobody expected it. He was coloured.Vera was going to go back to Florida to die, but they don't have a Tesco there.I've told Jean that I'm diabetic. She says that I can have Rich Tea biscuits.  That woman in the hairdresser who has a funny friendship with Lynn - she's been very ill. Norman has a pacemaker, but it's not working. He collapsed during Strictly.If it's a good day, I'll be able to steer my mother away from her morbid preoccupation with illness and tell me about what life was like in the 1930s and 40s. They are far more entertaining than the latest progress report about Vera's leg.I thought I'd heard all of my mother's anecdotes about the War, but the other day she told me a new one.It was 1940 and my mother was reaching the end of a piano lesson. Her teacher had just rapped her on the knuckles for making a mistake when suddenly, an air raid siren sounded. \"You need to leave now. I have another girl waiting in the hall.\"\"But my mum says I have to stay where I am when a raid's on.\"\"No! You must go home now. Come along.\"As the front door of the piano teacher's house slammed shut, the bombs started to fall and my mother ran through the streets, weeping. Behind her, a terraced house took a direct hit, creating a sudden gap in the neat, Victorian row. My mother ran on, wondering if she would ever reach home. She never had another piano lesson after that incident.I often ask my mother to repeat the same stories about her childhood, so that I can remember them well enough to pass them on. They are nearly always interesting, even when the subject matter is mundane, simply because they are eye witness accounts of a period that is long gone. I also enjoy the obsolete slang and the way that most of my mother's sentences begin with \"Any rate...\" One of the most magical things I saw recently was a clip posted by a Facebook friend, featuring two Devonshire women of my mother's age: This generation, made up of people whose formative years were in a world without television, won't be around for much longer. Their memories of horse-drawn carts, Sunday best and mangles will disappear into the ether unless we talk to them now. Even if I am losing the will to live tomorrow, assailed by gloomy tales of gammy legs and failing pacemakers, I will remember to be grateful that my mother is still here. I'll miss her when she's gone. P.S. - Christmas Day was a success. The issue of Vera's leg was never raised and the only revelation from my mother concerned the entertainer, Anita Harris (link provided for those who have never heard of her):\"My brother was obsessed with Anita Harris. If she ever appeared on the telly, he'd be in a bad mood for the rest of the day.\""},
{"title": "Acceptance", "date": "Thursday, December 10, 2015", "text": "It's eight years since I worked in a bookshop at Christmas, but even now a split second of 'Let it Snow' makes me flinch like a dog that has been kicked too many times. It's too late to change. Nineteen Christmases in bookselling have reduced my festive spirit to a shrivelled husk. Why did I do it?On reflection, my relationship with bookselling has mirrored Elizabeth Kübler-Ross's model for the five stages of grieving:1. Denial: This is just a temporary expedient while I find something that is more suited to my talents.2. Anger: It's been two years now. I'm skint and I still have no idea what to do with my life.3. Bargaining: While I'm here, I may as well apply for that floor mananger job in Kingston.4. Depression: I've just turned 30 and I'm still working in a bookshop. What a loser.5. Acceptance: Actually, there are worse jobs than this. At least I'm a manager now. The pay is better, the work can be interesting and most of my colleagues are lovely people. As time went on I began to appreciate my work far more, particularly when I worked for Ottakar's. How many other jobs would have given me the opportunity to discuss bedtime reading with Katie Price, or bemoan the state of the book trade with Jacqueline Wilson while sitting on a moving merry-go-round?But the price for these precious moments was a heavy one: Christmas. I'm not just talking about the Phil Spector loop tapes, but also the sheer volume of books that had to be sold in November and December. It was exhausting.Most branches of retail sensibly spread their sales across the year. However, in the book trade, 50% of the income is earned during the last ten weeks of the year and much of that money comes from a relatively small selection of bestsellers - usually hardbacks that consist of the following:Two ghostwritten celebrity memoirs, one of which will be by someone in EastendersA sci-fi/fantasy novel by a man called TerryThe new Patricia Cornwell thrillerThe Guinness Book of RecordsA biography of a very dull sportsperson/yachtswoman/commentatorA quirky, humourous title that has taken everyone by surpriseA Jamie Oliver cookery bookA Nigella Lawson cookery bookA tie-in with a television series on BBC1, usually presented by a man called DavidThe Booker Prize winner, if it's by an author whose name is pronounceableA misery memoir of horrific child abuse - Happy Christmas!A beautiful children's pop-up book, handmade by Bolivian peasants earning 50p an hourA stocking filler about bodily functionsThe Friendship Book These books will be given as presents and very few people will actually ever read them, but they are the bread and butter of the publishing industry, making the difference between profit and loss.As a manager, I knew that my head was on the block. If I ran out of any bestselling titles, it was a big black mark. However, if I ordered too much stock and was still stuck with it on December 27th, I would also be in trouble. In addition to the bestellers, there were plenty of other things that could go wrong and at some point in the early hours of the morning, I would often wake up and go through tedious lists in my head:Did we have enough Book Tokens?Remember to increase the change float for the weekend.Find out if any of the weekend staff can cover if someone phones in sick.Don't forget to check that we have enough carrier bags.Get more of that bestelling pop-up book because it won't be reprinted before Christmas.Mustn't forget to refresh the window display.Tell X that they can't block the fire exit with boxes.Check last year's sales to see how many Jamie Olivers sold in the final week.Make sure the sale posters have arrived.Check WH Smith to see if they're selling Y for less than us.What sort of person lies awake at night worrying about carrier bags? But like the nail that lost the kingdom in the famous nursery rhyme, their absence would spell disaster. And if we ran out of change, then harikiri was the only viable option.The challenge of having to take five times as much money, unpack five times as many deliveries and have enough staff to cover these tasks (and the extended opening hours) was a daunting prospect, but I learned how to avoid the pitfalls and genuinely enjoyed the challenge and camaraderie. I miss that moment on Christmas Eve, after the doors have finally closed, when you know that the madness is over for another year and that in spite of sickness, missing deliveries and dreadful weather, you've pulled it off. After wishing the staff a Happy Christmas, you walk around the empty shop and take stock (not literally, I hasten to add), looking at the books that surprised everyone by becoming bestsellers and those that were supposed to, but didn't. Your 16-year-old self would probably be rather disappointed that you've ended up running a shop, but there's not much call for third-rate composers these days and after all, this is a bookshop. So many people would think that having a whole bookshop to yourself is heaven and suddenly, you realise that they're right."},
{"title": "Flux", "date": "Thursday, November 19, 2015", "text": "It's now a month since my wife returned to full time work for the first time since the last century. I've teased her about how much things have changed, pointing out that they don't use floppy disks any more, but in fact she's made the transition with remarkable ease. After sixteen challenging years of motherhood, my wife is more than ready for a change. But there is one new practice that has really bothered my wife: \"Why are so many people now ending their emails with Kind Regards? It's nonsense.\" My days follow a strict routine, beginning with a 25-mile round trip taking my sons to their respective schools. I then drive to work and deal with my book orders, which seem to be slowly diminishing. I usually have lunch at home, as the faint aroma of dead rats doesn't whet my appetite, then I clean the house, do the laundry and cook, before repeating the school run. I'm bored silly by the whole thing, but it will only last for two years, hopefully. My main aim at the moment is to try not to go potty. It feels as if I have spent the last month indoors, but these Instagram photos prove otherwise:I heard yesterday that my old Greek Philosophy lecturer died a few days ago. He taught me two very important things that have served me well. First, he told me how bad my English was - I was educated during a period when good grammar and spelling were regarded as unacceptably elitist and my howlers were never corrected. Second, he taught me about the Heraclitan Doctrine of Flux: everything in the universe is constantly changing and you cannot step into the same river twice.The Doctrine of Flux has been particularly comforting. Whenever I have moments of existential angst during the tedium of the school run, I can console myself with the knowledge that contrary to appearances, I am driving along a different road each time. I was going to go out, but it appears to have started raining again. Perhaps there's some dusting that needs doing."},
{"title": "A Mere Bagatelle", "date": "Thursday, October 22, 2015", "text": "The other evening I arranged to meet a friend for a drink in Hastings. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but the train journey was hellish: standing room only, with a very rum selection of passengers. The experience was made even worse by the family below:The group consisted of two women - possibly mother and daughter - and an assortment of noisy, feral children who kept running around and disappearing under tables and seats (if you look carefully, you'll see a face slightly to the left of the baby). The younger children were all barefoot and liked dashing in and out of the loo, which is not something I'd want to do without shoes on.At first, I thought the women belonged to a certain stereotype - they had the cheap leisurewear, tied-up hair and harsh accents. But then they started talking about visits to Pevensey Castle and a workshop they'd just been to. Also, the whole family were busy feasting on fresh fruit and drinking pure juice, so my crude social classification radar was starting to overheat in the face of so much conflicting data.After 50 minutes of hell, I concluded that they were New Age 'crusties', returning from some sort of alternative 'do' in Brighton. They all seemed very cheerful. It's a pity that they were so oblivious to everyone else's feelings.Fortunately, the journey home was very different - a reward for my earlier trials:I am now four days into my role reversal with my wife. She seems to be doing terribly well in her new job, while my main achievement this week has been to crash the car. I'm waiting to hear whether it can be repaired or not.Despite having its front smashed and losing the engine coolant, the car managed to limp back to Lewes. As I drove, I could see bits falling off. A group of workmen watched me go past and laughed uproariously. The labouring classes can be very unkind sometimes.I'm trying to balance the demands of my business with being a minor domestic god, preparing cooked meals for the evening, keeping the house clean and fitting in a few DIY tasks. I'm doing reasonably well, but I wonder how long it will last before I end up spending my days on the sofa, reading and eating Turkish Delight.When my car was still in one piece, I managed to get around the local area and take some more Instagram photos. I'm posting them because, frankly, it's much easier than trying to think of something interesting or amusing to say.Now that my life is increasingly dull, expect more photos."},

After years of being out of the education system, my older son is happy at his new school and is expected to do well in his exams. He has just turned 16, which seems extraordinary. My younger son is also at a new school and comes home full of enthusiasm, eager to tell us how he has spent his day. The school seems to be preparing its pupils for a forthcoming disaster, as there is a strong emphasis on crafts, woodcraft and self-sufficiency, but I've never seen a classroom with so many happy children. Other schools could learn something. On the downside, my business is slowly dying - partly because I have to spend a sizeable chunk of the day ferrying my sons around, but also because I'm struggling to find a supplier. Two years ago, it was relatively easy to find stock, but the recycling industry is under far more pressure and separating old books is now regarded as too time consuming. But even that isn't the end of the world, as my wife has just managed to secure a job in a publishing company. If we continue to live frugally we should survive.As for me, I will try to juggle the demands of the school run, maintaining my business and running a house, however I realise that this is a normal day for thousands of working mothers, so I won't be expecting a special badge. As long as I have a strict routine, it should be straightforward enough. In my darker moments, I worry about what I'll be doing in a few years' time, but that's an utterly pointless activity. The important thing is to focus on the present and make the most of it.On the subject of making the most of the present, here's another batch of photos that I uploaded to Instagram recently. It's just a random selection of shots of East Sussex, but they all capture different aspects of the things I like about the local area at this time of year:"},
{"title": "Music For Grown-Ups", "date": "Monday, October 05, 2015", "text": "The other morning I found myself admiring The Cruel Sea, for the umpteenth time. So many British war films of the 1950s perpetuate the myths that were created to boost morale and have a crass, triumphalist tone. However, The Cruel Sea feels like a film for grown-ups.One of the key elements that helps to define the film's tone is one that I suspect many people overlook: Alan Rawsthorne's marvellous score.Take this scene for example, in which HMS Compass Rose is making its maiden voyage. In the hands of a lesser composer, the music would probably be very upbeat and bombastic, but Rawsthorne has written something far more interesting: (For some reason, the clip doesn't play on some phones)When a handful of dockyard workers cheer from the quay, instead of adding a patriotic flourish, Rawsthorne's music emphasises the pathos of the scene, with the young, inexperienced officer shyly half-saluting in reply, as the small, vulnerable corvette leaves the safety of its harbour. The atmosphere reminds me a little of a Ravillious painting, from his time as a War Artist.The use of music is also particularly effective in the next clip, setting the scene, but also knowing when to quietly bow out so that the most harrowing moments take place in silence. The two sailors are the brother and husband-to-be of a widow called Mrs Bell:And in the film's key scene, there is no music at all. Jack Hawkins doesn't need any help:Of course, the brilliance of The Cruel Sea is a team effort and with names like Eric Ambler, Charles Frend, Michael Balcon, Jack Hawkins, Denholm Eliot, Virginia McKenna and Nicholas Montsarrat, it would be hard to produce a dud. But I think Alan Rawsthorne's score is definitely the icing on the cake, imbuing the narrative with a bleak, resigned stoicism.These days, far too much film music is usually cliché-ridden and uninspiring, with an emotional palette that rarely progresses beyond happy, sad, in love, danger, funny and mysterious. Indeed, in music, 'filmic' is now a euphemism for overblown, melodramatic and sentimental and when I hear the soundtracks for films like Lord of the Rings, I feel a sense of despair.I'm not sure exactly why the rot set in, but I'm pretty sure that it all went wrong after Star Wars, but that's a rant for another day."},
{"title": "\"French Suite, First Floor\"", "date": "Tuesday, September 29, 2015", "text": "Perhaps it's the male menopause, if such a thing exists, but the other day I did something I thought I'd never do. I'd learned about it almost by accident and was told that I would find the house down a small dark alley where, if I knocked on the right door, I would be shown upstairs to a room where a woman called Marcia would entertain me.It was my first clavichord recital. The clandestine recital took place in a small medieval building. By day, it houses a workshop, where harpsichords and replicas of other early keyboard instruments are built.I'd seen some of the instruments a couple of weeks earlier at an open day and was speechless with admiration at their perfection. Every detail, right down to the creation of the metal strings, reflected a painstaking process that required a rare marriage of artistic and technical acumen. When someone mentioned that they occasionally held recitals, I had to go.The soloist was an elegant, refined woman called Marcia Hadjimarkos, who introduced the pieces she was playing and talked a little about the instrument. \"I don't know how you feel about clapping, but perhaps you'd just like to wave your programmes in between pieces and clap at the end. If you feel like clapping.\" And we did exactly that, with a ripple of muted, embarrassed laughter.If I'd started filming in the middle of the recital, things might have turned ugly, so here's a clip of Marcia Hadjimarcos playing the fortepiano, with an introduction in French. It's an odd instrument, with a lid, or swell, that keeps opening and closing. At one point I expected Sooty to appear.Unlike the fortepiano, the clavichord doesn't have any pedals and it was extraordinary to hear the soloist produce such a wide dynamic range. A vibrato effect was created by wobbling the finger on the key, while pianissimo was achieved by an extreme delicacy of touch.In the interval, I was fortunate enough to meet the woman who built the clavichord and she kindly responded to my inane questions with patience and charm. I hope I didn't come across as a complete idiot.As for the music, it took a little while to learn to listen properly, but once I was in the 'zone' (partly thanks to a glass of wine in the interval), I found the recital increasingly rewarding. Listening to Bach's French Suites, with their extraordinary, almost electronic timbre, was a revelation. By the time I heard the exquisite encore, I was a convert. There's something quite magical about an intimate recital in a medieval building, listening to music as it would have been heard three centuries ago. The phrase 'early music' used to bring me out in a cold sweat, but now I can see what I've been missing. Better late than never."},
{"title": "The Clichés of Instagram", "date": "Sunday, September 20, 2015", "text": "It's good to have a hobby and as stamp collecting probably wouldn't provide the same frisson as it did when I was 13, I've become increasingly preoccupied with Instagram. Seeing a random selection of pictures from around the world is fascinating and I also enjoy uploading snapshots and receiving 'likes' from complete strangers. It may seem a small pleasure, but it's very gratifying to know that someone has enjoyed looking at one of my photos for 1.3 seconds.However, my love of Instagram is not unqualified and there are a few themes (or should that be memes?) that I'm thoroughly fed up with.Here are a few of my main irritants:1. The Cup of CoffeeWhy would anyone want to see a photo of someone else's cup of coffee? I've no idea, but there are thousands of pictures on Instagram that people have taken of their favourite beverage (very rarely tea, for some reason). I know that coffee comes in many varieties, but you wouldn't know that from looking at the endless shots of frothy hearts in white cups.I appreciate that people are sharing something that has made them happy and yes, it's lovely that the barista has done a little squiggly design in the froth to distract customers from the exorbitant price. But are the identikit coffees of global corporations sufficiently interesting to warrant photographing?Probably not.2. FeetI'll come clean here and admit that I have whatever the opposite is of a foot fetish. If I had my way, everyone over the age of 12 would be banned from wearing sandals or flip flops and socks would be compulsory. But prejudices aside, what possesses so many people to think that it's a quirky, original idea to photograph their feet? I never ceased to be amazed at the number of 'foot selfies' on Instagram and wish that there was a shoe button I could press to filter them out.3. The 'Inspirational' Quote.Uploading quotes onto Instagram is just wrong It's a site for sharing photographs, not moronoic platitudes that collapse under the most casual scrutiny. \"It's a good day to have a good day\"?Let's just hang that one up on the wall of an oncology ward. They'll love it.And to \"Be who you are, not what the world wants you to be\" is just self-centred nonsense. In the real world, who we are is a necessary compromise between our own desires and the needs of others. It's called civilisation. Those are my top three. I'd also rather not see so many pictures of cats, Big Ben, poppies, white balloons, tattoos and Amsterdam, but I won't even try to justify those prejudices  (and of course, it's quite likely that someone is looking at my photos and tutting at their predictability and narrow range of themes, along with the paucity of uplifting thoughts and feet). But even clichés can be good in the right hands. Look at what this photographer has done with a hackneyed, familiar scene:The same photographer also managed to come up with a stunning photo of Big Ben:I'd like to see what he could do with a cup of coffee."},
{"title": "Restless", "date": "Sunday, September 13, 2015", "text": "During the summer I became quite discontented with my house (sadly not the one above), which felt smaller and noisier than ever. Outside, builders shouted, drilled and listened to hideous power ballads. Inside, my wife, sons and cats occupied every room except the main bedroom. At one point I started viewing property websites and looked longingly at houses with spacious kitchens and gardens larger than a bath mat. Many of them had a study and a shed - catnip for a middle aged man - plus the en suite bathroom that my wife has yearned for all these years.To add to the temptation, the houses weren't selling for any more money than the value of our home. If we could buy one of these houses (and somehow lose our cats during the move), how much better life could be. I could have that book-lined study I'd always dreamed about.But the bubble always burst when I clicked on the maps and realised that there is a simple rule to purchasing a property in this area: unless you're blessed with a large sum of money, you can either have a small house in a good location, or a large home in a less desirable one. Invariably, whenever I saw a house I liked, there was a catch.Also, many of the larger houses I saw conformed to Patrick Hamilton's snobbish but amusing description in a book I'm reading at the moment, Mr Stimpson and Mr Gorse:'The houses were squat, two-storied affairs. Their fronts had all been most oddly treated. It looked as if the builder had had some sort of infantile sea-mania for shingled beaches, and that, to indulge this passion, he had, having covered the external walls with thick glue, used some extraordinary machine with which to spray them densely with small pebbles.In the front gardens of most of these houses there were, in addition to sundials, countless images of Gnomes, Dwarfs, Fairies, Goblins, and Peter Pans - the inhabitants of Sispara Road having, it seemed, a strong turn of mind for the whimiscal, the grotesque and the beautiful.'So for the time being, I am staying put in the unpebbledashed, gnome-free streets of Lewes, resigned to living in a terraced Victorian shoebox, but grateful to live in a town that is full of delights, with solid, unpretentious housing. In a vague attempt to improve my fitness and leave my cramped surroundings behind, I've been going on long walks around Lewes. I have a particularly good pair of shoes that were originally designed for postmen (if you look carefully, you can see 'Royal Mail' embossed on the side) and they enable me to stride around the town at a speed that burns off a few calories and gets the heart racing.The other day I explored the ruins of the Priory of St Pancras, which was built roughly 940 years ago: There's nothing like a good ruin to put things into perspective, whether it's a Norman priory in Sussex or a deserted office block in Detroit. Ruins are humbling, or should be. Last night, the Priory of St Pancras looked particularly beautiful as volunteers had lit over a thousand candles, all strategically placed either on the ground or in the nooks of the stone walls. It was quite magical.(My only reservation was over the decision to lay a double row of lights, as it looked like one of those makeshift landing strips that feature in war films. When, at one point, I heard the drone of a light aircraft, I was worried that its confused pilot was about to make a descent. But that aside, it was a magical evening.)As the sun set, a choir started singing Carmina Burana and I felt incredibly grateful that I lived in a town that did things like this. If my pokey, Victorian terraced house was the price that I had to pay for living in Lewes, it was probably one worth paying. Also, at a time when so many people around the world have been displaced from their homes, it seemed absurd to be complaining about something so self-indulgent and trivial.But when the car exhausts and builders' hammers get too much, I can faintly hear the quiet call of the garden gnomes whispering \"Shed, conservatory, en suite bathroom, study, parking space, large kitchen, guest bedroom...\" and a part of me weakens.P.S - In response to Joan's comment, I have a very short video clip of the choir, which I've added. I didn't bother trying to film anything in the dark, but I hope this captures something of the evening's magic. Oh, and did I add that it was all free?"},
{"title": "Unkindled", "date": "Saturday, September 05, 2015", "text": "My attempts to lead a well-ordered life have once again been defeated by animals. This time, I have a decomposing rat underneath the floor of my office and a hornets' nest in the building where I store my books. I'm not quite sure what to do, other than stay away until it gets colder.I shouldn't have to wait too long. The weather already feels distinctly autumnal and it can't be long before the hornets begin to feel sleepy and the rat has become a dried husk. At that point I'll start working again and hope that I can secure enough stock to make the business viable.Next week, I begin two years of driving my sons in opposite directions across the Sussex countryside to their respective schools. I'm not looking forward to it. Getting my older son out of the house will be a challenge in itself, without the added complication of rush hour traffic. I wish we had hover cars. For some reason, I've recently grown tired of reading novels on a Kindle and have returned to buying real books. I've no idea why.My younger son is delighted, as he has always been a staunch opponent of ebooks. I don't know why he took against the Kindle at such a young age, but my experience tallies with the anecdotal evidence of other parents, who have noticed how one sibling will prefer reading on a tablet device while the other will only accept traditional books. My son says that he finds it satisfying to look at all the books he's read and I know exactly what he means. Some of my favourite reads of the last few years - Of Human Bondage, South Riding and Clayhanger are conspicuous by their absence from my shelves and I'm tempted to order cheap copies for the bookcase. Have reports of the death of the book been greatly exagerrated? I've read articles claiming that the seeming inexorable rise in ebook sales is bottoming out, with only single digit growth in the US. It will be interesting to see what happens. I have been out a lot during the last few weeks, but very little of it would make interesting reading. I had intended to write a post about a new Bridget Riley exhibition, but sadly I had to leave after five minutes as the paintings were giving me a terrible headache. I'm not sure if that was her intention.Instead, here are a few photos from the last ten days: When things are less malodorous at work, I'll try and find some amusing bookish ephemera to post. In the meantime, expect more moody shots of clouds."},
{"title": "Yesterday's Today", "date": "Sunday, August 30, 2015", "text": "Yesterday morning, several people we knew stopped eating their Coco Pops when a disconcertingly familiar voice could be heard on Radio Four's 'Today' programme, talking about the late diagnosis of autism in children. It was my wife: The interview was the result of a new campaign by the National Austic Society, which is trying to improve the appallingly long delays in diagnosing Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). My wife was approached because our story was one of the worst examples that the NAS had come across. I was quite shocked by this. I know several people with severely autistic children and nothing we have experienced can compare to the ordeal they have gone through. However, I was missing the point, which was about how long parents have to wait for their child's condition to be recognised.In our son's case, a large part of his childhood has been lost thanks to the inexperience and prejudices of a few individuals in the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAHMS). In particular, I won't forget the following encounters:* Being told that my son's rages (which included kicking a hole in the wall of his bedroom) and obsessive compulsive behaviour was simply the result of 'sibling rivalry' - a fit of pique at the arrival of his baby brother.*The half-baked autism assessment where my son's understanding of metaphor would be tested with coloured cards: \"I haven't got the actual cards and these are just black and white photocopies, but the object in this card's meant to be red...\"*The helpful advice that if my wife and I stopped worrying about our son and started relaxing and enjoying ourselves more, he'd also become less anxious. This was given at a time when my son's OCD rituals for each room in the house were so bad, he would spend hours on the upstairs landing, not knowing where to go.*The person who said \"I can tell just by looking that your son doesn't have autism.\"*The individuals who recommended that we went on parenting courses or had family therapy, as our son's behaviour was clearly the result of something we were doing wrong.In fairness to CAHMS, I know that they are underfunded and have to deal with some truly horrific cases, many of which have a higher priority than our own. I should also add that some of the professionals we met were truly wonderful, particularly during the last three years. I just wish that they had been more on the ball in the early years, for all our sakes.If I suddenly found myself in a position of power, the first thing I would do would be to standardise the diagnostic criteria across the various health authorities, making the assessments more rigorous. I would also insist that all early years teachers had autism awareness training. Third, I would increase the CAHMS budget and recruit more nursing staff with autism training (I would rather have 25 nurses than 10 psychologists). Spending more on mental health in the early years will, I've no doubt, save a fortune in the long term.My wife found the interview mildly terrifying, but was delighted that autism expert Prof. Simon Baron-Cohen had agreed to take part. Our son is, thankfully, blissfully unaware that his story has now been heard by millions of people."},
{"title": "The Ghost in the Machine", "date": "Thursday, August 20, 2015", "text": "A few days ago I received an email containing some of the data from my MRI scan in July. I was just expecting a picture of a brain, but instead I received something far more human:Someone asked me what the zig-zaggy bits were. I explained that they enabled me to communicate telepathically with a man in New Zealand, called Colin. I'm not sure what's happened to the hair. Perhaps it's not magnetic enough.On a more sensible note, it's a rare privilege to be offered such an unsual perspective without having to endure the worry of a suspected illness. I thought I'd be repulsed by the physicality of seeing the ghost in the machine, but my brain seems to like looking at itself. It's a funny thing. I've been thinking a lot about the brain recently, as I have started playing the piano again after a break of 30 years and it's extraordinary how many pieces of music have come back to me - not just the notes, but also the fingering. All of that information, lying dormant in a cluster of neurons.The pieces I enjoy playing most are some arrangements by Bartok based on Slovakian folksongs. They're relatively simple pieces, written for children, but are a pleasure to play because they're quirky and unpredictable, with exotic harmonies. Here's a 51-second clip of one of them. Needless to say, this isn't me playing. My version would be lento:When not playing Bartok, I've been trying to get out as much as possible and make the most of what's left of the summer. Last week, I took my wife and sons out after dark to a remote car park in Ashdown Forest where, after checking that it wasn't full of people dogging, we watched the Perseid meteors light up the sky. The first two meteors were tiny little flashes and we ooohed and ahhhed politely, feeling slightly disappointed, then suddenly a bright ball of fire streaked across the sky, leaving a trail of smoke in its wake, followed by a faint smell of gunpowder. At this point, my younger son buried his head in my lap and said that he was worried about being blinded. I knew it was a mistake to let him watch The Day of the Triffids.Later in the week we drove to Beachy Head, to watch the Eastbourne Airshow. I'd never been to an airshow before and wasn't terribly impressed to see a solitary plane slowly ambling around Eastbourne. Neither were my boys, who complained that they were bored. After half an hour, I went off to some bushes near the cliff edge to answer the call of nature and quickly looked around to check that the coast was clear. Suddenly, I heard a roar and a Vulcan bomber appeared right in front of me, emerging from underneath the cliffs. Sadly, I wasn't holding my camera at the time:We had no idea that we were witnessing the Vulcan's final flight, but for many watching it must have been a bittersweet experience. The photo above doesn't do justice to the size and power of the Vulcan. Even my wife, who is the last person who would normally enjoy an airshow, thought that it was an incredible spectacle. In other news, my book shed has a new addition to its menagerie of animals:I found it wandering aimlessly at the bottom of a shelving unit. I think it might be a toadlet.A man at a Finnish academic library recently returned an order to me because of a \"possible microbial infection\". He'd bought the 70-year-old book, which had been advertised as being in fair to good condition, for £6. To me, it just looked like a book that had been read a few times, but was still in pretty good shape. What was he expecting for £6? Perhaps I should throw in a toad next time."},
{"title": "Walter Leigh - the Eric Ravilious of Music?", "date": "Friday, August 14, 2015", "text": "A few days ago I went to Dulwich to see the Eric Ravilious exhibition (which ends on August 31st) and was both delighted and appalled to see that it was packed with vistors. I partly blame James Russell, the exhibition's curator, for tirelessly promoting Ravilious's work and producing some gorgeous hardback books, but the other culprit must surely be the internet. Part of the appeal of Ravilious is, I think, the fact that he celebrates England in a manner that is free of bombast or sentimentality, finding beauty in the mundane and commonplace. It is an art that can only have been created by the generation who came of age after the First World War.As many will know, Ravilious's life came to a premature end in 1942, when a plane he was travelling in as a war artist went missing off the coast of Iceland, on September 2nd. Less well known is a death that took place ten weeks earlier, when a young composer called Walter Leigh was killed in action at Tobruk.Born in Wimbledon, exactly two years to the day after Ravilious, on June 22nd, Walter Leigh grew up in a middle class family and began having music tuition at the age of eight. His early years are something of a mystery, but thanks to this website, we know that when he was at Cambridge, Leigh decided to switch from studying English to Music.After Cambridge, Leigh travelled to Berlin and, like several of his contemporaries, studied with the German composer Hindemith. It was there that Leigh began to develop a style that mirrors Eric Ravilious in its clarity and restraint, eschewing melodrama in favour of a gentle, understated melancholy. Here is Walter Leigh's greatest work, the exquisite Concertino for Harpsichord and Strings:If you can't face hearing more than a couple of minutes, skip to 3:23 and try the sublime middle movement. Listening to this work is always a bittersweet experience, as I can't help wondering what Leigh would have gone on to write if he'd survived the War.Another gorgeous piece that I find quietly heart-rending is the first movement of Leigh's 'Music for Strings':But like Ravilious, Walter Leigh wasn't precious about his art and would happily write in a more populist style if the commission called for it. Walter Leigh died at the age of 37. Unlike Eric Ravilious, he didn't leave a huge body of work behind and a projected symphony never progressed beyond the stage of rough sketches. But the chamber, piano and orchestral works that exist show a composer of exceptional gifts who, had he lived, would have become a major figure in British musical life."},
{"title": "A Week in Instagram", "date": "Tuesday, August 04, 2015", "text": "I woke up this morning with a one pound coin and a fifty pence piece stuck to my back. I've no idea how they got there, but I'm not complaining. The last week has been spent trying to expose my older son to a daily dose of sunlight, so that his vitamin D levels improve. He already walks as if he has rickets, but I think that's just him. If I ask him to walk normally, he gets very cross.Our first trip took us to Ashdown Forest - the place that inspired the Winnie-the-Pooh stories. By sheer chance, we parked only a few minutes' walk from the memorial to A.A.Milne and E.H.Shephard, carefully placed in a setting that recalls this famous line:\"Wherever they go, and whatever happens to them on the way, in that enchanted place on the top of the forest, a  little boy and his Bear will always be playing.\"The forest appeared to be deserted and for a brief moment, it felt as if we had entered a lost idyll, but the discovery of a rather large bra hanging from a tree quickly changed the mood:Did the bra's owner have to leave in a hurry, or was she suffering from some form of post-coital amnesia? Sadly, I think I've got to the age where I'm more interested in unusual trees than abandoned underwear. I particularly liked this tree, which had a bark that reminded me of The Thing in the Fantastic Four:The following day I explored Birling Gap at low tide, negotiating my way across hundreds of rocks covered in sharp periwinkles. After ten minutes, I realised that I was alone and wondered why most people were content to huddle together on a small stretch of beach, rather than seek out a deserted cove. I walked along a wave cut platform, looking at the small rock pools that had formed in this transient, tidal environment, watching tiny wisps of fish nervously dart out of sight. As a boy, I could happily spend hours exploring the microcosm of a rock pool. As an adult, I find myself more preoccupied with thinking about what I should be feeling, and wondering why I'm not.I find that a remote, empty beach quickly induces a sense of timelessness, as if I am the last human left at the end of the world. Is that a bit potty? Sometimes the isolation can be therapeutic, providing a chance to see things in perspective without any distractions, but this time all I could think about was an annoying tune that had popped into my head: \"Didn't we have a lovely time, the day we went to Bangor...\" Maddening.On the way back, I took a rather average photo on my phone, which Instagram later transformed into something that vaguely resembles a magic lantern slide. As I said in an earlier post, I have become a huge fan of Instagram. If you have an account, you'll find me listed as phil._.b (the dots and underscore are vital). Every photo in this post is from Instagram, apart from the bra.I haven't quite worked out the Instagram etiquette yet, but I generally work on the rule that I'll show you mine if you show me yours. In contrast to the stark isolation of the beach, I enjoyed a visit to a local village fete, in a place called Glynde:Almost everything you could want was there: a Punch and Judy show, stalls selling bric a brac that would remain unsold, a tent with a tea urn and a selection of fruit cakes made by the ladies of the parish. Only the local vicar was missing, with the obligatory appeal to restore his organ. Glynde is an idyllic village, seemingly frozen in time. Many of the cottages are, I'm told, owned by a local aristocrat and rented out. This may strike many as an absurd anachronism, but the reality is a village of beautifully maintained properties rented at affordable prices. I think I'd rather have noblesse oblige than 'shareholder value'.My favourite building is the blacksmith's, which is still a working forge:Later that day, my wife and I went for dinner with some friends in Hove. As I walked across the station footbridge and looked below, my Instagram alarm button started ringing again:I liked the symmetry of the trains and felt pleased with the shot, but am I now going to start seeing Instagram opportunities everywhere? I blame my phone, which continues to exceed expectations. For example, when I saw a Ladybird resting on some berries yesterday, I assumed that a close-up would only be possible with a proper camera. Fortunately, the phone coped admirably:In the pre-smartphone era, I wouldn't have had a camera with me on a short walk around the outskirts of Lewes. But now that I have a decent phone and an Instagram account, I'm learning to look with fresh eyes at the familiar:This is an abandoned quarry. I love the contrast between the rocks and the primordial-looking ferns. It's a strange place and whenever I hear the swoop of wings in the distance, I almost expect to see a pterodactyl.This is a rather odd picture because it looks as if it has been heavily manipulated, digitally, but in fact I've barely altered it. The field in the background is Landport Bottom - a place populated by dog walkers and nervous sheep. It's hard to believe that history was made here, 751 years ago.From Landport Bottom, a wooded path leads to the top of an old chalk quarry. I never tire of the view of the Weald and the Ouse river, meandering into the distance:In the evening, teenagers come up here, light camp fires and drink copious amounts of beer. So far, none of them have tumbled over the cliff in the dark, but I expect that there have been some near misses. After doing so much walking, I will hopefully sleep soundly tonight. If I'm really lucky, I may wake up with another £1.50 stuck to my back."},

{"title": "I Give It a Year", "date": "Sunday, July 26, 2015", "text": "Every dog has its day and after almost nine years of blogging, I feel that this one is slowly limping towards its inevitable end. Perhaps the tenth anniversary would be a good stopping point. Not with a bang, but a whimper. This blog began as an idle experiment to relieve the tedium of being stuck in bed, while I was recovering from a particularly violent bout of food poisoning. It was called 'The Age of Uncertainty' because I had just entered my 40s and the job that I mostly loved had literally changed overnight into one I largely hated. I wasn't planning to make a habit of it. However, when Ms Baroque kindly commented on my first post, generously refraining from pointing out how banal it was, I couldn't quite get over the novelty that a complete stranger had read my words, thought about them and bothered to write a reply. It seemed quite wonderful.I think the blog really hit its stride when I worked for a company that provided me with a constant supply of old photograph albums, secondhand books and quirky ephemera from house clearances. I particularly enjoyed sifting through the fragments of lost lives, sharing the best of them. If the rest of the job had been as enjoyable, I might have stayed.Four years after becoming self-employed, the photos and letters are thin on the ground and I seem to have fewer things to say, perhaps because my time is largely taken up with family concerns that wouldn't make very interesting reading. When I do have an idea for a post, it's often accompanied by an awful sense of déjà vu.If I had more time, I might have written a post about the Roald Dahl Museum, which I visited a couple of weeks ago (the photo at the beginning of this post is of the wall of the church where Dahl's funeral took place), or of the discovery of an abandoned quarry in Lewes, hidden behind a thick undergrowth:But most of my mental energy is going into getting my ASD son used to being outside again. Last year his agoraphobia became so severe, he began to suffer from vitamin D deficiency. The lack of sunlight, exercise and human contact had a predictably debilitating effect and it had been a gargantuan task to reverse this decline, but at last, things are looking up:This photo, which my younger son created on Instagram, was taken yesterday afternoon during a visit to the South Downs. Recent trips out have followed a familiar pattern of a five minute walk, followed by a frantic request to go home. But yesterday we walked for over an hour and, to my amazement, were able to go for a pub lunch afterwards. Like a normal family!All of this has been achieved over time with a lot of help from professionals. There are no easy fixes and we are not going to make the mistake of thinking that the problem has been solved. It will always be an ongoing battle and when winter comes, we will have to be careful not to let my son's world shrink again.It's extraordinary how little we know about these conditions, except that there is a genetic factor. I have taken part in Simon Baron Cohen's autism test and I am less autistic than the average male, but I did suffer from what are now known as 'neurodevelopmental disorders' as a child, so when I heard that a team at Sussex University were looking for volunteers for a research project, I decided to volunteer.It's a decision I began to regret when, last Tuesday, my head was place in a vice-like grip and my brain was bombarded with a high-powered electro-magnetic field for an uncomfortably long time, but they seemed suitably appreciative afterwards and perhaps it may turn out to be one of the most useful things I've done in my life.And that's largely it. The days are spent going on short trips, usually taken between midday and three o'clock to ensure that my older son gets plenty of vitamin D. In the evenings, my wife and I enjoy our guilty pleasure - drinking Pimms and watching The Good Wife on Netflix. If all that sounds a little dull, I would agree. But after the last few years, dull is good."},
{"title": "The Ruination of London", "date": "Wednesday, July 15, 2015", "text": "I was going to write a blog post about what's happening to London, but Alain de Botton has summed up the problem far more eloquently than I ever could in this excellent short film:I don't agree with everything he says. There is a place for the occasional 'fun' building and the view from the Shard is one of the most exhilarating experiences I've had in recent years. But if developers have their way, that view will become an increasingly depressing one, as a great, historic city gradually becomes subsumed under a tidal wave of skyscrapers.I had hoped the the global recession would call a halt to this madness, but instead London has become more attractive than ever to investors, few of whom have an emotional investment in the wellbeing of the city. London has effectively become a high class hooker, flaunting its wares before a parade of wealthy clients. But I'm now in danger of writing the blog post that I said I wasn't going to write, so I'll stop now."},
{"title": "The Mild West", "date": "Sunday, July 12, 2015", "text": "I have just returned from the first family holiday we've had in three years. It lasted for two days, which was quite enough for everyone. It seems extraordinary that my childhood holidays were always a fortnight long. One of my earliest memories is of a disastrous stay in rural Wales, where my parents had booked bed and breakfast on a remote farm. It rained for the entire two weeks and the holiday felt more like penal servitude. The farm's owners rarely spoke English and regarded our presence as a necessary evil, although when the weather was particularly bad, we were once invited to watch an episode of 'The Virginian' with them.  We never went back. The following year, we began the first of many successful holidays at a caravan site in Devon, where I befriended two girls and their younger brother. We got along so well, our parents decided to synchronise their holidays. I have many happy memories of Enid Blyton-style adventures involving deserted cottages, poachers and secret dens. When the holiday began, the two weeks ahead felt like an eternity and we gladly turned our backs on the dreary, monochrome existence of our real lives. Local landmarks became old friends: a telephone box, a garage with a blue door, a wonky road sign and prehistoric tumulus in the distance. As we approached the caravan site after a day out, my mother would say \"We're home.\"The long summer holiday was a gift I wanted to give to my children. It never occured to me that the prospect of spending two weeks in an idyllic setting, exploring the countryside and beaches, would be anyone's idea of hell. However, children on the autistic spectrum hate a break in their routine.When I broached the subject of a holiday with my son, I felt as if I was brokering a deal as challenging as the Greek debt repayment. In the end, we agreed that two nights would be acceptable as long as the hotel had wifi and wasn't further than 120 miles away.It was a plus point that we were returning to Dorset, as my son would know what to expect. I didn't mention that the hotel was 800-years-old, as that would probably be a bad thing in his book.Golden Cap, the second highest point on the south coast of EnglandDorset was as pretty as I remembered it, but many of the traditional family-run shops have been replaced with chi chi cafes, artisan bakeries and places selling rather poorly-executed paintings. It looks as if the London diaspora has reached Dorset and the rhotic r has been replaced by the 'flat white'. If I had my way, I'd reintroduce smocks and pitchforks, with penalties for anyone who didn't say their rrrs and oiz properly.A strange rock formation that vaguely resembles a porpoise's headLyme Regis harbourOverall, the holiday was a success. There were a few wobbles and I felt sorry for my younger son when a fossiling trip came to an abrupt end, but most of the time we managed to achieve something that faintly resembled a normal family holiday. When we returned home, our older son said that he would like to do it again.P.S. I've become a big fan of Instagram recently, so here are a few pictures from the trip:"},
{"title": "Lord of the Dance", "date": "Saturday, July 04, 2015", "text": "Some time ago I mentioned the Lewes Dancing Man - a gentleman who is something of a local celebrity. If you look him up on YouTube, there are several videos that show the full majesty of his talents.I first came across him in a pub, ten years ago. To begin with, I barely noticed the man in his 50s, sitting alone at a nearby table, staring into a pint of Harvey's. Then someone selected a Rolling Stones song on the jukebox and he was up, performing a highly individual dance routine.I thought the Lewes Dancing Man was unique, but this morning I discovered a new pretender to the throne:The dance moves are quite similar (albeit with a lot less legwork), which suggests that LDMII is either an understudy to the original or that this is how we'd all dance if we weren't worried about looking silly. The band - an excellent group of young men called the Ouse Valley Collective - were suitably bemused.I would rather walk through a building on fire than dance in public and looked at the new Lewes Dancing Man with more than a little envy, as he seemed so unihibited. My wife suggested that this was because he was mentally ill. I wasn't entirely convinced.But even if the new LDM does have a few 'issues', give me a madman any day over some of the clinically sane people who have appeared in the news recently for various reasons If only they'd embraced their inner Lewes Dancing Man, we might all be better off."},
{"title": "An Odd Day Out", "date": "Saturday, June 13, 2015", "text": "There is a splendid museum in a place called Amberley that contains an eclectic collection centred around Britain's industrial and rural heritage. If you're interested in Edwardian light bulbs, brick making or 1930s fire engines, I can thoroughly recommend it. I'm not, but I still loved it.On busy days, dozens of odd-looking families visit the museum, all armed with tupperware packed lunches and SLR cameras. Sometimes I hear snatches of conversations, usually conducted in a slightly nasal accent: \"Of course these were the last D759s to be manufactured in Northampton, but the D80 was basically the same engine...\"Many of the exhibits are really quite boring, but in a sense that is part of their appeal.The machines that operated the hidden infrastructure of daily life - telephone exchanges and power station control panels - have an unexpected beauty about them and it's hard not to feel impressed by their complexity and elegance. Artists have paid homage to the machine age, but in the end it is the machines themselves that have ended up becoming works of art in their own right.I may be a philistine, but I would rather look at a display of antique telephones than a gallery of Greco-Roman sculptures, with their uniform blank expressions and unfeasibly small genitalia. However, I'm not just there for the knobs and dials. On quieter days, the place becomes more like a post-apocalyptic theme park, almost completely deserted, full of rusting, abandoned machines and makeshift settlements:This is a camp for itenerant bodgers, making chair parts from unseasoned wood, usually for a pittance. The last bodger bodged over 50 years ago, but the craft is being revived by a small group of devotees.The shelter looks as if it could belong to the future as much as the past.With a little tweaking, the whole place could be relaunched as a Walking Dead-related theme park. It would be more exciting than the current exhibition devoted to electricity substations (although I suspect that the school visits would dry up).I was rather taken with the makeshift camps and imagined making a rabbit stew on a chilly autumn day, listening out for the ominous crack of a twig, but my post-apocalyptic fantasies were bought to an abrupt end by the appearance of some beautiful damsel flies. I think some of them may have been mating. It's hard to tell.Amberley Museum is set in some beautiful surroundings, but the idyllic setting belies the fact that the place once looked like a poor man's Mordor, with smoke bellowing out of the local lime kilns. Limestone was quarried from these cliffs and burned with coal to make lime, which was then used to make the acidic soil of other counties more fertile. The traces of a railway line next to the kilns can still be seen, compounding the sense of dereliction. However, I'd be doing Amberley Museum a disservice if I over-egged the post-apocalyptic pudding.The museum should appeal to anyone who is even vaguely interested in social history and although some of its galleries are a bit on the 'specialist' side, there are others that are remarkably evocative.I loved this reconstruction of an early 20th century office, where nobody would have been required to be a \"team player\" or feel \"enthusiastic\" (whatever happened to diligence, honesty and punctuality?).I also enjoyed being alone in this Southdown Buses booking office, below, trying to picture myself in the 1930s. If I'd been 10 years old, I would have had no problem losing myself in a fantasy about being a gentleman detective, but sadly I've lost the imagination I once took for granted.Amberley Museum has a particularly good Science Museum-esque electricity gallery, with hands-on displays to entertain younger visitors and a collection of household appliances to jog the memories of older ones:  This prewar electric bar fire is remarkably versatile. Not only can you use it to make toast, but it also heats up a copper kettle for a nice cup of tea. It never caught on. I suppose some health and safety killjoy pointed out that electricity and water weren't a good combination. Either that, or someone came a cropper as they were preparing their afternoon tea.I recognised several things from my past: a spin dryer, a television with three channel buttons, an old radio with evocative names like Athlone, Moscow and Paris on the dial and, more suprisingly, a late 90s Nokia mobile phone. Each one transported me back to a particular time and place.One day, 18 years ago, I left work and got in my car, placing a carrier bag in the passenger seat. After a minute of seraching for the right tape to listen to on the journey home, I became aware of a tiny voice emanating from the carrier bag. It was saying \"Hello? Hello?\"I tried to reconcile the reality of the voice with the impossibility of anyone or anything being inside the bag. Was I going mad? I didn't feel mad, but I suppose the truly insane rarely do. The voice continued: \"Can you hear me?\"It was my wife's voice. Somehow, she had been shrunk down to the size of a toy soldier. There was no other explanation.At no point did I ever consider that I might have accidentally phoned my wife on my new Nokia phone. I'd never owned a mobile phone before and was unaware that it could do this. I felt very silly afterwards and forgot all about it until I saw the phone again. It looked so big. But I digress. To return to the point, Amberley is a gem of a museum, thoroughly eccentric and quite unlike anywhere else I have been, with the added bonus of being set in beautiful surroundings. Even the dullest displays had their own strange appeal and I enjoyed the feeling of being immersed in a quieter, bygone world. In an age when so many places have been fully 'monetized', with overpriced chi chi cafes and movie franchise-related displays, it's a pleasant surprise to find somewhere that isn't afraid to be boring. Long may it remain that way."},
{"title": "Heaven in a Wild Flower", "date": "Monday, June 08, 2015", "text": "I seem to be exiled in Sussex at the moment, but I can think of worse places to be. Like the main character in the Stanley Middleton novel I've just read, I'm finding pleasure in small things: a hedgerow in blossom, a hatched bird's egg, a flint wall covered in lichen, a Victorian letter box, a fish-shaped weather vane...I hadn't read Stanley Middleton before. I first knew him as the author whose name I didn't recognise on a list of Booker Prize winners (he shared the prize with Nadine Gordimer in 1973). His novels were usually conspicuous by their absence from bookshop shelves.Middleton's 'Necessary Ends' is a novel about an old man by an old man and deals with death, regret and loneliness in a way that is never mawkish or sentimental, eschewing melodrama in favour of an almost forensic realism.A hostile critic might complain that the end result of this realism is a novel in which nothing happens. That would be unfair. In one scene a pub lunch is arranged, in another chocolate biscuits are served on a small plate. There is even an episode that involves the misuse of a front lawn.But I'm being flippant about what is actually an exquisite, beautifully observed novel, written with great warmth and humanity. And once you realise that the author isn't going to resort to any of the predictable plot devices for a novel about an octogenarian - the heart attack, the violent burglary, the estranged child - you're left with a story in which even the most trivial events are loaded with significance.In its quiet, understated way, 'Necessary Ends' has the same dramatic and redemptive qualities as any novel I could mention, but they are more subtle and nebulous. A pub lunch that might seem mundane to most of us becomes a transfigurative event and is quietly uplifting, suggesting that we can be surprised by joy at any age.Which brings me back to the theme of finding pleasure in the familiar, or as Blake put it, heaven in a wild flower. Here are a few photos from the last week: But for me, the best picture is the one below: my older son, running along the local beach for the first time in two years, laughing and playing with his brother. Thanks to a number of people, things are at last changing for the better."},
{"title": "Ruminations", "date": "Friday, May 29, 2015", "text": "A few weeks ago I went to a reunion of ex-Ottakar's booksellers and met people I hadn't seen for nine years. For a few hours, it felt as if I'd woken up from a bad dream and that we were all back together again. To add to the feeling of discombobulation, nobody appeared to have aged, even slightly. It was a bittersweet evening. It was lovely to see people that I'd once felt a genuine affection for, but it also made me sad that I'd lost an enjoyable and rewarding career. Working alone in a remote barn, for a slowly diminishing income, isn't what I envisaged I'd be doing at this age. However, I'm not alone. Most of my contemporaries have either experienced 'burn-out' or been made redundant. The world of work is becoming increasingly cut-throat and it's hard to compete with someone who is half your age, full of enthusiasm and willing to accept a lower salary.Of course, male employees can always crack open the Just For Men, go to a gym and try and seem a little bit crazy, but they'll still come across as embarrasing dads having a midlife crisis. It's an unforgiving world out there.A friend of mine complains that there is nobody in her office over the age of 35. Where have all the middle aged people gone? I suspect that like me, quite a few of them are eking out an existence, some more comfortably than others, trying to juggle the demands of young children and/or elderly parents. Next September, my son will hopefully be starting at a new, specialist school, which could be the making of him. I will be taking and collecting him by car every schoolday for the best part of two years, so any work I do will have to fit around that schedule.At the end of it, my son will hopefully be independent enough to make his own way to appointments and lessons. Legally, he will be an adult and in theory, I'll be free to find a proper job. But what will I do?Men of my age aren't exactly hot property in the jobs market.Self-employment can be a godsend if you have a child with 'special needs'. I've lost count of the number of meetings I've had to drive to, or the hours that have been spent coaxing my son back into the outside world. But the erratic income and social isolation can be debilitating.After sitting alone in a shed for a whole day, I don't come home brimming with energy and my limited repertoire of work-related anecdotes usually involve birds, rodents or invertebrates. I feel bored by myself.For my own sanity, I need to find something else, even if it's just a succession of temporary or part-time jobs. I can't imagine never working with anyone again. But, of course, there are also positives to being self-employed. The other afternoon, when I ran out of work, I was able to come home early and go for a walk with my younger son. We stopped here and for the first time in years, I lay on the grass and watched the clouds merging into each other:The whole afternoon cost nothing and gave us both more pleasure than a visit to any tourist attraction. My son started to tell me about all of the things that were on his mind (most of them involved Lego) and for a while, I felt like a half-decent father. So I think that answer is to carry on as I am for two years, then look for a part-time job that doesn't involve wearing a green uniform or short trousers. But what, how and where? That is the question."},
{"title": "Man the Decks", "date": "Monday, May 25, 2015", "text": "It's been a disappointingly cool May, but I've grown to like the soft, pastel colours and muted shadows that grey skies produce. Even mundane objects like this Victorian flint and brick wall can seem a thing of beauty. I'd probably feel differently if I lived in somewhere like Croydon, where overcast skies only serve to accentuate the drabness of concrete office blocks and municipal car parks. But in the South Downs, a grey sky looks like an Eric Ravilious watercolour.My book business is going through a rather quiet period at the moment, so I've taken the opportunity to transform our garden from a toxic, post-apocalyptic wasteland into something that looks vaguely respectable, with decking, pot plants and freshly-painted walls. The decking was done by a retired man, who proudly told us that he'd learned his carpentry skills at a borstal. According to his son, he should be dead, having been electrocuted twice, surviving a heart attack in his 50s and falling off a number of buildings.He also has a metal plate in his leg.\"It's his own fault,\" the son explained. \"He's never been one to worry about health and safety. He's got this daft idea that it's safer to walk on a roof barefoot.\"On one occasion, the son was working with his father on a roofing job when he heard him crying out and sliding down the tiles. Suddenly, the sliding stopped.\"It's all right,\" the father yelled, \"My foot got stopped by the top of the ladder. I'm okay now...wooaahhh...\"At this point, the ladder began to fall backwards and the father was catapulted through the air.He escaped with barely a scratch.Fortunately, the cavalier attitude had clearly mellowed over the years and he worked carefully and conscientiously, producing a wonderful result. It was inspiring to watch a man who was 20 years older make light work of such a demanding job. What was his secret?I decided to be brave and ask him how he kept so young: \"So what's your secret then?\"His face lit up. He slowly turned to me and said \"That would be lovely. White, no sugar please.\""},
{"title": "Flatford to Clacton (or From Hay Wain to Hey Wayne)", "date": "Thursday, May 14, 2015", "text": "Why is 'The Hay Wain' so popular in Britain? There are better and more interesting paintings, but, for some reason, Constable's famous scene used to be more common in suburban homes than dry rot.I once went to a house that had two 'Hay Wains' - a large one in the living room and a smaller one in the hall (but not a single book, sadly).They were owned by a plumber called Frank, who lived in a grim, terraced council house on one of England's roughest estates. Whether Frank particularly liked the scene or had simply bought a job lot, I don't know, but I suspect that many people responded to the depiction of a lost rural idyll. Until today, I'd always assumed that the scene in 'The Hay Wain' was now consigned to oblivion, replaced by a housing estate or supermarket car park, but I was wrong. The lost rural idyll still exists in a place called Flatford. This is the house that Constable painted, almost 200 years ago:It's probably less idyllic in the height of the tourist season, when crowds of people in garish leisurewear amble round the grounds, but yesterday I barely saw a soul:After taking a wrong turn, I went for an unintentionally long walk and found myself in a sort of paradise, with butterflies flittering in and out of the cow parsley and nettles. Away from the sounds of traffic and other human activities, I became aware of just how loud nature is:  It was particularly noisy, as I had inadvertently stumbled onto a private bird sanctuary and was probably ruining things for anyone who was sitting in the 'hide' that I could see, 100 yards away. I didn't want to be angrily pursued by someone called Colin, so I decided to make a break for it. On the way back, I found something rather disturbing - the remains of a dead rabbit, hanging from the branch of a tree. Suddenly, I could almost hear the banjos.By the time I returned to Flatford Mill, the coach parties were arriving. One man in his 60s was dressed like a Californian surfer, with a pyschedelic t-shirt that said Venice Beach. I thought he might a Hunter S Thompson figure, but then he opened his mouth and said \"I'm just popping in the gift shop, Val, to see if they do that nice fudge.\"I should have driven home, but, like a moth to the flame, I couldn't resist the temptation to make a diversion to Clacton-on-Sea - the only place in Britain to elect a UKIP member of Parliament (if you live in the USA, UKIP are similar to the 'Tea Party'). But first, I began with Jaywick which, in addition to sounding like an air freshener, is the poorest place in England:With housing that is only marginally better than the favelas of Rio de Janiero, Jaywick feels as if it has been abandoned and disowned by the rest of the UK. It began promisingly enough in the 1930s as a holiday resort for working-class Londoners, with plots of reclaimed salt marshes being sold for as little as £25. The cheap, jerry-built houses were never designed for year-round use, but a postwar housing shortage saw many people make Jaywick their permanent home, even though the developer had failed to put in some of the most basic infrastuctures. Today, you can buy a one-bedroom bungalow in Jaywick for £25,000. On average, 15% of the UK population receive social benefits. According to the Guardian, the figure in Jaywick is 62%. I certainly don't think I've been anywhere in England where the residents look so visibly poor or unwell - a tragic irony, given the original conception of Jaywick as a place where people could enjoy the healthy, outdoor life.Apparently, the local council has tied to bulldoze the worst parts of Jaywick on more than one occasion, but the residents have always resisted. Beyond the poor housing and conspicuous poverty, there is a community spirit and fierce sense of independence. Jaywick will not be moved.Unfortunately, in addition to being the poorest place in England, it is also one of the most flood-prone, so the North Sea will probably succeed where the authorities have failed. Two miles along the coast, Clacton-on-Sea holds the accolade of being the second most deprived seaside resort in Britain, but compared to Jaywick it is the Côte d’Azur:Like Margate, it was a popular resort for working-class Londoners. Today, you'll probably find more Cockneys living in Clacton than within the sound of Bow Bells and the souvenirs, like the rhyming-slang tea towel below, cater for a local clientele as much as the daytrippers:My Cockney grandfather once worked as a labourer on the London Underground and, during a careless moment, fell onto a live rail and received serious burns. Paid sick leave wasn't an option in those days, so he decided to take his two weeks' annual leave and get treatment at Clacton-on-Sea, so that his wife and children could at least have a holiday.It seems a poor way to treat a man who was gassed in the trenches.The resort was packed in those days, as trainloads of people from London's East End filled the beaches:Today, Clacton has been largely usurped by sunnier climes and the holidaymakers have been replaced by the retired and unemployed. The popularity of UKIP probably reflects the feelings of those who feel that they have been left behind. On the pier, the funfair attractions were all mothballed and the only people I saw were a woman of 70, dolled-up like Olivia Newton John in Grease, with tight leather trousers and heavy make-up, clinging on to the arm of a man with faded tattoos.I left the funfair behind and walked towards the end of the pier. Two very elderly women hobbled past me and I heard a brief snatch of their converstion:\"She said she was becomin' a lesbian, but now she's decided not to...\"Next to the pier, a small building offered 'Tattoo's', but there was also a glass booth that offered temporary ones. I was very tempted to play a joke on my wife by coming home with something inappropriate on my arm, like Justin Bieber. But I've read too many stories of tattoos going horribly wrong, so I decided to play safe.For some odd reason, I had to buy my parking ticket in a bookshop and the moment I opened the door, I was transformed back to the 1970s. What is it about the small, old-fashioned independents that give them such a distinctive aroma of sweet decay? A lack of fresh air and a surfeit of old stock, perhaps, but the smell evoked happy memories of choosing the latest Enid Blyton.A woman slowly wrote out a chitty for me. I wanted to tell her that I used to be a bookseller too.For those who can survive for more than a day without a contemporary art gallery or artisan bakery, Clacton has its charms. The seafront is pleasant and there is a sandy, sheltered beach where small children can bathe safely with being dragged out to sea by any riptides. If you prefer shingle beaches and campervan-driving hipsters, then head north to Suffolk.I'll be sticking with Clacton. If it's good enough for my grandfather, it's good enough for me."},

{"title": "Spring in Oxford", "date": "Sunday, March 22, 2015", "text": "Today I went to Oxford on a whim, hoping that the city of dreaming spires would inspire my son to work a little harder. Sadly, I didn't realise that when the Welcome to Oxford sign appeared, we would be confronted with several miles of ring roads, light industry and shoddy housing estates. Brideshead Revisted was never like this.But enventually we reached the real city and it more than lived up to our expectations. We began in this Saxon church tower, built in 1040:As we climbed the steps, we could hear the hungry cries of baby pigeons, accompanied by the sublime singing of a young male student. The tower was reassuringly solid, with walls that were three feet thick. When we reached the top, we had a good view of the city:I used all my guile to get my son enthused about Oxford:\"This is where they filmed some of the Harry Potter films...Do you remember that episode of Doctor Who when the young Amy was in that museum?\" He nodded politely. Then I casually remarked that the windows looked into the student bedrooms and my son suddenly lit up:\"Really? Oh my! I'd like to go here. Do you have to be very rich?\"The conversation continued. \"Dad, why didn't you go to university here?\" I opted for the simple answer, deciding to leave out the possibility that I might not have been clever enough:\"I didn't work hard enough and I didn't love the subjects I studied. I wanted to do music, but I'd started too late to catch up. Whatever you do, do something you love and then it won't feel like hard work.\"\"Which famous people have been to Oxford?\" There were so many, I didn't know where to start. For some reason, Kris Kristofferson sprang to mind - he went to Merton - but that name would mean nothing to my son. I had to think of someone that children liked: \"You know the man who plays Mr Bean...\"The trouble with places like Oxford is that they offer a sensory overload. You wander around like an idiot, gawping with wonder, taking photographs of interesting bricks. It's not the linear square mileage that's the problem, but the temporal area - 900 years of history, compressed into a relatively small space, like the material inside a black hole.I haven't even got to grips with Lewes yet. How long would I have to live in Oxford before I began to vaguely make sense of it? I looked at the students and envied them, but then remembered that a friend's daughter studied here a few years ago. Naturally bright, she had sailed through every exam at school, but met her match at Oxford. After years of achieving top grades with very little effort, the punishing schedule of essays and reading lists came as a shock. She graduated, but seemed scarred by the experince.However, it must be a very grounding experience to be part of a tradition that is almost a thousand years old, literally following in the footsteps of figures like Dr Johnson, John Donne and Erasmus.In the photo below, the white house once belonged to Edmund Halley, of comet fame. I saw someone go in the front door and felt a momentary pang of envy. I took this photo through the railings of a fence. It's a secret garden: Et in arcadia ego, which is the title of the first chapter of Brideshead Revisited. It looks like the perfect place for a picnic involving plovers eggs and a reading of The Waste Land. This is the dining hall of Trinity College. Just in front of the mantlepiece, there is a large tomato ketchup dispenser. The seats have seen better days.I watched a group of students sitting on a lawn, having an animated conversation and wondered what my son made of it all.I hadn't brought him here to instill a burning desire to become an Oxbridge student. I simply wanted my son to be aware that he had choices, and that learning can become more interesting as you get older. I think he got the message."},

The brush with death came when a tonne of books nearly fell off the back of a lorry, on top of me. The lorry driver glowered: \"It's the tailgate that's making 'em wobble. They still 'aven't repaired it. What's in these boxes anyway?\" I made sure that I moved well back and watched as the pallet of boxes slowly descended, then inserted my trolley wheels underneath the wooden slats of the pallet and began pulling (oh, the glamour of bookselling!). If you've ever pulled a tonne of books along potholed, muddy ground, you'll know that it does odd things to the internal organs.At one point my pallet got stuck in the mud and I had a momentary existential crisis, reflecting on the chain of events that had led me to this point in time, but my reverie was rudely interrupted by the sound of one of my bookshelves collapsing:I've had better days.Fortunately, a kindly angel had invited Mrs Steerforth and I to a literary event that evening, so the day ended on a high.'The Books That Built Me' is the brainchild of Helen Brocklebank, a former director at Harper's Bazaar (also known to many as the blogger Mrs Trefusis) who now hosts a literary salon at the Cafe Royal, inviting writers to discuss the books that influenced them when they were young. It is a much more interesting approach than simply asking authors about their favourite books, as there is far more scope for self-revelation.Last night's writer, Andrew O'Hagan, was the perfect guest, blessed with a mercurial intellect and quick wit that never flagged. I particularly enjoyed his anecdotes about being a bookish cuckoo in the nest of a working-class Glasgow family. After what felt like half an hour, I was surprised to see that he'd been talking for an hour and 20 minutes. But the success of the evening was also thanks to Helen Brocklebank's skill as a host, unobtrusively moving the conversation forward, making intelligent, perceptive comments that clearly pleased Andrew O'Hagan. Helen had obviously done her research for the evening, but seemed equally at home when the conversation went completely off topic.The quality of the discussion was far better than a certain book programme that will remain nameless and it is surely only a matter of time before an enlightened broadcaster realises the potential of The Books That Built Me.In the meantime, if you can get to London for an evening, I would strongly recommend booking a ticket. I'll see you there."},
{"title": "Dark Age - Ishiguro's The Buried Giant", "date": "Thursday, March 12, 2015", "text": "TheTrainline.com offers a wide range of railway tickets, butthere is one that I think they should add to their selection: the Ishiguro.Buyan Ishiguro ticket and your destination will be clearly stated, but somehowyou’ll never quite get there. Instead, you’ll have enigmatic conversations withstrangers, leave the train halfway through the journey and find yourself in anunknown town that feels disconcertingly familiar. Eventually you’ll realisethat you grew up there, but had forgotten until now.Of course, I’m thinking of The Unconsoled – Kazuo Ishiguro’s maddening but wonderfulmasterpiece, the fictional equivalent of a waking dream (as one person astutelyobserved, it is we, the readers, who are the unconsoled). His new novel, TheBuried Giant, takes the reader into similar territory, exploring themes ofmemory and identity, but this time the narrative takes place in apost-Arthurian Britain.In true Ishiguro fashion, The Buried Giant is not what it initially seems. Itis set in the past but isn’t a historical novel. It contains ogres and pixies, plus a cameo appearance from Sir Gawain, but doesn't belong in the fantasy genre either. Indeed, it's much easier to say what it isn't rather than what it is.The narrative begins with an elderly Briton couple – Axl and Beatrice - who havebeen afflicted with a malaise that has clouded their memories and sense ofidentity. At first, I thought I’d spotted an allusion to Alzheimer’s, but inThe Buried Giant, young and old alike are affected by the ‘mist’.Believing that they have been mistreated by their neighbours,Axl and Beatrice decide to journey to their son’s village, but only have thevaguest idea of where he lives or when they last saw him.  In spite of the ogres, the nearest this novel ever gets to fantasy fiction isthat there is a vague, half-hearted quest, an occasional use of swords and ageriatric dragon. However, fans of Robert Jordan and David Eddings would, I suspect,be nonplussed.What is The Buried Giant about? God only knows. But part of the pleasure ofreading Ishiguro is that his writing works like poetry, speaking to thesubconscious. We may feel baffled by the narrative, but we can also feel astrong sense of empathy with the characters, who struggle to make sense of whatis happening to them.I was listening to Nielsen's 5th Symphony the other day - a work I've loved for over 30 years. It is a deeply profound piece of music, but I wouldn't even try to tell you what it was about, although on some level I feel I know. It would seem absurd to ask what a symphony was 'about' and yet we feel that it's perfectly reasonably to always ask that question of a novel.  If I had to put my cards on the table, I’d describe it as a story about memory andloss – the pain of forgetting and the fear of the price that must be paid for remembering. The phrase 'magical realism' has been used, but the contrast between the author's deadpan style and the bizarre events of the narrative make this more a 'realistic magic'. Does that make sense?The medieval saga-like setting and mythological elements are merely incidentalto a novel that is, ultimately, a meditation on the human condition and the mythologies we build around ourselves. However, like an Ishiguro character, I may be completely onthe wrong track. I have avoided reading any reviews or author interviews sothat my response wouldn’t be clouded by the reactions of others.Overall, I enjoyed several things about the book. I particularly liked theevocative descriptions of the often desolate landscape. I was also touched by therelationship between Axl and Beartrice, whose strong love contrasted with their physical fragility. But most of all, I admired Ishiguro’sbald, understated prose, which managed to say so little and so much at the sametime.I wasn’t completely convinced by the decision to included short chaptersnarrated by Sir Gawain and also found some of the characters’ reminiscences aslightly tedious digression, but these are minor quibbles. The word ‘haunting’ is overused in reviews, but it is apposite for Ishiguro’selusive, spectral fiction. It is nearly 20 years since I read The Unconsoled,but I remember it more clearly than some books I read last year. I suspect thatThe Buried Giant will also get under my skin and on sleepless nights, I’llimagine myself huddled in the ruins of a Roman villa, surrounded by wet fernsand nettles, seeking refuge from a winter storm."},
{"title": "The Fifties Home", "date": "Wednesday, March 11, 2015", "text": "I read recently about a man who has converted his house so that every item, down to the smallest cup, is authentically 1950s. His three concessions to modernity - a flat screen television, fast-boiling kettle and a microwave - are discretely hidden away. The home has been described as a 'time capsule'.But is it? Wouldn't the real 1950s home consist of an eclectic mix of furniture and styles - things that been handed down or patched-up? I don't know, but I do remember that my parents' 1960s home was a mixture of 1950s decor and grim, prewar furniture, all of which clashed horribly. Giving their house a 'contemporary makeover' wasn't an option.But by the early 70s, my parents had become so sick of the 50s look, they covered their kitchen walls in a hideous, self-adhesive vinyl material called Fablon and painted the furniture orange. It was as good as it sounds.As a result of my upbringing, I've always been quite hostile to 1950s design, associating it with poverty and austerity. But when I found a 1957 book called the 'Home Handyman' recently, I decided to try and be more open minded. I've added the original captions:\"A Brianco occasional table made from sheets of wood and screw-on legs.\"I remember having a similar table, which my parents kept until the late 1980s. The screw-on legs ensured that the table was always structurally unsound and any attempts to have a 'posh tea' for visitors was undermined by wobbling cups that sloshed tea everywhere. Not a design classic.\"Against the plain walls and carpet this boldly striped sofa becomes the focal point of the room.\"I was slightly distracted by the cheap-looking fence outside, but I agree that the sofa is a focal point. Just not in a good way.\"When using bold designs for curtains and cushions it is advisable to set them off against plain coverings on sofas and chairs.\"I won't take issue with that, but I would question having a collection of dead butterflies displayed on the walls:\"Plastic tiles make ideal floor coverings for places where water is likely to be splashed about...\"Before I worried about the floor, I'd do something about the walls:\"A multi-coloured striped towel lends gaiety to the bathroom and fits in with any colour scheme.\"Really?\"The dark piping on the cushions is all that is needed to make an effective contrast.\"I quite like this room, but I don't think the \"dark piping\" was a deciding factor.\"Loose covers add charm to rooms of character. The materials should harmonize with the atmosphere of the room.\"This room, with its mixture of traditional furnishings, is probably more authentically 1950s than many of the rooms shown above. The chintz look is very unpopular today but my parents loved it and bought some rather striking nylon seat covers with a bright, floral design. I think I gradually unravelled them while watching the Six Million Dollar Man. In conclusion, this book didn't win me over and I'd baulk at the prospect of living in a 1950s home. But although I may not appreciate the interiors of the 50s, I think the graphic design of that decade is much more appealing: Whatever happened to Murphy?"},
{"title": "Long Distance", "date": "Thursday, February 26, 2015", "text": "The beginning of Steven Spielberg's best film, Duel, captures the magic of driving in America. I like the process of transformation, from driving along a busy 12-lane freeway, with dozens of radio stations to choose from, to finding yourself alone, on a deserted two-lane stretch of road, with only a crackling Christian channel for company, broadcasting a melodrama about an alcoholic adulterer who finds Jesus. A sign announces that Davis City is five miles ahead and you feel a wave of excitement, as if the promised land is around the corner. It doesn't matter that when you reach Davis City, it takes 15 seconds to travel from one end to the other. The pleasure is in the anticipation.Sadly, Great Britain's motorways don't offer quite the same excitement: There will always be three or four lanes and the view will nearly always be the same . You may feel a slight frisson as BBC Radio Warwickshire's diminishing signal segues into a stronger one from Radio Leicester. I can't say I did.I had to make a 400-mile round trip yesterday, along a purgatorial stretch of motoway that seemed to be designed to sap the human spirit. At one point I stopped at a service station, hoping to restore my equilibrium. That was a mistake.Where was I? I still don't know. Everything was identical to another service station I went to last week. Working men in hi-vis jackets huddled around the counter of Greggs Bakery, whilst middle management types in shiny suits hooked into the free wifi in Costa Coffe and checked their emails. The design of the service station aimed at a reassuring uniformity, presenting the visitor with familiar brands. There was no sense of being anywhere. Later, I stopped at Newport Pagnell and went across this walkway. Most of the windows had been frosted, but a couple of clear panes gave a view of cars and lorries hurtling past underneath. The movement and noise beneath me contrasted with the curious stillness of the bridge. Further north, I noticed that the Waitrose in another service station was identical to the one at Newport Pagnell, right down to the three boxes of Lindt chocolate bunnies to the left of the till. It reminded me of a question that our philosophy lecturer asked us:\"If I remove my friend's Ford Cortina and replace it with one that's identical in every minute detail to the point where my friend has no idea that his car has been switched, is it the same car?\"At the time, we all groaned and said no, of course not. What a silly question. But actually it was a sly introduction to epistemology, forcing us to confront the truth that reality was simply what we thought we knew. Was I in the same Waitrose?But then I noticed that the sales assistant had a slightly different accent and was a little friendlier. It was like unlocking your Cortina and finding furry dice that weren't there before.After hours of driving, I reached my destination. The prospect of having to drive home wasn't particularly appealling. Perhaps I could just live here, I thought, as I drove past rows of semi-detached houses. I quickly spotted my new local shop, which had three men drinking cans of lager outside.Whenever I go anywhere, I wonder what it would be like to have a life there. If I'd made different decisions when I was young, where would I be now? More successful, or drinking lager outside a corner shop in the north? Happier or sadder? It's tantalising to think how many paths are open to us.My meeting lasted for five minutes. He was a nice chap and we both agreed that we'd play it by ear. There wasn't much more to say."},
{"title": "The Long Man", "date": "Saturday, February 21, 2015", "text": "This morning began normally enough. My wife refused to get up until she'd read another chapter of the new Anne Tyler novel. I fiddled around on my phone, looking at a selection of pointless updates on Facebook. My older son remained asleep, while his brother crept downstairs to play on the computer. I knew that with a little application, we could continue doing this until lunchtime, blaming the weather for our inertia. But a brief glint of sunlight from a passing car hinted at a morning that was too good to be squandered. A walk on the South Downs was the answer. I told my younger son to get his coat.   We started here, in the shadow of the Long Man of Wilmington. The beauty of this hill figure, \"as high as forty men\", is that nobody knows anything about it. It may be thousands of years old or just a few hundred. We don't have a clue who built it, or why.  Whether it's a fertility symbol, a warning to enemies or a simple work of art is anyone's guess. That's the beauty of the Long Man. Erich von Daniken would probably assert that it's a signal to visiting aliens. As if.I once had the misfortune to work in a bookshop with a large clientele of New Age fans, during which I met a number of charlatans and some people who probably needed more help than a quartz crystal could provide. As a result, I avoid visiting the Long Man when there's any likelihood of spotting a druid.Ironically, they spoil the mystical atmosphere of the place.My son, who is nine, looked very thoughtful and said \"This is marvellous. You know, when I was younger, I preferred the city to the countryside, but I find that as I get older, I prefer the countryside.\"A wise head on young shoulders.I didn't have any particular plan, other than to walk to the Long Man, but my son seemed to be enjoying himself so much, it seemed a pity to stop. So we didn't.The largest hill is Firle Beacon. Virginia Woolf regularly walked across it when she went to visit her sister Vanessa, at Charleston, which is probably a small dot in this photo. Beyond Firle Beacon is Lewes, where Woolf bought her baked beans and bottles of stout. After walking for a mile or so, we saw a village in the distance. I realised that it was Alfriston and suggested that we'd better turn back and walk to the car, but my son was determined to press on and marched ahead, singing 'It's a Long Way To Tipperary'. My son loves singing. He has no idea that he is completely tone deaf.The path that was supposed to cut through fields to Alfriston was flooded, so we took the long way round and walked past some idyllic, asymetrical cottages and solid, Georgian homes. It was almost the perfect, picture postcard village, but was spoiled by a constant stream of traffic. I noticed that my son was extremely pale - he'd never walked this far in his life - so I suggested getting a taxi back to the car park. Unfortunately, I couldn't get a phone signal. The only answer was to either accost a kindly Morris Minor-owning vicar, or consume some calories.We found the village store, where a nice woman made me a delicious sandwich that contained at least twice as much beef as I was expecting. Within minutes, I was beefed-up. My son chose a Curly-Wurly bar and I watched the colour slowly return to his cheeks. I was unaware of the restorative properties of the Curly-Wurly.As we left Alfriston, a pterodactyl-like silhouette circled above the flooded fields. My son had never seen a heron before and was impressed by the huge wingspan. \"This is an adventure,\" he said. \"We never know what we're going to see next. Those Disney places pretend to give you adventures, but you know what to expect.\"Good, I thought, that's saved me several hundred quid and a weekend of hell at Disneyland Paris.After a fairly steep climb, my son asked to stop and we sat down for a few minutes. I looked at the piece of grass next to me and saw that it was actually made up of many different plants, some of them barely visible, clinging on to a bedrock that was comprised of the bones of billions of prehistoric creatures. It seemed miraculous. Then I noticed an odd, whorl-shaped object:It was a snail, unlike any that I have found in my garden. I looked closer and realised that the whole area was littered with these tiny shells. I will be contacting the relevant authorities about the discovery of the Cochlea Steerforthum.As we walked back, I thought of a conversation I had with a friend in the pub, yesterday evening. We both agreed that we had reached an age where we could no longer afford to squander time. We might live for another 40 years and remain in reasonable health for much of it. But we might not.Going for a long walk on the Downs may not qualify as a 'bucket list' activity, but it had the sense of being what Frank O'Hara called the \"real right thing\" and that, I think, is all anyone can ask for."},
{"title": "Lost in Translation", "date": "Wednesday, February 18, 2015", "text": "Today I did a 400-mile round trip for a 15-minute meeting. I think it went well, but I'll know more in a couple of months' time.When I got back, I decided to work out the relative cost of hiring vans and drivers to transport my books, versus buying a van of my own. A quick search on eBay yielded this result:But although the price was attractive, the description left me none the wiser:\"Hi, this is a me Van seling me freinds behalf : this it's a very nice and clear van inside + outside, don't be more used, last year drived only 500 mileage !Mot is valid for half off april 2015, this week be changed new front head lamps for passinger side.

{"title": "The Dogfish It Was That Died", "date": "Sunday, February 15, 2015", "text": "After a week of unremittingly grim, depressing weather, I didn't expect to be spending today lying on a beach with my coat off, staring at a dead dogfish. It's the little surprises that keep me going. I was already planning to visit the Ladybird exhibition at the De La Warr Pavillion in Bexhill, but the Mediterranean weather was an added bonus. Standing underneath this cupola, it felt as if I was in Greece.A 180° turn would have quickly ruined that illusion. The exhibition was packed and instead of the usual quiet reverence, the rooms buzzed with the enthusiasm of grown-up children, recognising a once-loved but long forgotten image:Seeing the original illustrations only increased my admiration for the artists. Even something as simple as milk being poured into a glass became a thing of beauty. For several decades, the Ladybird illustrators were overlooked in favour of their more quirky contemporaries. But although realism of Ladybird may have been less interesting artistically, children preferred it. We didn't want sketchy drawings that alluded to the real thing; we wanted the thing itself.As an adult, I might prefer Miroslav Šašek's London to the Ladybird one, but the child in me loves the clear, unambiguous world of the latter:The world of Ladybird is an impossibly idyllic one. Daddy goes off to work at the office, the children walk to school, while Mummy enjoys a leisurely morning in town, chatting to the local shopkeepers.Daddy is not having an affair and Mummy is not on valium.Oddly enough, my early childhood was remarkably similar. The shopkeepers all knew me by name and train drivers smiled and waved when I stood by the railwayline. Terrible things may have been happening in the world at large, but not in Teddington.Was it all the illusion of a small child? Was the real world more like this: \"Now bugger off and stop asking daft questions.\"I'm not sure, but I think that Ladybird books reinforced the partial illusion that our parents tried to create when we were little: the world is a kind and safe place. Revisiting that vision can be a bittersweet experience, highlighting the disparity between our infantile hopes and the reality that awaits us. The Ladybird world is a Platonic paradise, free of class conflict, religious antagonism or political strife. There are no terrorists, paedophiles or murderers. The occasional burgular appears, but is quickly apprehended by the local bobby on the beat. Order is restored.What, if anything, will inspire the same nostalgia in the middle-aged of the 2040s? My older son is already nostalgic about computer games of ten years ago, so perhaps it will be dominated by obsolete technology and the characters of Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft.A friend told me that last week, the long-forgotten fax machine in her office suddenly sprang into life, after years of silence. As the ancient thermal paper slowly and noisily emerged from the rollers, my friend realised that none of her 20-something colleagues knew what a fax was. In the corner of the office, a man in his 40s was quietly laughing to himself.After the exhibition, we walked over to the beach and enjoyed the novelty of sunbathing in mid-February, wriggling until the pebbles reached a comfortably orthopaedic configuration. It was some time before we noticed a dead dogfish lying next to us, camouflaged against the stones.It was as perfect as a Ladybird illustration."},
{"title": "Trains, Plays and Auto-Awesomes", "date": "Sunday, February 08, 2015", "text": "This week I've spent more time in London than I have working. I feel as if I've gone through the motions of commuting without the unpleasant business of actually having to do a job. This morning, I found myself here:Google's 'Auto-Awesome' feature is continuing to randomly mess around with my smartphone camera photos, but I'm not complaining. The black and white version above is far better than the original below.Perhaps there's a feature that automatically mutes the garish colours of hi vis jackets.I'd arranged to meet up with two friends whom I've known since I was 11. They were running late, so I popped into St Paul's and killed time by sitting in the Whispering Gallery. Stupidly, I'd forgotten how it had earned its name and wondered why I was hearing strange voices emanating from the bare walls.Fortunately, the voices were only telling me to wave if I could hear them.After a stroll around some monuments to forgotten 18th century heroes, I met my friends.We have all gone off in very different directions during the last few decades, but there is an ease that comes with old friendships, perhaps because we know the child within the adult. Today, we recalled our first trip to London and my near-demise at the hands of Duran Duran, who were speeding through the back streets of Knightsbridge and narrowly missed knocking me off my bicycle.Would my death have been a price worth paying to stop hits like The Reflex seeing the light of day?We talked about the career choices we'd made. One friend worked as a software developer and had watched three alpha male colleagues become absurdly wealthy and successful in their early 30s, only to pay the price for it ten years on, with broken marriages and heart attacks. All three were now dead. Next time I'm sorting through a tonne of books in a freezing cold warehouse, I shall congratulate myself for not jeopardizing my health with a successful career.After saying our goodbyes, I walked to the station platform and waited to board my train. Next to me, a small, dumpy woman in her late 60s was fussing with her husband's coat collar, as if he was a little boy. The train doors opened and we walked towards the one vacant table.The wife pointed to some empty coffee cups: \"You can clear those up before we sit down.\" The husband meekly obliged without saying a word. They then sat in silence until the tannoy announced that we were in coach number five of twelve. 'Ooh, \"coach number five of twelve\"', she imitated, in a sarcastic voice. The husband asked his wife what she had said. \"I'm not saying it again!\" she snapped.I looked at the husband. He had the air of a broken man and I was slightly disturbed to see the faint traces of a black eye. Almost as if she could read my mind, the wife blandly announced \"As you sow, so shall you reap.\"The husband remained still and silent. Another passenger that caught my eye was this individual: I didn't manage to get more than a blurred snapshot, but you get the general idea. I'm used to mad hair but the facemask, with its metal shield over the nose, was a little disturbing. Perhaps they had allergies.However, the most offensive person was a young businessman, two days ago, who was talking loudly on his phone so that we could all hear how dynamic he was: \"Yup, yup, I'm gonna be smashing into it over the next few days...\"'Smashing into' was a new one on me, but it falls into the same league as actioning and escalating. It's part of a growing trend in which people try to claim kudos for what they intend to do as a means of distracting attention from what they haven't achieved so far. The crude, macho metaphor was clearly meant to impress.The call ended and the man dialled a new number: \"Yeah, behind Sainsburys...okay...turn left...yep...\" There was a paused and he sighed theatrically. \"Look, I don't want options\" he said, aggressively. Okay? Just tell me where I should go.\"I could hear a woman's voice on the other end of the end. I wanted to take the phone and say \"Don't do it. He's a complete plonker.\"We were on our way back from seeing 'Treasure Island' at the National Theatre: It was a competent production, but the real star of the show was the amazing set and beautiful lighting (by the wonderfully-named Bruno Poet). Out of the circle below, a three-storey cross-section of a sailing ship emerged, with people sitting in fully-furnished rooms. It was quite stunning:I'm more aware of the sets these days, as my father-in-law was a lighting designer and we always used to feel grateful when a critic noticed his work in a review. His lighting plans for operas were incredibly complex, like a schematic for the Hadron Collider, but he was an artist by training and used his switchboard like an painter's palette. The results were stunning, but I wonder how many people noticed his work. I suppose we all see different things. I was particularly moved by a beautiful sea shanty at the end of 'Treasure Island', arranged by John Tams. My wife could barely remember it, but my younger son had noticed, as he's not a big fan of musical theatre.Six weeks earlier, we went to see a friend's daughter in a production of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. I had promised my son that it wasn't a musical, but there was rather more singing than we expected.Afterwards, I asked my son what he thought:\"It was good apart from the music. The poster should have said:  Warning. May contain traces of songs.\""},
{"title": "The Lost Idyll of Ladybird", "date": "Wednesday, February 04, 2015", "text": "One of my earliest memories is of sitting on my mother's lap, looking through the 'Ladybird Book of Nursery Rhymes'. The insistent rhythms of the verses made a lasting impression:\"Fiddle-de-dee, fiddle-de-dee, the fly shall marry the bumblebee...\"But most of all, I loved the illustrations:  Perhaps the illustrator of the Dan Dare science fiction comic-strip wasn't the natural candidate for a collection of nursery rhymes, but Frank Hampson turned out to be an inspired choice. His pictures are some of the most evocative in children's literature.In his illustrations,  Hampson created an idyllic, pre-industrial England of villages and market towns, without a single Satanic mill in sight. The fashions and buildings were (like many of the rhymes) mostly 18th century, but sometimes a steam engine, Victorian top hat or Tudor ruff would add a note of temporal discombobulation.I often wonder whether these illustrations inspired my later life. I do seem to have ended up living somewhere that's remarkably similar to this illustration for 'Hot Cross Buns'. Is that Lewes Castle in the background?Of course in the real world, the hot cross bun man would have been driven out of business by Caffè Nero and I'd have to resort to a pain au raisin, served by some over-familiar barista. Many of the verses are of unknown provenance, but the occasional obsolete rhyme points to their antiquity. For example, in 'Tweedledee and Tweedledum', barrel rhymes with quarrel.  And in 'Goosey Goosey Gander', wander rhymes with gander:This was one of my favourite illustrations, from an age in which Gloucester was synonymous with Doctor Foster rather than Fred West. A contemporary version would probably end with Doctor Foster suing Gloucester City Council or, at the very least, phoning the Potholes Hotline. I also loved this idyllic, Devon-like scene of rolling hills, unpolluted rivers and falling children. The rhyme, which appears in the second volume, has the benefit of a little-known additional verse to 'Jack and Jill', in which \"Dame Dob...patched his nob.\" A line that would have caused no end of sniggering when I was at school. Some of the nursey rhymes have a rather melancholy tone. When Old Mother Hubbard discovers that her cupboard is bare, there is no hint of any possibility of redemption. Something that my three-year-old self found quite hard to take.I preferred the world evoked in 'Tom, He Was a Piper's Son', with its blue sea, brightly-coloured clothes and the prospect of sailing off to exotic lands. Sadly, if you search for it on YouTube, there's a strong possibility that you'll stumble across this very disturbing Japanese manga version. I had to exorcise myself afterwards by listening to the Carpenters.My least favourite illustration was the slightly harrowing image of a little boy waiting to be beaten in 'I do not like thee, Doctor Fell'.The Wikipedia entry for Doctor Fell, which is said to date from 1680 (the rhyme, not the Wikipedia entry), is a fascinating read. I had no idea that Fell was a real person, or that Hannibal Lecter used the name as a pseudonym. Today, boys aren't encouraged to hang around harbours and chat to sailors, but in this counting rhyme we're presented with a far more innocent world. I seem to remember my son being given a tape of children's songs, which included \"One, two, three four five. Once I caught a fish alive...\" It met with a mysterious accident. My son didn't complain. This illustration for 'Jack Be Nimble' is pretty straightforward, but some of Frank Hampson's pictures make me wonder what he put in his pipe. This bizarre vision of 'The Man in the Moon' is wonderfully bonkers:'The Old Woman in the Basket' is also rather odd, with its depiction of a blue space. Intriguingly, the Ladybird book has a version that uses \"quoth\" instead of \"said\" - a word which has been out of use for at least 250 years: How do you draw blind mice? Hampson's solution is rather novel. However, the prize for the most eccentric illustration is the one for 'This Little Piggy': Quite why Frank Hampson suddenly went all 1960s, with a moped and television, I don't know. The perspective is also rather odd.Proust had his madeleines. I have my Ladybird books of nursery rhymes. Just one look at any of the illustrations is a bittersweet experience, recalling a happy time in my childhood, but also reminding me that I don't live in a carefree world of endless summers and tricorn hats. I don't think I've ever quite recovered from the disappointment."},
{"title": "Crisis? What Crisis?", "date": "Thursday, January 22, 2015", "text": "My book sales are slowly dwindling. I need to put some more stock on sale, but every other day I either have to drive my mother or older son to an appointment somewhere. Today, I accompanied my mother to the local hospital for a heart examination.The receptionist of the cardiology department was morbidly obese - at least 35 stone (500lbs or 225kg), which seemed at odds with the posters advocating cardiovascular health. I wonder if she picked the job because it had an on-site crash team.My mother was seen quite quickly and within an hour it was all over. Apparently her heart wasn't firing on all cylinders, but given that it's been beating non-stop since 1929, is it any surprise? I tried to sound shocked but, frankly, she's much healthier than most people of her age.While we waited for a taxi, I went to get a cup of tea for my mother. The only place I could find was a Costa Coffee. The queue consisted of working-class pensioners who were completely baffled by the bewildering selection of flat whites, mochaccinos and cortados. \"I just want a cuppa tea dear\", one lady said plaintively, to a nonplussed Latvian barista.Hospitals used to have small cafeterias serving weak tea and the sort of coffee that vaguely resembled washing-up water, but I suppose it's more lucrative to lease the franchise to a chain staffed by minimum-wage migrants. People tend to say two things about the National Health Service. The first is that it is wonderful. The second is that it is in crisis. On my (admittedly anecdotal) experience of many visits to several different hospitals, I'd say that, for a free healthcare system, the NHS is surprisingly good, if not wonderful. And it isn't in crisis. At least, not yet.The crisis will happen. When the welfare state was conceived, the average working man could be expected to retire at 65, tend his allotment for four to five years before doing the decent thing and expiring. Today, thanks to antibotics, statins and anticoagulants, that same man will live for an additional ten years (at least) but often with a number of chronic health problems that require regular supervision and medication. As for his wife, she can expect to spend around a quarter of a century in retirement, consuming more drugs than Keith Richards, albeit prescription ones.As the medication improves it will only get worse (or better, if you're an 80 year old who wants to live forever). But by the time I am 80, I expect the problem will have solved itself, when civil order collapses and I am either beaten to death by an angry mob or eaten by my neighbours. Before I end my days, as I dig up a shrivelled, mutated turnip from the radioactive soil of my garden, I will look back longingly at the days when we thought that a crisis meant having to wait six months for a hip operation."},
{"title": "Vera's Leg", "date": "Wednesday, January 21, 2015", "text": "Today I accompanied my mother to a hospital appointment in Brighton. We went by taxi, which seemed liked a good idea until the driver cheerfully told us that he was being treated for a brain tumour and wasn't really supposed to be at work. I watched his erratic driving and wondered if my life was going to end where it began, with my mother. While I was sitting in the back of the car, like a child on a day out, my mother talked about the light dusting of snow on the hills as if it was the beginning of a new ice age. The driver nodded and concluded that \"There's worse to come, loike.\"The hospital waiting room was packed and resounded with inane chatter about grandchildren and illnesses. I could tell that my mother was desperate to talk and I felt torn between being the good son and preserving my sanity. \"I'm glad you could come with me. Vera wouldn't have been any good here. She has to have her leg dressed every day at the moment.\"I knew that a graphic description of Vera's leg was about to follow, so I quickly got out my copy of Jonathan Franzen's 'Freedom' and started reading. My mother took the hint.An hour later, we were met by a different taxi driver. My mother introduced him as her favourite and as they sat in the front, chatting about the weather, kitchen extensions and the terrible parking at the hospital, I couldn't help feeling that he was the son she should have had. I wonder if I am a disappointment to her. Of course it goes both ways. I would like a mother who occasionally showed some interest in what I was doing, or even asked me about the book I was reading. But how many people have easy relationships with their parents? I can't think of anyone.One of the most perceptive and moving television dramas about family life that I've seen recently is HBO's 'Olive Kitteridge', adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-wining 2008 novel by Elizabeth Strout. Beautifully acted, this four-hour mini-series has been almost universally acclaimed, apart from a Guardian critic who complained that it was \"slack\" (it wasn't).Here's a trailer, in case you haven't seen it:In the background, you can hear a haunting arrangement by Martha Wainwright of a 1980 song from the album 'Xanadu'. I'd never come across 'Magic' before and have tried in vain to find Wainwright's performance. However, if you strip away the cheesiness, the original by Olivia Newton John is rather gorgeous too:You may disagree."},
{"title": "Going Online", "date": "Sunday, January 11, 2015", "text": "It has been an odd winter so far. Flowers are in bloom, flies have been lazily buzzing and clothing retailers are desperately discounting their stock of unsold thermal wear. So far so good, but the mild weather has also been accompanied by flash floods and the occasional gale force wind.Is it climate change? I don't know, but I was disturbed to read that the number of flowers in bloom on January 1st had risen from around 40 to 436. I've been taking advantage of the mild temperatures by going for several walks around the local area. I suppose it's part of my New Year's resolution - the one I have every year: lose weight, exercise more and drink less. It's always been a half-hearted crusade, but the death of a close friend has strengthened my resolve.My other vague resolutions for 2015 are as follows:To have a holiday - it's three years since we went anywhere. I know that it's a bit of a 'First World Problem' and if you're reading this on a solar powered tablet by a mudhut in the Okavango, I'm sorry for whinging, but when I signed up to being a parent, an annual family holiday was one of the clauses in my contract.To stop our garden from looking as if it is in Pripyat. If this blog suddenly stops, I've probably been eaten by one of the creatures that have evolved there.To visit an island. If it's one with a secret base and a kidnapped scientist, that will be even better.To have more fun.  The last resolution is particularly important. If I've had a difficult time with my older son, it's important to do something that breaks the mood. Unfortunately, working alone in a small room logging books only seems to exacerbate any feelings of impending doom. I miss having colleagues. I hope that my son's predicament will improve this year. We're getting a lot more help and the local authority have agreed to pay for him to go to a specialist school (something that only happens if every other avenue has been exhausted). All we have to do now is get him there. I really hope he goes, as it's a fantastic opportunity.But I digress. The original point of this post was simply to share a few photos from today's walk around Lewes. First, a typical local scene:These public allotments have a ridiculously long waiting list, as the bien pensants of Lewes all want to  prepare themselves for the post-oil economy by growing a few radishes. I'll die before my turn comes up.One time I walked along the road next to the allotment and saw Kevin Bacon, which must get me top marks in the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game (in case you were wondering why he was there, he was filming a commercial. Not one for allotments). This disused railwayline, on the eastern side of Lewes, has a unsettling, post-apocalyptic atmosphere. It looks innocuous enough in this photo, but the abandoned sidings and eerie silence suggest that a disaster has taken place (other than the Beeching Report).The railway line passes under this bridge. The writing reads: \"GATEWAY MEDIUM. CHALK IS A GATEWAY MEDIUM. CHALK IS A GATEWAY MEDIUM. CHALK IS A GATEWAY MEDIUM...\" and so on.I wondered what it all meant.Later, I Googled the phrase, not expecting to find anything. To my surprise, this YouTube clip appeared:The video left me none the wiser, but an additional one minute's research suggests that this phrase comes from the LAPD, who sent officers in riot gear to arrest Occupy protesters who were writing slogans in chalk.Accused of being heavy-handed, the police allegedly replied that chalk was a \"gateway medium\" to full-blown vandalism. Naturally, this phrase invited ridicule. Further along the line, to add to the sense of unreality, a nearby tree had this earring hanging from a branch. It felt like a clue in a second-rate detective drama. As I examined the jewellery, I heard my wife saying \"Ugh, that's horrible. Don't tell Dad. He'll want to take a photo of it.\" I turned and saw her looking at something on the ground. She was right. I did."},

It was quite fitting, as I was on my way to see the Chapman Brothers' exhibition before it closes on Wednesday.Jake and Dinos Chapman seem to have a knack of upsetting people. Their Facebook page includes the following comments:\"You guys are disgusting! Your work is coming from minds darkest places, you are doing anything to get fame. Shame on you both!\" - Arash\"Prison is the only place you should be in!Shame you!\" - OttaInspired by Bosch, Goya and the Holocaust, works like this excite strong feelings, from admiration to outrage:I must be a bad person, as I admired the apocalyptic scenes of Nazi soldiers, skeletons and crucified Ronald McDonalds . I felt that the Chapmans' art had a clear moral purpose, compared to the lazy, sixth form humour of a work like Martin Creed's prize-winning 'The lights going on and off'. Their art also made me laugh: Asked to explain the reason for the Ronald McDonalds, the Chapmans provided this explanation:\"We take McDonald’s as being a marker of the transformation from industrialisation to the end of the world. McDonald’s once represented the idealism of fast food and the space rest era. Now it’s consistent with the dilation of the ozone and a litigious clown who’s lost his sense of humour.\"(Source - www.deliberation.info)I'd always perceived the Chapmans as one-trick shock jockeys, gaining notoriety by deliberately picking the most contentious subjects. Visiting the exhibition made me revise my half-baked ideas, realising how much thought and hard graft had gone into their work.In contrast to the horror and depravity of the Chapman Brothers' art, the De La Warr Pavillion in Bexhill is having an exhibition of art from the Ladybird books, beginning on January 24th. As a lifelong fan of Ladybird, I can't wait."},
{"title": "A Tale of Two Christmases", "date": "Wednesday, December 24, 2014", "text": "As the only child of two teetotalers, my first Christmases were not riotous affairs. We would get up at seven o'clock, eat a bowl of cereal and wait for the electric fire to warm up the 'lounge'. Like many working class people of that time, my parents had a strange habit of only using their front room on special occasions.After our perfunctory breakfast, we would change rooms and my father would put his 'Christmas with James Last' LP on the stereo. The music was pure kitsch, but I still have a soft spot for it:Every year, my presents would be stacked underneath a formica coffee table with wobbly legs. I could barely contain my excitement. In contrast, my parents treated their presents with the dogged professionalism of someone cataloguing a crime scene: \"Soap on a rope from Chris and Lesley\".In spite of being very religious and patriotic, my parents didn't attend a church service or watch the Queen's Christmas Broadcast to the Commonwealth. I've no idea why. At 11.30, my father would collect his parents from Twickenham, a mile away. It would be an understatement to say that my grandmother was not the most cheery of souls and for the duration of their visit, we felt as if a dark spell had been cast over the day. Christmas 'dinner' - always served at midday - was consumed in semi-silence.There were no games.But if my recollections sound rather melancholy, I should add that I always enjoyed Christmas Day. The misery of being with my grandmother was a minor distraction compared to the excitement of having a new train set, or a box of Lego. In my naivety, I assumed that most families had similar Christmases to mine, following the same routine. However, when I spent my first Christmas away from home, with my wife's family, I had a rude awakening.My wife's family were the polar opposite of mine in every respect and teetotalers were regarded with the same horror as child molesters and trade unionists. If you wanted to be accepted in their solidly upper middle class world, you had to show that you knew how to drink.Christmas day began with a champagne breakfast and cold meats at my wife's grandparents' home. I'd never drunk alcohol at breakfast time before and could almost feel my body recoil in horror. How would I get through the rest of the day? At mid-morning, a succession of visitors arrived, while the grandparents held court in the bar of their sprawling Tudor house. Everyone became increasingly drunk and my memory of the period between 11.00 and 3.00 is almost non-existent, but at some point we must have walked back to my mother-in-law's, as I remember waking up there in the afternoon.In the evening, we returned to the grandparents' home, where more guests arrived and the drinking resumed. By nine o'clock, the grandfather walked over to a grand piano (which had weeds growing underneath it) and a singalong session began, with a medley of music hall favourites and songs from the 1930s and 40s. A rude version of 'These Foolish Things' was the highlight.Christmas dinner - a well-hung pheasant - was finally eaten at 11.00pm (apparently it got later every year) in a large hall, warmed by a roaring inglenook fire. More bottles were opened.  After the main course, it was apparently traditional to have indoor fireworks. By this point in the day, everyone was so drunk, they barely noticed when one of the fireworks rose from the table and set fire to the Christmas decorations. I felt as if I had entered a madhouse.The contrast between the two family Christmases couldn't have been greater: one, a sobre, muted affair; the other, a fun but exhausting bacchanale. Since those days, my wife and I have aimed at having a Christmas that is somewhere between the two extremes.However, as a homage to our dear departed, there will be five minutes of James Last, accompanied by the carcinogenic smoke of an indoor fireworks display.Merry Christmas."},
{"title": "The New Dystopians", "date": "Sunday, December 07, 2014", "text": "If, like me, you're resistant to SF but enjoy well-written speculative fiction, 2014 has been a vintage year. I've read so many new titles centered around the collapse of Western civilisation, it's been very hard to resist the urge to stock up on tins, dried pasta and firewood, not to mention the illegal weaponry needed to protect your baked beans from any marauding gangs.Here are some of the novels I've enjoyed most during the last few months, in no particular order:1. Station Eleven - Emily St John MandelWritten by a Canadian author who now lives in New York, Station Eleven has been universally praised by critics and readers alike. Set 20 years after a devastating pandemic, the novel follows the fortunes of a band of actors and musicians called the Travelling Symphony, as they move around the post-apocalyptic settlements of the Great Lakes. The initial premise didn't immediately grab me, but I was quickly won over by the compelling plot, a clever narrative structure and some hauntingly beautiful prose. I stayed up until a ridiculously late hour because I had to know how the book ended. It was well worth the sleep deprivation.2. The Book of Strange New Things - Michel FaberA novel about a Christian missionary on an alien planet might not be everyone's cup of tea, but this is one of the most humane and poignant novels I've read for a long time. Written in the shadow of Faber's wife's terminal illness, the interstellar distance between the main character and his wife, trapped in a future Britain that is facing societal collapse, feels like a metaphor for the author's own sense of impending loss. In a recent edition of the radio programme Start the Week, Michel Faber stated that he wouldn't be writing any more novels. I hope that it was just the grief speaking.3. The Bone Clocks - David MitchellIf Christian missionaries on alien planets is beyond the pale, then this novel probably isn't for you, as the plot is utterly bonkers. However, David Mitchell writes with such brio that it's more than worth going along for the ride. Spanning half a century between the early 1980s and the 2030s, I found the novel's coda surprisingly moving and a very satisfying conclusion to the literary pyrotechnics of the main plot. The Bone Clocks is a confident riposte to anyone who thinks that the novel is dead. You'll either love it or hate it.4. A Lovely Way to Burn - Louise WelshThe first book in a trilogy (the other two parts haven't been published yet), this is a crime novel set in a London that is being ravaged by a pandemic. Welsh has been highly praised for her earlier novels and although this book reads as if it has been aimed at a more mass-market readership, with an emphasis on plot rather than character, its depiction of a city in crisis is powerful and evocative.5. The Southern Reach Trilogy - Jeff VanderMeer Actually three separate novels - Annihilation, Authority and Acceptance - this was a revelation. VanderMeer is classed as a science fiction writer, but with influences as disparate as Iris Murdoch and Rachel Carson, this is a beautifully-written, astoundingly imaginative series that transcends the limitations of genre fiction. It's dangerous to try and second-guess a novel's influences, but the plot reminded me of the shortlived 2005 television series Invasion, the Body Snatchers films and the recent low budget (but high concept) independent film Monsters. However, the science fiction elements almost feel incidental and the central question is always the same: what is it to be human? Imagine Lost written by Margaret Atwood and you'll have some idea what to expect.It has been said that it is the conceit of every generation to feel as if it's at the end of the line, whether the threatened annihilation is deistic, nuclear, biological, economic or environmental. However, the number of mainstream writers tackling this theme seems to be growing by the year. Is there something in the air? Have we finally grown out of the Enlightenment belief in perpetual progress?The answer presumably lies in the combination of a growing awareness of potential threats - global warming, the end of oil, pandemics, economic stagnation and overpopulation - with the increasing willingness of 'serious' writers to flirt with other genres. And after all, the post-apocalyptic scenario is a gift to any writer of fiction.In the meantime, I will be busy forming the Lewes Militia, just in case. I've already designed the epaulettes for the uniform and started drafting the new laws. Anyone who begins their sentences with \"So\" will be in trouble."},
{"title": "Untitled 1", "date": "Friday, November 28, 2014", "text": "I had a slightly disconcerting experience in the gents' loo of a restaurant last night. As I walked in, several men turned round and looked at me with a mixture of incredulity and contempt. It was very unsettling. I quickly checked myself in the mirror, but couldn't see anything out of the ordinary. The men left and I resolved not to give in to any feelings of paranoia, but in the silence that followed, I became aware of some very strange atonal piano music playing in the room. I can safely say that I have never heard piped Webern in a public convenience before and it only served to enhance the sense of unreality. Perhaps the restaurant manager was indulging his quirky and sometimes inappropriate sense of humour. After a brief pause, the music continued. The new movement reminded me of the soundtrack to a particularly grim Eastern Bloc animated film. Outside, I could hear some innocuous folk playing in the restuarant. It was all very odd.Then I finally realised that the music was coming from my pocket. I must have pushed an app button on my smartphone and the strange looks from the men were a perfectly rational response to a man entering the loo with atonal music emanating from his nether regions.It was the second of two embarrassing misunderstandings this week. The first happened at my son's ninth birthday party.For the presentation of the cake, I dimmed the lights and put on the third side of the Beatles' White Album, which begins with the song 'Birthday'. The candles were blown out and the boys seemed to be enjoying the music and having the lights off, so I left them to it.Unfortunately, when the parents arrived, they found their sons sitting under a table in a dark room listening to 'Revolution 9' blaring out \"Number nine. Number nine. Number nine. Number nine...\" I tried to explain, but I think it only made things worse. I shall be glad when this week is over. In addition to public embarrassment, I had to spend most of Wednesday in the A&E at Haywards Heath, after my mother had fainted at a concert. Fortunately she regained consciousness quickly, saying \"Well, they weren't very good singers anyway.\" The doctor wanted to keep my mother in for tests, so that they could eliminate the possibility of a blood clot. Sadly, this meant spending six hours sitting in a cubicle, listening to my mother talking non-stop about other people's ailments. At one point I suggested that she should have a sleep, but she didn't take the hint.Perhaps I'm being churlish, but six hours of \"Doris with the neck needs to be near a toilet...There are a lot of coloured people working here...Brenda didn't pay me back for that pint of milk I bought...Vera's cross because the window cleaner didn't come on Thursday...\" is five hours and 45 minutes more than I can take. The one enjoyable moment this week was visiting the De La Warr Pavillion in Bexhill, just as the sun was setting over the sea. As long as there are moments like these, everything else is tolerable.

For some reason, Google Plus has automatically tarted two of them up. I've no idea why and can't be bothered to find out.My workplace isn't exactly glamorous, but even the most mundane features seem to acquire a strange beauty when the setting sun highlights the rough contours of the surfaces of buildings and objects:I must bring a proper camera in one day and capture the post-apocalyptic splendour of my farm.It has been an annoying week at work. A courier lost a bag of orders a few weeks ago - something I didn't discover until customers started emailing to ask where their books were. After a three week tour around the Midlands, the parcels were returned on Tuesday in a large box, along with a packet of 10,000 staples. I think the staples were another mistake, rather than some form of recompense. I have now switched to Royal Mail. They may have an online ordering system that makes the Enigma machine look simple, but at least I know that the books will reach their destination instead of sitting in a warehouse in Leicestershire. I enjoy working in the countryside, but can't quite get over its oddness. On Monday a stranger asked me if I'd like to see his puppy (you could get arrested for that in London). He opened the back of a car and handed me a beautiful 13-week-old spaniel, with adoring eyes. Later, on the way home, I saw a man standing on the corner of a road with a falcon perched on his hand. I've no idea why.On other days, I'll suddenly see a succession of people ride past in horse-drawn carriages, or spot someone casually carrying a rifle with a telescopic sight. It's only a matter of time before I go native."},

{"title": "Yesterday and Today", "date": "Friday, November 07, 2014", "text": "I've started to get into the habit of taking a regular 'constitutional'. I particularly like going for a walk in the late afternoon, when the light is failing and the shadows are long. The highlight of the journey is usually a flock of sheep, but yesterday I saw a familiar-looking figure:It was one of several effigies made by a Lewes bonfire society, ready for last night's procession. This year, they managed to alienate a sizeable number of people in both Russia and Scotland. They did  Kim Jong-un last year. I think they're gradually working their way around the globe.I have mixed feelings about Bonfire, as it's known here. On the one hand, I enjoy the sense of anarchy and the sheer spectacle, but it also reminds me how isolated we have become as a result of my older son's difficulties. When we first moved to Lewes, I assumed that one day we would all dress up as a family and join the procession. I now realise that will never happen.This morning, my wife and I took our younger son to the Museum of London, where he was supposed to be studying the Romans:I don't know why, but I just can't get excited about the Romans. They came, they saw, they conquered. Then they left.On the other hand, the prehistoric gallery was surprisingly fascinating, reminding us that elephants once grazed by the banks of the Thames, whilst people lived in straw huts in a landscape that was mainly marshland and forest. A flint tool from around 450,000 years ago was genuinely awe-inspiring. Every gallery was really well curated and arranged in a way that created a strong sense of a narrative. My son loved it and we all resolved to make a return visit.After the Museum of London, we walked to the Tower of London through a particularly ugly area. This picture is from Wikipedia, as I forgot to take one:A combination of bomb damage and bad planning has largely ruined this part of London, but it's a thriving business district and we walked past countless glass office buildings, watching a succession of very earnest-looking people having meetings. In one office, the computer screensavers said \"Client Focused\", as if it was something special.The thought of having to sit in a meeting, listening to humourless people talk complete bollocks on a daily basis, sent a chill through my heart. I remembered being subjected to 'brand wheels', KPIs (key performance indicators) and 'upskilling' (training). It was awful.Fortunately, just as I becoming a little grumpy about the business world, we arrived at the Tower of London and saw this incredibly moving tribute to those who died in the First World War:880,000 artificial poppies. One for each person who died, painstakingly placed in the ground by volunteers.  I was also extremely moved by the huge crowd of visitors (there were several thousand when we arrived), some of whom had travelled a long way to look at the display. A few had simply come to see the spectacle, but I suspect that many were paying tribute to a lost grandfather or great-uncle, and felt that one of the poppies was theirs. I certainly did.N.B - Click here for some stunning photos of the full display."},

Fortunately, I spotted it just in time and a brief flick through confirmed that I'd found a gem. It's a collection of photos of the northern industrial town, Consett. To quote from the book's blurb: \"For 140 years Consett in County Durham was synonymous with iron and steel. Then in 1980 the works were shut down and subsequently dismantled by the largest demolition projection in Europe. The town was left with a 650 acre hole in its centre, not to mention a legacy of unemployment and demoralisation.\"I hadn't heard of the book's editor, Julian Germain, but as soon as I visited his website I recognised his photos of classrooms around the world, from a book that has been featured in several weekend supplements. I shall be adding that to my Christmas list. Steel Works is divided into two sections. The first features photographs from Consett when it was a thriving industrial town in the 1960s. Contributors include Don McCullin and Tommy Harris. The second part looks at post-industrial Consett, a town that seems abandoned even though its inhabitants still live there. Here is a selection:"},

One involves working in idyllic surroundings, with a view of the South Downs in the distance, listing quirky antiquarian books in a pleasant, weatherboarded office. The other requires long periods of manual drudgery, sorting through huge deliveries of stock, trying to push rusting, back-breakingly heavy wheelie bins along muddy ground that feels like the shore of a tidal estuary. Although they have lids, the bins still collect an extraordinary amount of rainwater and when I start to move them, they expel their brackish liquid from a small hole, like nervous sheep.Next to the bins, there is a collection of odd machines, haphazardly mounted on planks. I have no idea what they are for:During the last six months, I've watched the view from my workplace gradually change: Autumn has clearly arrived and the late afternoon light is noticeably weaker.

I think he'd rather be acting, but it's good to have some company for a few days. The temperature has been in the early 20s (or 70s, if you prefer) recently, but soon it will plummet and the books in the warehouse will feel like blocks of ice cream. I'm not looking forward to that. I can usually handle ten books before my fingers begin to seize up.Yesterday I found a dead rat lying in a grass verge.

{"title": "Locked in a Bookshop", "date": "Sunday, October 19, 2014", "text": "A few days ago there was a minor Twitter frenzy, when a poor Texan tourist found himself locked in the Trafalgar branch of Waterstones, after it had closed for the day.He tweeted: \"Hi @waterstones I've been locked inside of your Trafalgar Square bookstore for 2 hours now. Please let me out.\" Waterstones replied \"Thanks for the tweets today! We'll be back at 9am tomorrow to answer your queries :) Happy reading!\"Fortunately, thanks to the power of social media, he was released within a few hours. If it had been 25 years ago, when I worked at Waterstone's, the poor man would have probably still been there the following morning. It was a good story, but less unusual than people might think. I've locked people in a bookshop several times and I know that some of my former colleagues have too. It's more easily done than you might think.On each occasion, we walked around the shop floor shouting that we were closing, then started turning the lights off, beginning at the top floor. This was usually a foolproof way of forcing people downstairs, like moths to the flame, until the only source of light would be the street lighting outside. But sadly some people failed to take the hint. One poor man was deaf and didn't hear the annoucement, but I still wonder why the darkness didn't make any impression on him. Another man was foreign and, perhaps, came from a country where unlit, empty shops were the norm. (Thinking about it now, it was always men who got stuck in the shop)Another time, some members of the criminal classes deliberately hid in the shop and went to a great deal of effort to open our safe, even making a hole in the wall behind it. They failed. If they'd succeeded, they would have found less than £1000 in cash. Once we'd twigged that shouting and darkness weren't sufficient clues, we became more vigilant and no further incidents followed. But to return to the locked Texan, during the Twitter storm, several people remarked how they'd love to be in an empty bookshop at night and I remembered the times when I took advantage of having the key to the shop. Sometimes it was just enough to be able to browse without being disturbed by anyone. But I also remember dancing on the shop floor at midnight with some friends, playing my favourite tapes on the PA system at full volume and, on one occasion, walking around in my boxer shorts, just because I could.In another branch, the manager and her staff would often go to the pub until closing time, then return to the shop for a pyjama party, during which more alcohol was consumed until everyone finally collapsed from exhaustion. I've also heard that a few customer sofas have been the scene of some decidedly non-literary encounters between members of staff.Of course, none of this could happen today. These days, shops have digital CCTV and sophisticated alarm systems, so dancing in the dark, noctural nudism, midnight couplings and sleepover sessions are no longer an option. Even entering the shop outside trading hours would probably count as gross misconduct. How sad.On the plus side, if you want to get locked in a bookshop, you can now feel reasonably confident that you won't stumble on any safecrackers, copulating booksellers or midnight bacchanales, so it's probably a good time to try. Just head for an upopular section like poetry or transport and keep your head down. Good luck.P.S - Please check the opening hours. An absence of customers and staff is no longer an indication that the shop is actually closed."},
{"title": "From the Ridiculous to the Sublime", "date": "Saturday, October 11, 2014", "text": "A few weeks ago I bought several tonnes of books, in the belief that they would yield a reasonable amount of saleable stock. Sadly, my hopes have been dashed. Most of the books look as if they have have come from a dystopian, alternate past, in which good literature never happend.Here is a selection of some of the more striking examples:In a scientific poll of three people, 66.6% found this cover rather creepy, while the remaining 33.3% found the reaction of the other respondents quite disturbing. Before J. K. Rowling, there was J. K. Stunt - Joyce Kathleen Stunt to her family and bank manager. Her novel was reprinted several times, but didn't survive the cultural cull of the late 1960s.I suppose that having a human-looking deity standing on the porch would have appeared a little odd, so the illustrator played safe and opted for a celestial light, but the end result looks as if an atomic bomb has exploded.Imagine an alternate reality in which Hitler didn't shoot himself in the bunker, but escaped to Argentina on a small yacht, accompanied by his favourite cuddly toy, Gunther. \"Well Mrs Fotheringale, you're clearly suffering from an all-too-common case of feminine hysteria. You should spend the winter in the south of France, but until then I'm giving you some laudanum. Take thrice daily.\"There's nothing amusing about this cover. I just think that it's a rather lovely example of early 60s graphic design.Two decades on, book covers weren't so aesthetically pleasing. This title, by one of the many David Mitchells of this world, features a battle of the perms:Next, a possible example of shameless plagiarism, published six years after the debut of Thomas the Tank Engine:With its prophetic, Beechingesque title about rail cuts, this title is far more fast-paced and surreal than the rather pedestrian Rev. Awdry books, but for some reason Eileen Gibb's series never took off. Perhaps it was something to do with copyright.Finally, not a book, but a beautiful album for collectors of monograms and crests, which more than made up for the odd, unsellable books that have dominated the last week:This splendid album, which has a very useful supplement of mottoes and classical quotations, begins with a preface:\"The collecting of Crests and Monograms is rapidly increasing in popularity, and ranks second only in point of interest with Postage Stamp collecting.\"The pages all have attractive borders with spaces for collectors to paste their monograms on:Most of the crests and monograms are no larger than an adult thumbnail, so I've enlarged them:One for eBay, I think.Some hobbies deserved their demise - the collecting of phone cards is one example that springs to mind. But the monogram was a glorious thing and although it may be gone, I hope is not forgotten."},
{"title": "Homeward Bound", "date": "Wednesday, October 08, 2014", "text": "I went out for a drink in London with some old friends on Saturday. I don't see enough of them, but we all live in different parts of the country. In a perfect world, we'd all be in the same town and have a local pub. The journey home began well enough. I found an empty table, kicked my shoes off and began reading the new Michael Faber novel. Then, just as the train started to edge of Victoria Station, three middle-aged women surrounded me and started chatting loudly about something they'd been to. I stopped reading. Suddenly, one of the women noticed me. \"Oh, I'm afraid we've rather invaded your space. Would you like to have some wine with us?\" It seemed rude not to say yes.After finishing my plastic glass I tried to have forty winks, but it was impossible. The women were loudly going through lists of men's names and discussing their eligibility as suitors. If a man wasn't interested in them, he was gay, apparently. The younger of the three boasted about the number of men she meet through Twitter and complained about the reluctance of one of them to marry her in Las Vegas, or indeed anywhere.A few minutes later, the conductor announced that due to engineering works, the train wouldn't be going any further, so would we all please transfer to the bus replacement service. My heart sank, particularly when I saw an oxymoronically-named 'Crawley Luxury' coach, with Lewes as its destination.We waited in the dark, dank forecourt, like refugees fleeing from a conflict. We wanted to go home, but our driver, a small, wiry, bald man, with an earring and a nylon short sleeve shirt, had other ideas. On the edge of the crowd, a young man asked if there was time to have a smoke. The driver nodded and the young man lit a joint. A well-to-do man in his 50s said \"Hmm, that's a rather nostalgic smell.\" A few people laughed, to advertise the fact that they also had a bit of a past.After ambling around the coach for the tenth time, the driver suddenly decided that we might as well go and asked us to take our seats. The engine clicked into life and Heart FM blared Black Box's 'Ride On Time' through the speakers. It was going to be a long journey. To make things worse, it soon became clear that our driver had no idea where he was going. At first, I assumed that he was following a special drivers' route, but when we passed Horsham Station - 10 miles in the wrong direction - a man in a pinstripe suit and metrosexual shirt decided that enough was enough. To his credit, the driver didn't bother trying to pretend that he knew what he was doing and the rest of the journey involved the passengers shouting directions in unison every time we approached a turning: \"LEFT...NO, LEFT!\" Our 27-mile journey took one hour and 20 minutes. Next time, I think I'll share a taxi with a few people.But I digress. I was meant to be sharing a book jacket that I recently discovered: 'Gourds', by the aptly-named John Organ. Marvellous."},
{"title": "\"And Your Point Is..?\"", "date": "Thursday, October 02, 2014", "text": "I'm writing this in the relative safety of our loft, while downstairs, our new kittens are tearing the house apart. Losing their testes hasn't made any discernible difference to their urge to destroy, so I'm not quite sure what to do. Perhaps a giant wheel is the answer.There's no theme to this post. It's just a hotchpotch of things I've noticed during the last few days.First, another candidate for my gallery of bad art, courtesy of the Lewes branch of Pizza Express:I remember creating doodles like this in the Paint programme of Windows 3.1, if I was feeling particularly bored. It must have taken all of five minutes to do the curved lines, then click and fill the gaps with different colours. It's a pity, as the Pizza Express itself is lovely. They deserve better than this:Next, a rather uncomfortable choice of bookmarks for a title about African tribes:UK readers will recognise the Golly branding from Robinson's marmalade. I was surprised to learn that it wasn't ditched until 2002. According to Wikipiedia, the \"brand director\" at Robinson's insisted that: \"We are retiring Golly because we found families with kids no longer necessarily knew about him. We are not bowing to political correctness, but like with any great brand we have to move with the times.\"On the subject of moving with the times, I've noticed that in the 1960s, it was the Panther imprint that took the lead in spicing up innocuous novels with saucy covers:When the once-popular Howard Spring's sales started to dip, someone in Pather's sister company, Fontana, decided that a little more sauce needed to be added. This cover, for a novel that was originally published in 1934, promised more than it delivered:Next, a wonderful advert from a novel published in the 1890s:As you can see, Queen Victoria herself described the hats as \"extremely becoming\", which is is almost indecently effusive by her standards.(*NB - I have now been informed that this endorsement would have been from 'The Queen' magazine. Another dream shattered.)Sadly, Mr Heath's business didn't survive the hatless postwar years, but you still see the beaver statues that graced the top of his premises. There is also an interesting piece about Henry Heath's hats here. Next, one of my favourite bookmarks so far: a menu from the RMS Ascania, for Friday November 27th, 1925:The Corn on Cob au Beurre  and Ice Cream and Wafers aren't terribly exciting. Was this for the 2nd Class passengers? I haven't been on a cruise, as I abhor any holiday in which one is forced to socialise with other tourists, particularly when the only means of escape is overboard. I don't go abroad to make friends with someone from Leatherhead. The one time my wife and I went on a group holiday, it was a disaster. The trip turned out to be mainly composed of Daily Mail readers (I think it was a special offer in the paper) and I spent the entire week hiding from people. I started off with good intentions. However,  an agonising group lunch, during which a woman boasted that her husband was \"big in concrete\" exposed the gaping void between our worlds. I was later caught hiding from everyone in a vineyard, while my wife explained that I was \"shy\".The trick is to travel with a small group of like-minded people. I once shared a villa with some people who worked at the House of Commons, via a tenuous connection with someone I knew in my teens. We met at Gatwick Airport and by the time our plane had landed, we were laughing and trading good-humoured insults like old friends. Every day was a real laugh. At the end of the holiday we swapped names and addresses and agreed to meet up in London, but naturally none of us bothered.It can be quite comforting to let your hair down with complete strangers without the messy business of maintaining a friendship, which leads to my final bookmark: an agenda for the British Association for Behavioural Psychology's annual conference at Exeter, in 1976.The agenda for Saturday 24th is a punishing schedule of symposiums and lectures, including the following:Group relaxation with agoraphobicsMarital group therapGroup relaxation with stammerersTraining the compulsive gamblerImaginal exposure with dental phobicsCost effectiveness of behavioural psychologyThe aetiology and treatment of sex disordersThe list goes on, but I'm sure you'll be as pleased as I was to learn that in the evening, between 8.00 and midnight, they had a disco. The thought of a hall full of behavioural psychologists bopping away to \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" makes me wish I was there: \"Oooh-hoo, Nobody knows it. When I was down. I was your clown. Oooh-hoo...\""},
{"title": "Early Colour Photographs", "date": "Friday, September 26, 2014", "text": "I often find old colour photographs that are hand-tinted black and white shots, but the genuine article is a rarity. Today I found three early examples of a medium that, to my surprise has existed since the 1860s. The first one, from 1919, is particularly gorgeous:At first glance I wasn't sure where the picture was taken, but then I realised that it had to be British. What other country would have anything as daft as garden gnomes? The photograph was taken by an amateur - a Mrs A Barton - and is called 'Harvest Bounties'.The next picture was taken by a Frenchman called Jean Tournassou in 1915:'Soldiers in the Field' is beautifully composed, but perhaps it also shows how the French army, with their colourful uniforms and ceremonial swords, were an anachronism in the machine age (he said, quickly checking Wikipedia to see if an off the cuff sweeping generalisation can be backed up).This picture was taken by Louis Lumiere of his mother and her granddaughter. It's hard to believe that this is actually a photograph, as the sepia hues and quality of light make this look like an oil painting. The granddaughter looks particularly Rubenesque.Finally, two images that are a far cry from the age of Lumiere, but really exited me when I saw them yesterday: the surface of the planet Venus. The only pictures I've seen up until now have always been distorted and of poor quality, but someone has taken the raw data sent back from the Soviet Venera probes and used it to reconstruct the actual view. As you can see, our \"sister planet\" looks even less inviting than Mars:(On a nerdy, space probe note, I'm really looking forward to seeing the first close-up pictures of Pluto, when the NASA mission arrives there next July)."},
{"title": "Go West", "date": "Sunday, September 21, 2014", "text": "For the last two years, the radius of my world has been about 60 miles. It is a far cry from the days when I was able to visit Chile, but on the plus side my carbon footprint must be relatively low. Today I drove west and visited Bosham (pronounced Bozzum, I am reliably informed) to do the usual thing of walking around aimlessly, making slightly appreciative noises, imagining living in one of the houses and looking in vain for somewhere to eat, before getting slightly bored and leaving.With mudflats and wading birds, Bosham was like a little piece of East Anglia in Sussex, although the locals seemed to be a little more prepared for the effects of global warming:Down by the waterfront, Boden-wearing families hoisted the sails of their yachts, next to a sailing club building that read \"MEMBERS ONLY\" in block capitals. If you fancy joing the yachting set of Bosham, there is a three-bedroom house on sale, half a mile away, for 1.6 million. (I've always liked the idea of sailing and once put out to sea in a dinghy that cost £17, from a beachside kiosk. It had two air pockets, which I later learned was a bad thing, but it got my girlfriend and I from Charmouth to Lyme Regis without incident.)After a failed attempted to have lunch in Bosham, we drove towards Chichester and stopped at the first pub we saw. That was a mistake, but hunger makes madmen of us all.I should have noticed that I was the only male who wasn't wearing a JD Sports football shirt, plus the ominous queue for the carvery - all you can eat for £6.95. We paid in advance and were handed a wooden spoon by a woman in leopardskin leggings: \"You 'ave ta wai' 'til they call y'numbah.\"I'm not a big fan of carveries. The emphasis seems to be on quantity rather than quality and there is something particularly unedifying about seeing people greedily filling their plates with twice as much as they need. A woman in front of me had two large portions of lukewarm meat, six roast potatoes, three Yorkshire puddings and enough cauliflower cheese to feed a family of four in World War Two.I had half as much and still felt like an anaconda digesting a horse.As an antidote to the carvery, we visited the excellent Pallant House Gallery in Chichester. Situated in a Georgian house and a modern annex, the gallery has an intelligently-curated mixture of 20th century British art and I would recommend it without reservation.I particularly liked the way that the contemporary art was displayed in a traditional setting, for example this work by Andy Goldsworthy, which was put in a fireplace:The work below is rather intriguing. At first glance, it doesn't make any sense.But a closer inspection reveals hundreds of mussels filled with velvet. It still doesn't make any sense though. The next gallery is particularly marvellous. Can you guess what is so unusual about it?The answer is that the sculpture is only slightly larger than my thumb. This is a 1930s project which sought to recreate well-known works by contemporary artists, in miniature: In contrast, the person below is life-size:This extraodinary cloth doll was created by Jaan Howarth, the wife of Peter Blake (apparently she helped him design the cover for Sergeant Pepper). The figure is the same person as the man in Kitaj's painting, just behind. A guide told us that a small boy started drawing the dummy on a school trip and came back in his own time to complete the sketch. He was horrified to find that the hands were in a slightly different position. I appreciated the gallery's enlightened attitude towards taking photos. Obviously it's a pain when people use noisy, bleepy cameras and flash bulbs that recreate an atomic blast, but for those of us that use silent cameras on suppressed flash, it's good to be able to snap away without being made to feel like a naughty schoolchild. After an hour, my wife became galleried-out and was delighted to find a room with comfortable seats and a view of Chichester's attractive Georgian back streets. I found a community art project that consisted of square tiles, each of which was made by a different local person:It was surprisingly good. I say surprisingly, because so many exhibitions of works by local artists are astoundingly awful. Chichester is clearly a hotbed of creative talent.Even the street art in Chichester is a cut above the usual standard:The one disappointment of the day was seeing that Marks and Spencers had got away with removing this traditional frontage, which I photographed four years ago. Another defeat in the battle against Clone Town Britain.But with its quirky, Georgian streets and Roman heritage, Chichester is anything but a clone town. In the words of the Terminator, I'll be back."},

Perhaps the sight of a raddled-looking man in his 40s was less appealing than the handsome young man who wrote On the Road, as nobody slowed down to pick him up.

At last, it looked as if my business had recovered from the two months I'd lost to illness, earlier in the year. Little did I know that within days, it would all go horribly wrong. I won't bore you with a lengthy account. The short answer is that my courier company decided to shut down my account, as a business that trades from the same farm as me owes them a lot of money. I have always paid my bills on time, but they wouldn't budge:\"Please be advised that as a business we are not totally convinced that there isn't a link between your company and ********.\" I offered to provide evidence that I was a completely separate business, but their reply more or less said that they had neither the time nor the inclination to look into it.I looked at the sackfuls of uncollected orders and wondered what I was going to do. An internet business can go down very quickly if its orders aren't fulfilled in time. Waiting until an account with a new courier was set up wasn't an option. In the end, I took the only sensible option available: I bought an awful lot of stamps. It has been a challenging few days, but I have taken my inspiration from a pot outside a neighbouring unit, where people throw their cigarette ends: Like the weed, perhaps I will triumph over adversity. It would be good to find a courier that, like Steve Austin, is better, stronger and faster. One that doesn't routinely lose parcels and delivers promptly to the time-conscious Germans. When things are difficult at work, I usually look forward to going home, but for the last few weeks our house has been taken over by two psychotic male kittens, pictured below:(I should point out that the second kitten is not actually locked in the stove, but is merely reflected in the glass)We have taken to hiding upstairs behind closed doors, while they demolish sofas, disconnect telephone cables and sit on our modem until it overheats. I'm not sure if getting two cats was a good idea. On Saturday evening they became so manic, we ended up fleeing to the safety of Brighton beach, for a fish and chip supper.On the subject of Brighton, I saw these beautiful magic lantern slides in Hove Museum yesterday. I was trying to explain to my younger son how miraculous they must have been in a world without cinema or television. He seemed to enjoy them as much as I did.My older son remains in his room. He hasn't been out for nine months, apart from a few medical appointments and a trip to his grandmother's. My wife is very good and never loses hope, but I have felt mine slip away and feel desperately sad that he has lost a large part of his childhood. Perhaps I need to distract myself with a hobby.

{"title": "Bad Art", "date": "Sunday, August 31, 2014", "text": "It's amazing how much bad art there is. I don't just mean the obvious suspects, like this:Or this:I mean the sort of art that is sold by supposedly reputable galleries. It ranges from the type of stuff that my mother thinks is \"nice\" (\"It's so good, it could be a photograph...\") to a lazy modernism that looks vauguely like Warhol, Rothko or Pollock, as painted by someone with no talent. I say this with authority, as I've spent several evenings trawling through websites, trying to find a painting for the chimney breast in our sitting room. I thought the internet would offer an embarrassment of riches, but it has been a depressing experience. However, I have learned some useful lessons:Avoid artists with shortened names like Mick, Bob, Roz, Jen etcDon't bother with eBayLook up an artist you like on Google images to find kindred spiritsCheck the sizes - I almost bought a linocut that was only marginally larger than a Burkina Faso postage stampA good print is better than an indifferent originalBut in spite of this learning curve, my internet searches remained fruitless and I failed to find anything until today, when I discovered an artist in the real world who seduced me with her wares. She was selling prints of linocuts from her studio in Jevington, a hamlet in Sussex which has a church tower that is over 1,000 years old and a restaurant that invented the banoffee pie. I'd never seen an original linocut before and probably asked a lot of stupid questions, but I hope that my enthusiasm compensated for my ignorance. The cash must have helped too.After buying a couple of prints, we went for a walk along the South Downs Way and I took a photo, which Google Plus has shamelessly pimped up: I'm completely baffled by Google Plus.Why has it suddenly started altering my photos and why are complete strangers adding me to their circles? Also, what is a \"hang-out\"? I've never quite got to grips with social networking. Sometimes I get Facebook friend requests from complete strangers, with no message attached, and I wonder if they have confused me with someone else. I usually decline. I'm also similarly confused by Linkedin. Why would an executive in an oil company want to connect with an impoverished bookseller from Sussex, unless they needed to be reassured that they've made the right career choice. It would be good if people had to explain why they want to connect. Another annoying trend is the tendency for social networking sites to try and pull all of our telephone and email contacts. I can't see the sense of this, because it is only natural to compartmentalise the people we know into different groups. Most of us have a public and private persona and never the twain shall meet. But I digress.Returning to main theme, why is there so much bad art (and although you might say that taste is subjective, I challenge you to defend the first two paintings)? I can only assume that many people disagree with me, which is why gallery owners stock acrylics of rural scenes and people dancing. The other day I was driving through Henley-on-Thames and saw a sign advertising a sale of Jack Vettriano paintings. In Henley!Perhaps I'm the one who's wrong - a Lewes snob, with delusions of grandeur.But snob or not, at least I don't call my dog Voltaire, unlike a man I saw at the vets' the other day. I must find out where he walks the dog and video him shouting \"Voltaire! Voltaire!\" It could be another Fenton."},
{"title": "Cookham", "date": "Thursday, August 21, 2014", "text": "The other night a curious thing happened. While my wife was sitting in the front room, she suddenly heard the voice of a friend who died ten weeks ago. There was no mistaking the throaty, transatlantic drawl:\"Hi, I just wanted to say thanks. I hope you're all right and feeling better. Things are pretty quiet here...\"It seemed to be coming from the next room - not the one from Henry Scott Holland's overused poem, but our dining room. My wife got up and tentatively walked towards the hall. The friend was now saying something ominous about meeting up soon. As she slowly pushed the door open, there was a sudden scramble and one of our two new kittens jumped off the answerphone and ran for cover. Our friend's message ended and a new one from my mother began. My wife felt a mixture of relief and sadness.The kittens arrived on Saturday, delievered by an interesting woman who once educated Meryl Streep's children. Unlike our last cat, which was like an angelic Victorian consumptive, dying after only two months, these two brothers are reassuringly energetic. Whether they'll help my older son or not remains to be seen. Cats, dead friends and old jobs were on my mind today, while I drove to Henley-on-Thames to deliver some books to a client. I had plenty of time to think, as the traffic was appalling and what should have been a three-hour round trip was nearer five.I decided to make the journey worthwhile by adding a brief diversion to the Stanley Spencer Gallery in Cookham, 10 miles east of Henley. The gallery claims to be the \"only gallery in Britain devoted exclusively to an artist in the village where he was born and spent his working life.\" And it's only five quid to get in.I'm not quite sure what I think of Spencer's paintings, which seem to cover a spectrum from William Blake to Beryl Cook, via John Nash, but some of them have grown on me.This is Spencer in 1914, before he saw active service in the First World War. His experiences in the army had a profound effect on his art: \"my ideas were beginning to unfold in fine order when along comes the war and smashes everything.\"Traumatised by war and the loss of his older brother, Stanley Spencer sought solace in his beloved childhood home, Cookham - \"a suburb of Heaven\", which he used as the setting for his visionary art:Spencer is known for his religious paintings, with their claustrophobic crowd scenes, so I was a little surprised by the number of conventional landscapes, like this one:According to this excellent website, Spencer was long regarded as a \"provincial joke\", but has been recently cited by some as the greatest British artist of the 20th century. I suspect that he was neither.   After visiting the gallery, I decided to have a stroll around Cookham. It was pleasant enough, with many quirky, interesting buildings, but like so many traditional English villages and towns, it has been ruined by a constant flow of heavy traffic. When I crossed the road, I took my life in my hands.Cookham lies on the bank of the River Thames, roughly 30 miles west of London. This is the landscape of The Wind in the Willows, Three Men in a Boat and Alan Ayckbourne's Way Upstream (worth watching on YouTube, if you have the time), with leafy banks and small islands, not to mention Toad Hall.The parish church has a small memorial plaque to Stanley Spencer, which I couldn't find. The grounds are generally well-kept, apart from a section which contains 17th and 18th century graves. Here, the stones are covered in ivy and blackberry bushes, with their names weathered beyond recogntion: But inside, a memorial from 1713 looks almost as good as the day it was made. I must start saving up for a mausoleum. As I made my way back to the car, I passed this curious object:This is the \"Tarry Stone\", which was the site of a local sporting event for centuries until 1507. I've no idea why things changed in 1508.According to Wikipedia, \"In 2002 Cookham was at the centre of a row over a description of the village's social profile as \"somewhat spoiled by the gin and Jag brigade\". Famous (i.e. minor celebrities in the UK) residents include Timmy Mallett, Ulrika Jonsson and jeweller Gerald Ratner.Like a Ratner gold bracelet, Cookham looks like the real thing, but scratch beneath the olde worlde surface and Spencer's \"suburb of heaven\" is more like an extension of London. The number of BMWs speeding through the narrow streets suggest that it has become a dormitory town for the wealthy. I wonder would what Stanley Spencer would make of it all."},

{"title": "The Long Shadow", "date": "Sunday, August 03, 2014", "text": "There must be very few families in Britain whose lives weren't touched by the First World War. The story of my great-uncle Fred isn't particularly remarkable, but it is no less tragic than any other.Frederick Robert Brown was the second oldest of 12 siblings. His parents ran a corner shop in Isleworth, where the children were expected to help out from an early age. By all accounts, Fred was a remarkable young man who enjoyed rowing on the Thames, singing in the local church and being a surrogate parent to his younger brothers and sisters. My grandmother worshipped him. He matriculated at the Isleworth County School and got his first job working as an office clerk at the Thames Lighterage Company, at Brentford Docks. In his spare time, he studied French in Hammersmith - a decision that may have been his undoing.When Britain declared war on Germany, 100 years ago today, Fred was keen to do his bit. He went to the local recruiting office and was assigned to the Royal West Kent regiment. He was very proud of the \"West Kents\" and sent his sister this postcard:Fred Brown trained at Shoreham, Sussex and his exemplary conduct and knowledge of French meant that he was promoted quickly and sent to the Front before many of his peers. On September 8th, 1915, he posted this card to his family:Less than a fortnight after this postcard was sent, Fred was killed in the Battle of Loos. There was no body, so he was officially listed as missing. The family took the lack of a body as a sign of hope.A letter from Fred's pal, Charlie Fowler, reinforced their belief that Fred was still alive:\"I made several enquiries from wounded fellows, that were with me at Boulogne. They went into action on Sept 25th. Fred was seen to be hit and fall while they were advancing over open ground.Later wounded or killed they do not know, as when one of the sergeants helped to collect the casualties the next day, Fred was not among them, as the ground that they had been on at the time had been counter-attacked by the Germans and several of Fred's company had been taken prisoners.I believed myself that he is a prisoner. He's been wounded, if he is.\"Fred's family waited anxiously for news, but none came.My grandmother was closer to Fred than anyone else in the family and she couldn't reconcile herself with the possibility that her brother was no longer alive. As the war progressed, she contracted a mysterious \"disease of the blood\" and had to be sent to a sanitorium in Lancing.In hindsight, it is clear that my grandmother had a breakdown. By all accounts, this once carefree young girl was never the same again and I remember her as a bitter, disappointed woman, who refused any attempts to help her.My grandmother married in 1925 and seemed to have a successful marrige, but was unable to show any real affection towards my father, who became a deeply insecure adult. I often wonder what sort of person my father would have been if he'd been shown more love as a child. He was a good man, but very highly strung and desperate for approval from others. His mother never showed any interest or pride in his achievements.My father's anxious temperament grew worse with age. High blood pressure was a constant problem and it was no surprise when my father had a succession of heart attacks, spending the last 10 years of his life virtually housebound. Perhaps it's fanciful of me to trace it all back to the death of Uncle Fred, but I can't help seeing a cause and effect.The First World War has cast a long shadow on many families' lives. I am planning on going to Loos in September 2015, for the 100th anniversary of the battle. I presume there'll be some sort of commemoration,I will be there to honour Fred, but also the people he left behind and the lives they never lived."},
{"title": "Think Before I Write", "date": "Friday, August 01, 2014", "text": "When I first started blogging, I used to write all sorts of nonsense. After all, I thought, nobody reads this blog. On one particular day, I wrote about a mundane visit to a bookshop and decided to spice it up by replacing a real person with a slightly villainous Dickensian character, adding grotesque details for comic effect. In those days, it wouldn't have occured to me that people could confuse my fiction with the real person. But today, I received an email from the owner's distraught wife, appalled by my portrayal of her husband. My first reaction was to think, \"But I wasn't writing about your husband\", then I reread the blog post and realised how naive I had been to think that the fiction was self-evident. Needless to say, I was mortified and have apologised, along with removing the offending post. This blog is supposed to be mildly entertaining, so the knowledge that I have unwittingly hurt someone is deeply upsetting. Over the years, I've grown to realise that a simple blog post can make waves. In my case, those waves are the very minor ripples that one would find in the boating pond of a municipal park, but it still calls for a degree of responsibility and self-awareness. Perhaps I should have listened to Vladimir Putin, who takes blogging far more seriously than me. Today, the Russian parliament have just passed a law, requiring any blogger with more than 3000 hits a day to register with a state regulator. Opponents of Putin, like Gary Kasparov, have been effectively silenced. I used to think that blogging was just a space to present ideas - an artificial universe that was only tenuously connected to the world we live in. But, today, I have realised that once the words are out there, anything can happen."},

Next Monday promises to be a relatively subarctic 21C - I can't wait. Several interesting books have turned up recently. My favourite is a rather odd American catalogue of bird cages from 1930. I'm not sure why anyone would buy it, but after selling books on electricity substations and condensed milk, I'm no longer surprised by anything. Another useful find was an old 60s paperback of George R. Stewart's fine post-apocalyptic novel, Earth Abides, which I read avidly over two days. It had a garish science fiction cover, but didn't read like a sci-fi novel and fortunately there were no maps with a 'western sea' or people with apostrophes in the middle of their names. I'd thoroughly recommend it.In addition to bird cage catalogues and 1960s paperbacks, four mysterious photographs turned up. The first two are from 1966:This reminds me of my childhood home, from the garish carpet and curtains to the ill-matched prewar furniture. I expect the television was rented; ours was. And for most people in Britain, this was the 'Swinging 60s'. The Beatles may have just released Revolver, but I don't think my parents or their friends were aware of it. The next two photographs are a mystery and I'd be grateful if anyone could shed some light on the locations. The first looks as if it is war-damaged. But where?As for the next picture, it vaguely resembles the Stargate - perhaps it's the portal that sends people from Stoke Newington to Lewes when they have children. Answers on a postcard please. The winner will receive a copy of the C.H.I.Ps Annual, if they want it."},
{"title": "Art Therapy", "date": "Sunday, July 20, 2014", "text": "I was meant to be in Wales this weekend, attending a reunion, but circumstances conspired against me. It was frustrating - I'd be been looking forward to going for months - so I decided to make up for it with a day out in the local area.Instead of driving 275 miles west, I drove 20 miles east:Beachy Head is usually a little bracing, as the almost horizontal trees bear witness, but yesterday it was more like the Costa de la Luz, with warm winds gently buffeting the coast. The suicide chaplin half-heartedly did his rounds, looking for solitary figures at the cliff edge, but I think he knew that it was going to be a quiet day.Before going to Beachy Head, I stopped off at Birling Gap, to see what damage the winter storms had done. The small pile of debris at the bottom of the cliff was a bit of a disappointment, but I knew that the tearoom I took my mother to last summer had fallen into the sea. The newly-rendered side of this terrace suggests that the storms had also claimed a house:I don't know how much these houses are worth, but I suspect that a 25-year mortgage isn't on the cards. After viewing scenes of carnage and destruction, I ambled along the coast to Eastbourne's Towner Gallery, to see an exhibition of works by Peggy Angus:Rather than give you a potted history here, I would recommend visiting the website of James Russell, who is an expert on mid-20th century British artists in the Ravillious/Nash/Bawden milieu. He has written some excellent books on Ravillious, Paul Nash and Edward Seago and has just published a new title on the life and art of Peggy Angus. I think it would be fair to say that the sum of Peggy Angus's art was greater than its parts. Her paintings don't compare well to those of her friend Eric Ravillious, but her greatness lay in her determination to bring art into everyday life, energising everyone around her. Not content to remain in the rarified world of fine art, she also designed tiles for public buildings, wallpapers for homes and clothes to wear. She passionately believed that we should resist mass-production and uniformity, creating our own art.Mrs Steerforth was as impressed as I was and we both agreed that we should put some of Peggy Angus's ideas into practice in our own lives.The Towner Gallery is one of the best in the south-east. The building is well-designed and, unlike some of its counterparts, has an impressive amount of content. Entrance is free, but after a visit to a chi chi cafe with 'artisan' bread rolls, I must have funded the purchase of at least one new painting for their collection. In addition to the Peggy Angus exhibition, there is also an excellent collection called Designing the Everyday:I particularly like this rather insouciant depiction of the male theatre-goers as porcine, purse-lipped fops. And this plate by Ravillious is one of many that I coveted.Bouyed-up by our day at the Towner, we decided to take our youngest son to Charleston Farmhouse, where the Bloomsbury Group covered almost every square inch of the interior in murals, tiles and paintings:My son is eight and has an interest in art and architecture (his favourite programme is Grand Designs) that has come entirely from within him. We are trying to foster this enthusiasm with visits to galleries and 'make and do' sessions at home, but don't want to be too heavy-handed. It mustn't feel like schoolwork. Charleston usually has guided tours, which are very interesting but would have bored my son rigid, so I picked the one day in the week where there are no tours. I wanted him to be able to wander around freely, looking at whatever took his fancy.Sadly, from the moment we arrived, a posse of eager women pounced on us. Would our son like to fill in a quiz? No. Had we been here before? Yes, so bugger off and leave us alone.There was one volunteer guide per room and most of them seemed determined to tell us everything they knew about each room, whether we wanted to hear it or not. When one particularly keen woman asked my son what the table legs reminded him of, I wanted to say \"Leave the boy alone! Let him look in peace.\"Luckily, my wife was only too happy to respond to the guides and started asking them increasingly obscure questions. She pointed at a violin and asked \"Who played that?\" The guide looked crestfallen. \"Oh...I don't know.\" Then, like an admonished child, added \"But I know all of the main things.\"I shouldn't be rude about the guides. They are genuinely passionate about Charleston and the guided tours are some of the most interesting I've ever had, but they need to realise that some visitors just want to look at the art without any distractions.I used to have similar problems with my older son, who has Asperger's. During one visit to Kipling's house, a well-intentioned volunteer started asking him questions about school. She was trying to be friendly, but within seconds he went from being relatively relaxed to feeling as if he was going to be sick.Perhaps these places could introduce a scheme where people who wanted to be left alone could wear a simple badge. If it was successful, it could extended to taxis, hairdressers and barbers. The visit ended in the beautiful gardens. I asked my son what he thought. \"It was great. I really liked it, but not those guides.\""},

Sometimes I feel like Alan Bennett with his mother, trying to make sense of the stream of consciousness that pours from her lips:\"Pat's been to the hospital again. It's DVD this time. If it was Val you'd never hear the last of it. Those chrysanthemums have lasted haven't they. I can feel a draught. Mind you, I water them more than Louise does, but not too much.

Julia said that he shouted a word at them that's even worse than the F word. I didn't know there was one. Did you?\"I made a noise behind my Rich Tea biscuit that could have meant yes or no.\"I asked Daphne if she knew of a worse word than the F word and she said she didn't know there was one either.

{"title": "Star Trek - The HR Perspective", "date": "Tuesday, July 01, 2014", "text": "I watched an episode of Star Trek yesterday, for the first time in years. The episode was called 'The Immunity Syndrome'. I have fond memories of the programme from the 1970s, when I would have a bath in the evening before changing into my Star Trek pyjamas, exclusive to buyers of Kellogg's Sugar Smacks.Sadly, the programme wasn't as exciting as I remember and I spotted a number of things which, frankly, gave me cause for concern. There were several health and safety violations, an alarmingly high number of incidences of sexual harrassment and a performance issue that needs to be raised at an appraisal. I will be raising the following points with the Starship Enterprise's HR manager:1. A Poor Ergonomic Working Environment:Mr Spock's 'What the Butler Saw' machine, where he looks at science and tells the Captain what is happening, is a health hazard. The many hours spent in a stooping posture will produce chronic back problems and may necessitate sick leave, leading to early retirement.I also noticed several tripping hazards. A health and safety review is urgently needed. 2. Disabled Access:With its steps and barriers, there is no provision for disabled employees on the Bridge. If Captain Pike decided to pay a visit, he would have to remain in the lift. I would recommend introducing ramps and conduct a Disability Compliance Check throughout the whole ship.3. Sexual HarrassmentA number of instances of sexual harrassment were noted. This is a particular concern, given that most of the sexual remarks originated from Captain Kirk himself. I would recommend instigating disciplinary action for Kirk, with a compulsory attendance at a workshop on Star Base 12. I would also suggest that standard, genderless uniforms should replace the current division between trousers for men and short dresses for women.4. Sexism in the Workplace: During this conference on how to save the galaxy, the female member of staff remained silent. None of the male members of staff asked her for an opinion and only made eye contact with each other. I would recommend attendance at a Workplace Sexism Awareness course for all male officers and ensure that a helpline number is displayed on every staff noticeboard.5. Substance Abuse:A constant use of amphetamines was observed, sanctioned by the Chief Medical Officer. These are controlled Class B drugs and it is well documented that regular use can cause psychotic behaviour. I would recommend revoking the doctor's licence to practise and sending Captain Kirk to a substance abuse clinic.6. Poor Discipline.The Chief Engineer's attitude to authority is a major cause for concern. During routine requests for more power from the engines, his response is always negative and possessive. There is also a tendency to anthropomorphise the engines, referring to them as 'she'. I would recommend a written warning, accompanied by a requirement for compulsory counselling.7. Inadequate Equipment:I am particularly concerned by the Shuttle Craft, which is continually running out of power. Poor equipment has a corrosive effect on staff morale. Staff should be provided with equipment which is fully maintained and subject to a regular MOT inspection. I would suggest the introduction of daily compliance checks, to ensure that the Shuttle Craft is always fully charged and in possession of more than half an hour's life support.I hope that my suggestions will be acted on. I don't want to have to take this up with the United Federation of Planets."},
{"title": "Changes", "date": "Friday, June 27, 2014", "text": "For many, opening a bookshop in 2014 is as recklessly anachronistic as buying a typewriter or investing in a new VCR, but Waterstones (now sans apostrophe) have defied the odds and just opened a new branch in Lewes. Don't they know we're all reading on Kindles now? However, if any new bookshop is going to succeed, it will be this one. I've written quite a few posts in the past citing what's wrong with Waterstone's (and when they were owned by HMV, it was a long list), so it came as a pleasant surprise to see a new branch that was absolutely pitch perfect.Everything, from the Farrow and Ball paint to the quirky range of titles, was exactly right for Lewes. But does that mean they'll make any money? On Wednesday, I had a drink with a former colleague from Waterstones who'd been overseeing the Lewes opening and asked her how things were going. She was cautiously optimistic, painting a picture that wasn't one of universal doom and gloom. I know from experience that her default setting is positive, but she didn't gloss over the many challenges that high street booksellers face. It was encouraging to hear that some bookshops still had a future.The age of the 15,000 sq foot behemoths is clearly over, as far as new openings go, but there is a place for smaller shops and apparently, people are still buying books. Just not everywhere.I'm not a betting man, but I'd put money on the Lewes branch being here in five years' time. It deserves to succeed.In other news, as they say on the television, I have finished moving out of the rat-infested hovel that I haven't called home for the last 20 months. I will miss the robins:But I won't miss the smell of several months of accumulated bovine excrement, or the sound of bulls sodomising each other. The move was relatively straightforward, apart from one mishap today, when a piece of metal fell on my head. I feel fine, but it's left a mark that looks like the scar from a frontal lobotomy. I hope it heals, otherwise I will have to wear a hat for the rest of my life.One other piece of good news is that we have succeded in getting a Statement of Special Educational Needs for our oldest son. I won't bore you with the details, but the gist is that if we find a school that can help our son, the local authority will now pay for it. Awards like these rarely get past the application stage, so I can only assume that my son made an impression.On a sadder note, last week we attended the funeral of our closest friend in Lewes. She was 56 and had twin 14-year-old boys, one of whom is severely autistic. The funeral was in two parts: a Catholic Mass in Lewes, followed by a cremation in Brighton. I'd never been to a Catholic service before and felt that both the length and use of ritual added a gravitas and dignity that is often missing from funerals. I'll have to do a deathbed conversion. The ritualistic aspects of the Mass were rather confusing for the Protestants and heathens. About a quarter of the people at the servive were Catholics and every now and then, they would pop up from their seats like a flashmob and chant something. The rest of us sat awkwardly in our pews.When the coffin arrived, everybody took a deep breath and tried to maintain their composure. It seemed extraordinary that our friend was in this small wooden box. A few weeks earlier she'd had lunch with my wife and on the way home, they'd popped into the church hall to vote in the European elections. She voted Green. There was a hushed atmosphere as the coffin was slowly carried along the aisle, then the silence was suddenly broken by the autistic son, who uttered just one word in a flat, emotionless voice: \"Upset.\" At that point, everybody broke down.At some funerals I've experienced grief as a sense of personal loss, but on this occasion it was just a terrible sadness for a friend whose life had been cut short. Our friend faced death without any self-pity and remained interested in the world right up until the last week. She was obviously worried about her sons, but took comfort in the knowledge that her sister in Los Angeles has agreed to take the boys. In a few weeks' time, they will leave Lewes and begin a new life in California.At some point I will write a tribute to our quirky, interesting friend. In the meantime, here's a trailer for a film that was written by her late father, who died only a year earlier. She would have liked this:"},
{"title": "A Miscellany", "date": "Tuesday, June 17, 2014", "text": "I've lost count of how many carloads of books I've transported from my old farm to the new, grandly-named 'business centre', but I've reached a point where enough is enough. The rest of my books are going in the bin. They've been on sale for nearly two years without attracting a single customer, so my conscience is clear. As Channing says in Spearhead From Space: \"Destroy. Total Destruction. \"During the last few long, dusty days of throwing unwanted books in bins, I've come across a few gems. Here are my favourites:As the advertising slogan used to say, \"You can be sure of Shell\". This is from the good old days when having your five a day probably wasn't such a good idea, unless you thoroughly washed the carcinogenic residue off. Thanks to people like Rachel Carson, DDT was eventually banned from agricultural use, although the UK doggedly persisted until the mid-80s. The last time I saw the acronym DDT, it was on a bottle of headlice shampoo. I didn't buy it.This is from a 1940s boys' annual and features a novel solution to the problem of not being able to wear a tie in space. If the British Empire had endured, perhaps this is how we would have conquered space, once we'd solved the problem of how to make a decent pot of tea in zero gravity.There isn't much to be said about this leaflet. I just rather like the early 1950s graphic style. Apparently Nordkapp is Norwegian for Northern Cape.I have no idea who this woman is, but spookily she looks just like a friend who has just died. I'd guess that this was taken in the late 70s or early 80s. The photo fell out of a novel, where it was marking a page.I can't really say why I like this illustration, but I think the combination of of the twilit sky and the lamplight in the foreground reminds me of a magical 'Night and Day' display that used to be exhibited in the Science Museum, many years ago. I don't know why they got rid of it. They kept the Shipping gallery, which was very dull and didn't have any buttons to push. These two images are from a late-1930s guide to photography. Both pictures evoke something of Britain between the wars - an era whose dying embers lasted until the late 1960s (and in the case of my wife's grandparents, the 1990s). The first reminds me of a parade of shops on the border between Kew and Richmond, one of which was a delicatessen that my parents conspicuously avoided, probably because it sold 'funny' foreign food.The second photo has an appealling wintry, Sunday afternoon atmosphere, unusually relaxed compared to most family group shots of the time. The photography book also contained this loose insert:The general message seems to be: feel free to snap away, but not if you're an enemy alien. I'm not sure if this notice alone would be a sufficient deterent to any foreign types, keen on assisting the Third Reich.On the subject of the Fatherland, I opened a 1912 textbook for German schoolchildren learning English and discovered this gently-amusing anecdote: 'James II., when Duke of York once paid a visit to Milton. In the course of conversation he told the blind poet that the loss of his sight might be a punishment laid on him for having written against the late King. \"If, \" replied Milton, \"the calamities of this world are indications of Heaven's wrath, how guilty must your late Highness's father have been! I lost only my eyes: he lost his head.\"'Finally (and apologies to anyone who has already seen this on Twitter), here is a great British brand-name that we don't hear very much of these days.

We have taken up this matter with Headquarters who report that no such announcement has been made by Haw Haw. The B.B.C. Monitoring system, as you know, takes cognisance of all broadcasts from Germany.          It may be of interest to you to know that similar rumours have occured at various times all over the country after enemy air raids. This Ministry has, from time to time, tried to run these rumours down to their ultimate origin in order to find out whether enemy agents are responsible for starting them. In each case, Haw Haw has never made such announcement, and, where it has been possible to track them down to their source, it has been found that (a) an enemy agent was not responsible and (b) the source was usually a disgruntled citizen with an inferiority complex, who wanted to feel important and had started this story in order to let his friends think that he knew something they did not.         I think you will like to have this information to pass on to the people in your neighbourhood.         I have taken up with the Board of Trade the matter raised by your Committee in connection with Mr. T. Galley of Seaside Lane, Easington Colliery, who has been advised that, if he sells six large kettles to an Institution, they will be deducted from his general quota of pans, kettles etc., which will be eventually allotted him.

{"title": "Tales of the Riverbank", "date": "Monday, June 09, 2014", "text": "I had an interesting day in Hammersmith yesterday, collecting some art books from a man who designed this:As I boxed the books, I enjoyed listening to anecdotes about his long career - one that included National Service in the Intelligence Corps, a spell as a paparazzo in the 60s, followed by many years in Hollywood as a production designer. As if that wasn't enough, he'd also found the time to climb the Himalayas, trek across the Kalahari and paint enough canvases to fill a gallery. And he's just published a novel.When he turned to me and asked one of the most feared questions in the English language - \"And what do you do?\" - I had nothing to say. It was pretty obvious that Michael didn't really want to get rid of his books, but he'd been given notice to vacate the building where he rents a studio and didn't have room in the Notting Hill flat he shares with his wife. The studios are right on the riverside and I suspect that they will be bulldozed and replaced with luxury flats, most of which will be bought by foreign investors. It's a great pity that this quirky, interesting building is going to be lost:It's strange to see how Hammersmith has changed from being a shabby, depressed, no-man's land, sandwiched between the West End and the genteel outer suburbs, to a cosmopolitain, middle-class property hostpot.This is how I remember Hammersmith:Today, it feels completely different. The area seems to have undergone some form of ethnic cleansing in which anyone who is either working class, overweight or old (or all three) has been deported. As I tried to load my van with boxes, I had to dodge a constant stream of cyclists and joggers, all pursuing their lesiure activities with the same dogged determination that they devoted to the working week.I also noticed that many of the cyclists were speaking in French.Michael's charming wife bought us lunch at the pub next door and for a moment I thought that I had gatecrashed a supermodels' convention. Svelte young women in expensive clothes, with perfectly waxed legs, checked their smartphones as they waited to be served exotic drinks by trendy bar staff, half dancing to the deafening music.  Where were the old-timers, like The Syrup?(For non-UK readers The Syrup was a character in the TV series Minder: syrup of figs - wigs)I suppose he's now in Margate, with many of the other original Londoners.In many ways, I liked the new Hammersmith. It was a pleasant change to worry about being knocked over by a cyclist rather than being beaten up. It's a long time since I heard anyone say \"Wotchoo lookin' at? Eh? Wanna smackinthamaahf?\" The new Hammersmithonians seemed bright, fit and friendly. Several people stopped to help me when my attempts to load shelving units into the van took a farcical turn. Nobody called me mate.But there is a darker side to the process of gentrification, beside the absurd property prices. Michael's wife said that many of the flats in Notting Hill are now being converted back into houses for Russian oligarchs and there are whole streets full of properties that are only occasionally occupied. A neighbour of hers ended up feeling so lonely and isolated that she decided to sell up and leave.I'd forgotten how much I used to enjoy weekends in London and felt invigorated by meeting interesting new people. It came as a welcome relief from a phone call on Thursday morning, when we learned that our closest friend in Lewes had died unexpectedly. She was one of those people who hated technology and as a result, has no presence on the internet (apart from a brief entry on the IMDB for working on Halloween III). Perhaps I'll remedy that."},

I'm not an aficionado of sand, but my wife thought it sounded intriguing. Apparently, the sculptures are made from sand and water alone, with no cheating.  I was expecting a queue. Instead, we found ourselves in what appeared to be an abandoned building site, with cranes and diggers in the background.Fortunately, the sand sculptures more than lived up to our expectations:It was an extraordinarily windy day and as I looked at the choppy sea, I thought of another June 5th, 70 years ago, when bad weather forced the Allies to delay the Normandy landings for 24 hours. After the sand sculptures, we walked along the seafront and found a fish and chip bar, manned by a terrifying man with a tattooed neck. In the background, tinny pop songs were playing. It was the sort of music I normally hate, but at seasides and funfairs it always adds to the general cheer.Three tracksuited, pot-bellied men in their 60s joined us. \"Look, it's the Sopranos...\" my wife whispered and for a moment, I was expecting them to ask for a cwawfee. Disappointingly, they turned out to be German: Die Sopranen. Eating fish and chips on a windy seafront may not have been the height of glamour, but I enjoyed the brief illusion of being an ordinary family doing normal things. I was pleased that we were able to give our younger son a day out, albeit a short one. We arrived home feeling bouyed-up by the experience.An hour later the phone rang.

If no further posts follow, then you'll know that I've either keeled over or been crushed to death by books. I've been busy moving stock from my malodorous cowshed to a nice new unit, seven miles away, next to this pond: The new unit is free of rats and mink. Also, I no longer have to cover the books in plastic sheeting to protect them from a growing family of robins. However, judging by a discovery someone made yesterday, the building isn't quite wildlife-free:I'm not an expert on nature, but I believe that this is a great-crested newt. Quite why it decided to leave the splendour of the pond area for my new unit, I have no idea.  Moving the stock is a fag (trivia fact - Jane Austen used this expression in 'Northanger Abbey'). I could hire a van and do it all in three trips, but that would be exhausting, so I'm transporting the books one car-load at a time. I've worked out that it will take 37 trips. However, I think I'll have to bin some of the stock. The books that went on sale nearly two years ago seem to have reached the end of their shelf life and rarely appear on my list of titles sold. Is it really worth moving them?These are the books that nobody seems to want:I have no idea why 'A Romance in Radium' didn't excite the book buyers of the world. People have bought books about condensed milk, electricity substations and concrete, so nothing is too dull to sell. I think some books just drop off the radar. Leisure time has been rather thin on the ground recently, but I was able to have a very enjoyable afternoon tea with a reader of this blog who happened to be on holiday in the UK. Meeting Dale and her husband was a delight and reinforced my positive view of blogging as a means of connecting with like-minded people. It could have been awkward meeting a complete stranger, but everyone I've met has been as likeable and entertaining as their writing, only more so.On the subject of other bloggers, I'd like to thank Kristin at Not Intent on Arriving for inviting me to be interviewed on her blog. I hope I wasn't too dull. I like reading about Kristin's life (although it always makes me realise how dull mine has become) and vicariously enjoy reading about her travels. My wife has just told me that a door has fallen off. I think that's my cue to stop."},

She stopped, took a book from the shelf and shouted \"Antonio! Antonio!\" A few seconds later, a slightly disheveled man in a tweed jacket shuffled across the carpet, saying \"What? Oh yes...Er...Hmphh...\"It was Anthony Burgess. I recognised him immediately, from his many appearances on chat shows.Burgess was the polar opposite of Sallinger*; maddeningly prolific and seemingly incapable of turning down an opportunity to appear on television or write a newspaper article. But, as this appearance on the Dick Cavett Show demonstrates, you can see why the offers kept coming in:* I've been corrected on my spelling of Salinger. My apologies. My wife is always telling me off for not proof-reading what I've written."},
{"title": "The Mother of Invention - A Guide to Genteel Poverty", "date": "Friday, May 23, 2014", "text": "There was a time when my wife and I were able to enjoy meals out and foreign holidays without having to watch every penny we spent. I think it was 1998. Then we ruined it all by having children, one of whom made it impossible for my wife to return to work.Since then, our household income has been pitifully small. However, in some ways our years of genteel poverty have been a very positive experience and I've learned some useful lessons that have made me realise how much money I used to waste. Whether you're poor or just simply mean, I'll think you'll find some of my top tips useful:1. The Mighty TeaspoonDuring a brief period of solvency - I think somebody must have died - I had window blinds installed throughout the house. I wanted curtains, but my wife said that they were 'common'. Within a few months, one of the fittings for a blind came out of the wall, taking a huge chunk of plaster with it, leaving a hole.I needed a way of keeping the blind up until I had time to replaster the wall, but the hole was too large for screws or nails. Then, in a flash of inspiration, I realised that a teaspoon was the answer to all my problems. The long end would fit tightly into the hole and the upward curve of the spoon end would stop the pole of the blind sliding off.It worked so well, I didn't bother to repair the wall for two years.2. The Eco BallIf you already use these, you'll know how wonderful they are.  Instead of using washing powder and selecting a one-hour cycle, you can wash your clothes by using two of these in a short rinse cycle. They save a fortune in washing powder and also use far less water and electricity. I won't bore you with the science, but cheesy socks will smell like a meadow after a mere 15 minutes of washing. I will never buy Bold again.3. The Powerline AdapterThis wonderful little device uses your home's electrical wiring system to send internet data from your router to devices in other rooms. I wanted to watch BBC iPlayer programmes on my ordinary television without having to spend a fortune on a home cinema system or a contract with Sky (Boo! Murdoch!) or Virgin (Tony Blair with a beard), so I bought a couple of these and now enjoy a good quality picture and connection without any additional expense.4. The Broken BlindMy lovely new blinds, all installed by Hillarys, broke rather too quickly. It seemed ridiculous to have to buy a whole new blind just because the cord was broken, but what could I do? Then I had an idea:The cords of these blinds are nearly always synthetic, so I set fire to each end, quickly blew the flames out before the smoke alarm went off and pressed the two molten ends together. As they cooled down, they formed a solid bond which hasn't broken in several years. I would also recommend Lego for blinds, which comes in many shapes and sizes and, when used with superglue, can effectively repair broken plastic fittings.5. The Tester PotIf you have a small bathroom and want to paint a wall the same colour, don't waste money on a £20 pot of paint. Just buy two or three tester pots and that should be all you need. I painted our bathroom for the grand sum of £3.6. The Carpet OffcutUnless you live in a huge house, you can usually find a tasteful offcut that will fit the dimensions of your room. I had a new pure wool carpet professionally installed in our sitting room for under £100.7. The Double-Ended JackAssuming that you have some cheap audio software, if you plug one end of the lead into your headphone socket and the other into the one for the microphone, you can record anything on the internet and turn it into an MP3 file. It's like taping something - remember that? These are just a few of the many money-saving ideas I've discovered and whenever anything breaks, I ask myself one basic question:\"Does it really need to be replaced? Does it even need to be repaired, or will a teaspoon do until around 2017?\"You'd be amazed at the number of times the answer is a teaspoon."},

{"title": "Away With the White Horses", "date": "Saturday, May 17, 2014", "text": "It has been an odd couple of days. Yesterday, a man turned up at work on a white horse, as if he was inviting me to join him on a quest. I would have said yes, but I was busy trying to move ten thousand books to a new building, one car load at a time. I never found out what he wanted. In the evening, a friend casually told us that he had done the voiceover for an advert that was voted the greatest UK television commercial of all time. Why hadn't he mentioned it before? I'm still telling people that I was on BBC Radio Five 14 years ago.This morning I woke up to the sound of horses hooves and as I stood on one leg to place our broken blind in the small gap between the roller and ceiling, I saw some men in chainmail walk past. Then I remembered that it was the 750th anniversary of the Battle of Lewes.The actual anniversary was a few days ago. At least, that's what everyone seems to think, but didn't we change our calendar in 1752 and lose eleven days? Today, the town ground to a halt and a group of volunters recreated the Battle of Lewes, following the original route of 1264:It was all good fun, unlike the original battle. I always mixed feelings at events like these. On the one hand, I enjoy living in a town that cherishes its past (I imagine that in a hundred years' time, Lewes will look almost the same as it does today). But I also feel conscious of being, as the song goes, on the outside looking in. Perhaps I'll never be a Lewesian.But enough of Lewes. This is supposed to be a book blog, so I'll move on to some of my favourite discoveries from last week, beginning with this striking frontispiece:It comes from a 1920s book on aircraft, which was surprisingly worthless. I threw away the book but kept the frontispiece.The next illustration has a very odd caption underneath: \"A quick desperate wriggle and his legs were over the board and the rest of him followed anyhow.\" Well, yes. This illustration is from a rather disturbing 1920s book about the mind:It comes from a chapter called \"Cretins and Dunces\", in which the author expresses view that weren't out of step with the times. The widespread enthusiasm for eugenics shocks us today, but of course it enjoyed a wide range of supporters that included Churchill, H G Wells, Theodore Roosevelt, George Bernard Shaw, John Maynard Keynes, John Harvey Kellogg and Marie Stopes. Finally, two completely bonkers 1960s sci-fi novels:Androids with whips? For some reason, that reminds me of this atrocious song. As for this, perhaps it was a thoughtful novel about eugenics that was given a less than enlightened cover treatment to boost sales. I don't know. I can safely say that I will never read this book to find out."},
{"title": "The Palliser Novels", "date": "Sunday, May 11, 2014", "text": "\"There is no happiness in love, except at the end of an English novel.\"I have just finished the last of Trollope's six Palliser novels - something I wasn't expecting to achieve until I was at least 80. But a recent period of illness required some comfort reading and after enjoying Arnold Bennett's Clayhanger trilogy last year, I was on the lookout for another sequence of novels. The Pallisers fitted the bill perfectly. Compared to Dickens, whose novels seem to inhabit a hyperrreal world of caricatures, Trollope's stories are disarmingly familiar. His characters complain about an unpopular coalition government, bemoan the fact that there are no longer any politicians with charisma and think that the young generation aren't a patch on theirs. Each novel seems to feature the following stock characters:A penniless young man on the makeA young woman who can't decide whether to marry for love or moneyA rich widower who is exasperated by his children's behaviourSomeone called FrankA feisty, outspoken elderly duchess A middle-aged bachelor who's a bit of a chumpA penniless spinster who exists as a 'companion' to an aristocratA man of doubtful social origins who believes that he is a gentlemanA wealthy widow who delights in toying with her suitorsThe Palliser novels are all about money and power. If you have neither, then your only hope is to acquire them through marriage or inheritance. The third option available to young gentlemen - hard work - appears to be too absurd to warrant mentioning.I liked Trollope's ability to create a broad canvas of well-defined characters, whose interactions are portrayed with wit and perception. Trollope writes particularly well for women, showing how they used wit and guile to overcome the restrictions placed on their gender. I didn't like Trollope's anti-semitism, which hit a particularly sour note in the penultimate novel and went far beyond the normal prejudices of mid-Victorian Britain. I also felt that by the fourth book, Trollope was beginning to repeat himself and kept forgetting which novel I was reading.Some might argue that the Palliser novels are a literary Downton Abbey, lacking the breadth of vision that made Dickens such a great writer. But although they may have something of the soap opera about them, Trollope's rich panorama of the upper echelons of mid-Victorian Britain also asks some fundamental questions about the pursuit of happiness. In Trollope's world, love conquers all, but only if it's accompanied by money: \"Love is like any other luxury. You have no right to it unless you can afford it.\" and whilst we, the reader, may feel a warm glow when the wedding bells ring, there is usually at least one character who is left destitute and alone."},
{"title": "A Night Out in 1975", "date": "Monday, May 05, 2014", "text": "\"Hello, is Julie there please? It's Kevin. Thank you... Hello Julie. Fancy a night out in Westcliff? Great! I know this amazing new cinema where there are two different screens! Yes, two...\" It all changed in the mid-70s. Cinema chains dropped the B films and added more screens, but retained old favourites like the asthma-inducing Kio-Ora orange squash and the obligatory Herb Alpert records that preceded the adverts for carpet shops and Indian Restaurants.This 1975 programme for the Classic 1 and 2 in Westcliff-on-Sea was being used as a bookmark:Roger Moore fans were particularly well served, with Gold showing one week and Live and Let Die the next. But the double bills must have been a bit of an endurance course.Diary of a Nymphomaniac probably didn't live up to the promise of its title and I can imagine an afternoon matinee in an almost empty cinema, with a smattering of disappointed middle-aged men in gannex raincoats.But if you prefer films for adults to adult films, I can thoroughly recommend Sunday Bloody Sunday. A Ken Russell double bill seems an optimistic choice for Southend, but perhaps audiences were more receptive to serious drama (and gratuitous nudity) in the age before multi-channel television. If you could go back to 1975 and sit in the third row, with the smoke drifting across from the right hand side of the auditorium, which of these films would you pick?"},
{"title": "The Imperfect Family", "date": "Saturday, May 03, 2014", "text": "Yesterday, my wife and I took our oldest son to Harley Street in search of a definitive answer to a question that has remained unresolved for nearly a decade. After two hours of gruelling questions, the diagnosis was uneqivocal: Asperger's syndrome. Suddenly, everything fell into place. In many ways I feel relieved. My son will now hopefully get the help he needs and my wife and I will no longer be blamed for his problems. However, I feel sad that so many years have been wasted. I wish that I'd been more assertive with the succession of professionals who implied that my wife and I were neurotic parents, making a fuss over nothing. Perhaps my son could have been spared a lot of unnecessary suffering.This morning we walked to Landport Bottom, where the town is celebrating the 750th anniversary of the Battle of Lewes. It may not look terribly exciting, but the events that took place here changed the course of history: My older son stayed at home. His younger brother staged a silent protest, refusing to take his hood down and I wondered what we must look like. Occasionally, people would greet us with a breathy \"Hi! How are you? What have you been up to?\" We smiled back and said \"Oh, nothing much...\"I watched some children dancing around a Maypole and tried to imagine either of my sons taking part in a group activity:The field was surrounded by stalls. Children were laughing at a Punch and Judy show, whilst mothers in medieval costume were preparing some craft activities. Everyone seemed to be inhabiting a different, happier world to us and I felt as if I was passing through like a ghost. But of course this was nonsense. I looked around me again and saw a woman with a life-threatening illness, a friend whose mother had just been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and a neighbour whose husband had recently left her for another woman. Beneath the surface, most of us are struggling in one way or another, smiling for the camera.The happy world of perfect families only exists in Ladybird books. And sometimes even Ladybird lets us down."},
{"title": "A Colourful Victorian Childhood", "date": "Wednesday, April 30, 2014", "text": "I found a small card today that was being used as a bookmark in a rather dull memoir by a Victorian clergyman. It was between pages 26 and 27, suggesting that the reader hadn't progressed any further.One side contained this cheerful image:The other had this appeal for donations to the 'Incorporated Society for Providing Homes for Waifs and Strays':Emigration seems a rather extreme measure, but the average Victorian orphan would have probably fared better in the colonies than the damp, smog-ridden streets of the East End.  The memoir with the Waifs and Strays slip turned out to be the first of a batch of Victorian books that included a selection of 'penny dreadfuls', a couple of titles by John Ruskin and a battered copy of a children's poetry collection from 1868. As I picked it up, the poetry book fell apart in my hands. I tried to reassemble the pages and found these appealing colour illustrations:(I'm not sure why there's a sinister-looking stranger in the background)As for the poems themselves, they covered cheerful subjects like death, deformity and poverty. Take this, for example:Not something you'd want to read to your child at bedtime. But in an age in which infant mortality was a common experience, poems like these sought to bring comfort, albeit in a rather maudlin, sentimental fashion.The poems also hark back to a pre-industrial rural idyll, evoking a world that still exists in the popular imagination: cottages with roses around the door, the hum of bees on a summer's afternoon, the church spire of a distant village, a babbling woodland stream and a carpet of bluebells. There are no factory chimneys or back to back houses. Young readers may have been deemed able to cope with the grim realities of death and disease, but some subjects were clearly beyond the pale."},

{"title": "A Bent Copper", "date": "Wednesday, April 23, 2014", "text": "What, you may ask, is so interesting about this 1898 photograph? It's just a Victorian woman crossing a road with a dog. The answer is that it was taken by Zola, when he fled to London during the Dreyfus Affair. We see lots of photos of authors, but this is the first I can think of that is by one. I've tried to find other examples, but Google has drawn a blank. I don't know whether Zola employed any domestic staff during his stay in London, but he may have perused these advertisements:I'm intrigued by the stipulation of \"no fringe\" in a couple of adverts and the promise of beer in others.  Can anyone enlighten me about the fringe issue? Are fringes a sign of bad character?Talking of bad characters, another gem from the 1890s I found recently is a memoir of policing in Victorian Manchester. The book looks like a good read, but the main attraction is the author's name:I don't know if this joke travels well. Do they have \"bent coppers\" outside the UK? I expect that Superintendent Bent would have been able to quickly identify the ne'er-do-wells in this 1892 photo. My money's on the boy with the peaked cap, who looks as if he's contemplating an illegal act. I'm sure the sight of the Superintendent would have been enough to strike fear into the hearts of most criminals. Just look at him:Only these habitual bad'uns would have been impervious to the long arm of the law:But in spite of Bent's stern countenance, he was a compassionate man whose sense of justice included a committment to improve the living conditions of the poor. Today, in Trafford, there is a blue plaque that reads:\"Superintendent James Bent established a soup kitchen in this vicinity in 1878 feeding thousands of people and potentially saving them from starvation.\"Bent coppers aren't what they used to be.Finally, a frontispiece illustration from an annual that has nothing to do with the 1890s, but I like the image:Don't you?"},
{"title": "Nuns, Nudes and Nomads", "date": "Thursday, April 17, 2014", "text": "At my old storage unit, I used to be able to gauge what time of the year it was by the volume of mud, flies and excrement. I became resigned to the mud,  gradually accepting that washing my car was a completely futile task. But I never got used to the flies.For some reason, my car was a fly-magnet and on some days I counted over 50, before giving up in despair. Whenever I opened the car door, several flies would sneak inside and hide, waiting until I'd reached a critical speed on the journey home. I nearly crashed on several occasions, trying to steer with one hand and swat with the other.My new premises appear to be fly and mud-free. Also, I can now watch the seasons change. This is how the view has altered during the last few weeks:I'm looking forward to having my lunch breaks by the lake.During today's trip to work, I found a collection of the Photography Year Book from the late 1950s and early 60s. As a schoolboy I used to avidly pour through copies of these at the local library (mainly because they contained photographs of naked ladies), but hadn't looked at one for years. I'd forgotten how each collection had the same recurring subjects.Here are a few of those themes:1. The Still Life:I didn't like them when I was 13. I'm not that keen now, although I've learned that if I'm with people in a gallery, I must say something positive about the \"form\" and \"composition\" rather than risk exposing myself as a complete philistine. \"I like the interplay between the horizontal and verticle leaves...\"2. The Very Wrinkled Old Person:There was a time when no widow in an Italian hill town could safely go to confession without being assailed by a photographer, who would then bundle her into a pensione and take a series of unflattering portraits. As much as I like the lined face and knowing eyes, it has become something of a cliché.3. The Naked Lady Landscape Shot:Yes, it's a nude woman. But she's imitating a natural feature on a beach or in a national park and she's not wearing saucy underwear, so this is a serious photograph. Isn't it?4. The Special Effects Study:They say \"I achieved this effect by using a 200mm lense at f/5 and a halogen flash at a shutter speed of 1/4...\" and all I can think is, was it worth it? Trees at night-time.5. Some People in a Third World Country:  These pictures were a doddle, once you'd convinced the subjects that the camera wasn't stealing their souls.The people would either be naked or wearing outlandish clothing, so a successful photograph was almost guaranteed. These days, you'll have to ask the subjects to removed their Nike t-shirts for a few minutes.6. A Picture of an Animal:You may say that it's just a picture of a sparrow in the grass, but apparently it's good enough to be published. Perhaps sparrows are hard to photograph. 8. A Photograph of Anything, As Long As It Features a Nun:Beyond the usual themes of nuns, nudity, abstract compositions and old people I found a few pictures that I really liked. Here is a small selection:Nurses praying? I'm very relieved that none of my nurses had to turn to prayer when I was in hospital a couple of months ago. I enjoyed looking at the work of so many gifted photographers, but what struck me most was how commonplace the exotic images of Chinese peasants, African tribeswomen and Arab nomads appeared, while the once mundane pictures of British miners and city gents in bowler hats seemed extraordinary. How times have changed."},
{"title": "Miss Perkins, Bulgarians, Town Planning and the Blitz", "date": "Sunday, April 06, 2014", "text": "Winter was awful. I was ill for the best part of three months and consumned more antibiotics than a supermarket chicken. But I've been gradually recovering during the last few weeks and have worked like the clappers to make up for lost time. It seems to be paying off.I've been working through a delivery of books that has an enjoyably ecclectic range of titles. Here are a few that caught my eye:I'm a big fan of the coloured frontispieces in old children's novels. Often they are the only illustration in the book and have to entice a potential reader with a scene of mild peril. Girls tend to be standing outside a study, waiting to be upbraided, whilst boys can usually been seen hiding from an assailant, who is either an angry master, foreign agent or beligerent farm labourer.The caption for the above picture is \"Miss Perkins looked straight at the girls\". It would be a Miss Perkins.But it was a very different age, as this book below reminds us:I Googled this book title and ended up with some pictures of a number of very healthy looking young men with George Michael beards.  They all looked very cheerful and for a brief moment, I wondered if I would have been a happier person if I was a gay Bulgarian. I'll never know.The next book that appealed is this 1960s educational title:The book purports to give an unbiased overview of the development of towns and cities, but 50 years on, it seems ridiculously prejudiced. Like many other books and television programmes of the time, it has a blind faith in planning and modernism as the saviours of mankind. For example, the illustration below has this caption:\"A modern town does not grow up accidentally. It is carefully planned so that we can enjoy living in it.\"The reality, of course, is quite different. Most people prefer living in a town that has evolved slowly over time, in response to people's needs, rather than the soulless creation of priggish idealogues, avaricious businessmen and corrupt councillors. The text claims that these concrete buildings \"are pleasant to look at.\" Really?The most striking book I found today was a collection of photographs from the Second World War. Apparently, this picture of blind children in a shelter during an air raid was voted the favourite war photo by readers of an American magazine in 1943. I'm not surprised. It is a powerful image that still shocks and upsets:The photo below is also very moving. This was taken after an air raid in Sussex, during which 20 children were killed at a school:\"And finally...\"Like the news, it's usually best to end on a lighter note, so I'll finish with this nice juxtaposition of a theatre poster and a bombed-out building:"},
{"title": "Rambling", "date": "Tuesday, April 01, 2014", "text": "My oldest son's favourite new word is hypocrite and it's usually levelled at me. Most of the time he's confusing flexibility with double standards, but sometimes he's spot on. I was a complete hypocrite last week, when I took my sons to a 'drive-thru' McDonalds, after years of condemning the company's food and working practices, but I knew that they'd love it.On the way back to Lewes, my younger son said that he felt sick and I pulled over into a side road,  where we found ourselves next to a church in a small hamlet. There are quite a few churches in England that sit in isolated places and don't appear to serve any community. Some villages never recovered from the Black Death, whilst others simply withered over time.We got out and walked around, hoping that fresh air would help my son. On a nearby tree, we found this:It reminded me of the film The Longest Day. I've no idea why the teddy bear was caught in a tree.The church, surrounded by daffodils, recalled the rural idyll that appeared on my parents' 'This England' calendars. But as we approached the church, we found something rather unpleasant:Once we were back in Lewes, I began sifting through boxes of secondhand books. I rarely find old photographs since I became self-employed, so I was delighted when I found these:As usual, there were no names or dates. It's frustrating, but also tantalising. The same pile of books also yielded this early colour plate from a 'penny dreadful' published by the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. The SPCK must have published thousands of novels for younger readers, as I always find several a day. Like Mills and Boon romance novels, they follow a strict template and I've noticed that temperance is a recurring theme.Alcoholism appears to have been a big issue in the 1880s and 90s. My great-grandfathers on my mother's side were both late Victorian drunkards, with numerous illegitimate children. My mother remembers her long-suffering grandmother saying \"When 'ee dies, I want to 'ave three years to meself.\"Her wish came true. The husband died in the early 1940s and my great-grandmother was determined to have her three years: \"Hitler's not gonna get me. I'm 'aving me time.\" She survived many air raids and died just over three years to the day after her husband's death.The culture of self-improvement and temperance appears to have had a strong influence on the following generation, as my mother's parents (and many of their peers) were strict teetotalers. In the history of our family, I see myself as a Charles II figure, restoring the traditional merry-making after a period of austere puritanism. But without the illegitimate children and gambling.The following day, I worked through another collection of books and found this touching note, written by a young girl:\"I am going to save up for a 1/2d light colourd lipstick and a small box of Ponds Powder if mummy will let me, a small scotch red purse for my red handbag and the Penguins Club badge before it starts again.\"I hope that I'll find more notes and photographs in books. but failing that, I can look in other places, like this wall in Ilfracombe:I'll take their word for it."},

After 15 minutes of failed attempts, we were warned of \"special procedures\" that would cause the lights and doors to stop working for a few seconds.Reading between the lines, I realised that they were doing what the rest of us do when something doesn't work. They turned the train off, counted to five and turned it on again. It worked.Once the train had rebooted, the doors hissed open and allowed the remaining people on the platform to get on. One of them was a rather plain, overweight woman in her late 30s. She was unremarkable in every way, apart from a fully tattooed face, a bright yellow bobble hat and a Modrianesque poncho. Nobody seemed to bat an eyelid.I was returning from a trip to the Science Museum with my younger son, who wanted to learn about materials and pollution. We looked at several exhibits that showed how many things come from oil, including airfix kits and bath tubs. When I answered any questions, I made sure that there were no adults within earshot who could hear my half-baked ideas.My older son also has an occasional interest in science. Yesterday he saw a YouTube video which claimed that if you shook a cola bottle vigorously, then put it in the freezer for three hours and 15 minutes, you would have fizzy iced cola. Three hours and 30 minutes later, I heard a voice shout \"Dad! Dad!\"I had no idea that an exploding bottle of Coca Cola could cover such a large area. Both the floor and ceiling were soaked in cola, plus half of the walls, a computer, three chairs, a watercolour painting, a window, several books and a printer. The ceiling still bears the stains, but they add a pleasingly antique, mottled effect to the Victorian plasterwork.After the long clean-up operation, I asked my son why he hadn't opened the bottle in the garden. I was assured that the experiment had worked perfectly in the video. Ah yes, I thought, the infallible wisdom of YouTube. But perhaps I can employ this blind faith to my own ends. If I can write a list of all the things that annoy me (like beginning sentences with \"So...\") and make videos that convince today's teenagers that these practices will result in terrible consequences, I will have made up for the Coca Cola incident.My first video will be about tattooed faces."},

That sounds wonderful.\"At this point, I always wonder if I should shatter their illusion and tell them my job actually involves sifting through thousands of manky, charity shop rejects in search of a small number of gems, whilst trying not to gag at the overpowering smell of manure. I've had enough of this place, so I'm leaving.I'll be moving to a new farm shortly. It's drier, cleaner and I won't have to contend with bulls, mud or surly, limbless people. I went to set up some shelving in the new unit this morning. I was only there for an hour, but during that time over 20 horse-drawn carts went past. Had I stumbled across a clandestine Amish community in the heart of Sussex?It felt particularly disconcerting, as only 12 hours earlier I was here:I went with my wife to a concert at the Royal Festival Hall, where a choral piece by Neil Hannon had been commissioned to show off its newly-restored organ.My wife hates organ music, but likes Neil Hannon. I love organs and Neil Hannon, so I had to go. We used to feel so at home at the South Bank, but my wife and I now feel as if we're in Bladerunner (\"The adverts have moving pictures!\"). Our psychogeographical map of London is 15 years out of date.Where's the Wimpy Bar?The concert was a mixed affair. The highlight was Vaughan Williams' sublime Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis and a very moving performance of Dear Lord and Father of Mankind by Neil Hannon. I'm not a big fan of hymns, but this arrangement was beautiful:I wasn't as keen on Neil Hannon's own composition, which sounded like a pastiche of Philip Glass and John Adams. The libretto was very witty, but like most minimalist music, it relied too much on repetition rather than development. It's a pity, as Hannon is one of the most gifted songwriters alive. When he allowed his own voice to come to the fore, in the final movement, the music was far more successful.I enjoyed the concert, but the best part of the evening was simply being able to go out with my wife and meet a friend. During the last few years we have been held hostage by our oldest son's condition and our world has shrunk. We haven't even bothered renewing our passports, as it seems like an unnecessary expense. I find it hard to believe that I once went off to Chile on a whim.In Chile, on a whim and a bicycle."},
{"title": "With Deepest Sympathy", "date": "Thursday, March 20, 2014", "text": "I found a rather poignant letter in a book today, used as a bookmark in a D. E. Stevenson novel. In just a few lines, it tells a story that many will be familiar with:My dear Minnie,Thank you for your letter. I was so sorry to hear your sad news of Joanna and I send you our love and sympathy. I know what you must be going through.I have lost quite a few of my friends lately, it is the penalty of growing old! I have settled in quite well but I miss my animals, as I am not allowed any here.My love to Jane. I expect she is a great comfort to you. I will keep in touch again.Much love,Pam.It has been a long winter. Laid low by a succession of illnesses, I stayed indoors for three months, existing on a diet of antibiotics, Breaking Bad and Anthony Trollope. Deprived of sunlight, my skin took on the pallid quality of a Morlock.A few days ago I decided that it was time to go out and drove to a nearby medieval priory, where I hoped that the monkish reasonances might have a restorative effect. I think it worked.Just to the right of this picture is Ye Olde Gifte Shoppe, selling the usual nonsense. You can visit any historic building in Britain and find the same things: tea towels, mugs, 'local' biscuits, CDs of pseudo-Celtic music, small jars of preserves, a pewter replica of something, a book that's £5 cheaper on Amazon and some pencils.Sadly, they don't sell any of these:I must have been corrupted by television, as I orginally read this as 'Joan Rivers'.As we walked past a pond of copulating frogs, I realised how good it felt to be outside again. I must get some more exercise and build my stamina up, as I have quite a few challenges ahead of me. Annoyingly, I can't write about any of them.I will therefore finish this brief slip of a post with a piece of First World War propaganda that caught my eye:I wonder if this was the point at which the sartorial rot began to set in?"},
{"title": "The Curious Case of the Ejaculating Airman", "date": "Monday, March 10, 2014", "text": "I have a publishing-related question that I hope somebody may be able to answer. In a nutshell, I'm interested in the possibility of republishing a small number of titles that are no longer in print but are still, I believe, in copyright. In the case of one, the author died in the 1950s and the publisher no longer exists, so how would I go about getting permission to print a new edition?During the last few years, I've come across a small number of titles that are extremely popular and sell within hours of being listed, even when their condition is poor. Judging by the prices, the demand clearly exceeds the supply, so I wonder if a reissue would be justified.If anyone reading this has a clue, I'd be grateful for any information. I know that it's easy enough to print e-book versions and paperbacks of out of copyright titles, but I'm baffled by the logistics of rights management.I've noticed that publishers are wisely digitising their backlists, bringing many out of print titles back into circulation, although there are still big gaps (for example, why isn't J M Coetzee's Life and Times of Michael K available in Kindle format?).I wonder if this Percy F Westerman Boy's Own adventure will ever be republished?The War of the Wireless Waves is a tale of plucky chaps doing battle with swarthy 'super-bandits', who are after Britain's Z and ZZ rays. What's so special about these rays, you may ask? Apparently, they can knock-out an aeroplane's engine in mid-flight, sending it plummeting to the ground. I haven't actually read the book, but a cursory glance reveals a fast-paced story that makes Biggles look like an old hippie.Percy Westerman clearly knows how to tell a story, but he does have a slightly disturbing obsession with having his characters ejaculate at regular intervals:These are just a few examples of the many ejaculations that occur in this book. I realise that ejaculate used to be such a lovely word, but even if its usage is a little more specific these days, I still wonder why Westerman eschewed old favourites like exclaimed. Nobody ejaculates in Trollope, so I'm not convinced that Westerman is simply using the argot of late-Victorian England.A Percy F Westerman revival probably isn't on the cards, but he's still worth reading - quickly - to give an insight into the Britain of 90 years ago, when Z rays and ejaculations threatened the very fabric of Empire."},

As a result, he know nothing about the Wars of the Roses or the Industrial Revolution, but is becoming something of an expert on 9/11 conspiracy theories, UFOs and cats that look like Hitler. He's also good at hacking, so it's probably only a matter of time before he's extradited to the US.I've been trying to make him think more critically about the information he finds on the internet, questioning the sources and asking what their motivation is. It's been an uphill struggle, but I'm glad that he now accepts that the moon landings were genuine.The internet is a minefield of lies and half truths. Many of us are able to negotiate it successfully, but the more vulnerable struggle to separate truth from fiction. It doesn't help when companies that we trust lie to us. Sometimes the lies are easy to spot. This display in Tesco, which I tweeted last week, is one of the most absurd things I've seen for a long time:I would love to know how this nonsense got to the stage of being signed off and printed. Do we even want passionate people to prepare our food? As one person commented, \"I'm not sure which sort of passion would be worse. If they're angry they'll have spat in it, if they're amorous, well....\"Aside from the fact that passion is a bit foreign, I'm also concerned that Tesco are violating Equal Opportunites legislation, discriminating against those who are unable to feel strongly about manufacturing yogurt. The Tesco example is crude and obvious. Other lies are more subtle, such as these depictions of helpline employees:Apparently, when we phone call centres, we will speak to attractive, slim, middle class people who can't wait to speak to us. Perhaps they're smiling because they know that the caller has just been listening to a loop of Richard Clayderman for 37 minutes. The adverts never feature anyone who is fat, depressed, ugly or scruffy and the employees are shown sitting in rows in a light, airy office. In reality, people are treated like battery hens, squashed into tiny cubicles in a noisy room with no natural light or fresh air. It's not quite the Lancashire mills, but it's still pretty awful that anyone should have to spend 40 hours a week working somewhere like here:I've never quite trusted corporate websites after an experience with this company, in the pre-internet era:In the 1990s, I constantly received catalogues from a UK stationery company called Viking. Unlike most junk mail, I used to enjoy browsing through the contents because at various points, a man called Ian Helford would be shown using the products. In the illustration above, Ian is merely pointing, but it got more exciting inside and he could be seen in a variety of positions, carrying boxes, labelling shelves or testing a broom. I began to develop a mild fascination for this publicity-shy businessman in his 60s and envisaged him speaking with a slight London accent and living in a vulgar new mansion in Billericay.You can imagine my horror when I discovered that it was all a fiction.On a trip to the US, I saw a Viking catalogue on a table. \"It's good to see a British company doing well in the US\" I thought, and decided to have a look. Ian was on the front page, pointing at some A4 paper, but in this catalogue he was called Irwin. Who was this man? Further investigation proved that Ian really was Irwin and that rather than being a British company doing well in the US, Viking was as American as apple pie. 'Ian' didn't live in Billericay, but if the portrait below is anything to go by, he did live in a vulgar mansion:I can see why Irwin Helford was 'rebranded' for Viking's entry into the UK stationery market. Irwin is one of those very American names, like Elmer, Chuck or Hank that would have identified the business as a global corporation. Ian Helford was a local man. Someone you could pick up the phone and do business with. It was a fib. In fairness, Viking never clained that Mr Helford was British, but by changing his name there was an element of disguise. As internet usage grew, Viking wisely changed this to 'I. Helford' .These days, there's no excuse for ignorance. With the click of a few buttons, it's possible to find out that Innocent smoothies is now owned by Coca-Cola and that Starbucks is guilty of tax avoidance in the UK. But we have to learn how to use the internet.I'm concerned that my son's critical faculties aren't being developed. I do what I can to discuss things with him, but teenage boys aren't naturally inclined to listen to their fathers. Ideally, he'd be able to discuss issues in a classroom environment, but my son's school have admitted that they don't know what to do with him and his days are now spent indoors. With no qualifications, my son's job prospects will be grim. But as he has displayed an aversion to daylight and fresh air, preferring to spend his time hunched in front of a screen, maybe there's a position waiting for him at the nearest call centre. He's also quite passionate, so perhaps Tesco would be interested too. But I'm not giving up yet. I hear that they're paying people who know how to do coding up to £18 an hour, so I think I'll put the call centre on hold. Who knows, in a few years' time, my son could be richer than I've ever been."},

I'm fully aware that it is a routine, relatively trivial problem, but after last month's appendectomy I feel as if I'm being slowly disassembled. My slightly melodramatic response is probably a reaction to the recent illnesses of friends, a setback with my older son and an approaching 'special' birthday. But I need to remember that these are isolated events, not part of some divine plan to punish me for stealing paper from school when I was eight.Assuming that no further bodily parts are removed, I intend to begin a regime of regular exercise and healthy food before I end up looking like Homer Simpson. Ideally, I'd spend a week or two in a Swiss resort, where I could enjoy the mountain air and go hiking with a guide called Erich. Interlaken is supposed to be rather pleasant in the spring and has been a popular destination ever since it was 'discovered' in the 19th century.There don't appear to be many photos of Victorian hikers - the cameras were rather cumbersome in those days - but one enterprising gentleman in Interlaken came up with an ingenious solution:With the aid of fake grass, a cardboard rock and a misty background, the beauty of the Swiss mountains were flawlessly recreated by Johann Adam Gabler. Whether you were a seasoned mountaineer or an indolent aesthete, the results were the same.This is one of Gabler's more realistic shots, carefully staged to recreate the tension and excitement of hunting. But not every portrait was this successful:The attention to detail was sadly lacking in this photo, as Herr Gabler's fakery is clearly visible. If only he'd moved the camera a few degrees to the left.A happy honeymoon couple, still glowing from a night of passionate lovemaking. This costume is a cut above the average electric blue Berghaus kagool. Half 'Brown Owl', half Italian revolutionary.I don't think it would be unfair to say that this chap, who looks a little like Debussy, is a stranger to the outdoor life. Even the rigours of the studio scenery are too much for him and he has wisely opted for a more sedate, arcadian setting. It's so antisocial when people keep checking their Bibles for a text. The friend is clearly not impressed by her companion's behaviour.This is a splendid outfit compared to the shapeless, synthetic hiking gear of today. The act of getting dressed must have been a pleasure in itself. However, I'm not sure how this gentleman's clothes would have fared in a downpour.After looking at these photos, the answer is clear: I need a large sum of money, a time machine and a valet. I'm sure that a week in the 1880s, hobnobbing with minor royals and exiled aristocrats, would restore my equilibrium, so that I could tackle the rest of the year with renewed vigour.But until time travel is invented I have this, which is the next best thing:"},

I find those chunky, macho 'Great American Novel' candidates as unreadable as the effete sub-Iris Murdoch stories that are populated with characters called Rupert, Gertrude and Axel. I also struggle to appreciate those 'lyrical' novels by Commonwealth writers that specialise in lengthy descriptions of fruit and grandparents.On the other hand, give me a novel in translation by a Hungarian author or a recent winner of the Prix Goncourt and I'm an avid reader.

{"title": "A Man of the Cloth", "date": "Wednesday, February 12, 2014", "text": "The other evening, while my wife and I were having dinner with some friends, the conversation moved onto the subject of youthful innocence in the age of the internet. We all agreed about the present, but couldn't decide whether our generation were really so naive. Then I remembered something that happened nearly 30 years ago.When I was a student in Wales, the landlord of my local pub asked me if I'd be interested in doing some bar work when the National Eisteddfod was held in town during the summer. I had some reservations. The Eisteddfod was the epicentre of Welsh nationalism. I was very English and my knowledge of Welsh was limited to talking about the weather and telling people that I liked coffee.However, with the recklessness of youth, I said yes. It would be an experience. One that hopefully wouldn't include being beaten up by irate Welsh speakers. I needn't have worried. On the first day I discovered that any anti-English sentiment was eclipsed by a bizarre animosity between the Welsh from the north and those from the south. As people realised I was English, they seemed keen to convince me how awful the other part of Wales was: \"You see, they think they speak better Welsh than us, but when they say like, they should say hoffi, not licio...\"Once I learned that even the most ardent nationalists were friendlier than many English people, I began to relax and found the company invigorating, particularly that of one man. He was a vicar in his 50s who worked in a boys' home and although he drank a ridiculous amount of beer, it didn't affect his ability to talk with great clarity about Welsh culture and history. At one point in the evening, he looked worried. \"Oh, I don't know if I should drive back to my bed and breakfast in Llanllwni. It's 15 miles and I've had 12 pints. What do you think, eh?\"As the pub landlord had given me a guest room with twin beds, it seemed only right to offer the spare bed to the drunken vicar. He seemed surprised and delighted. I congratulated myself on doing the right thing.An hour later we went up to the room, where we removed our shirts and trousers and got into our respective beds. The lights were turned off and apart from a purple glow of static from the nylon sheets, the room was completely black and eerily silent. Then, after a minute, I heard a voice in the dark: \"Do you mind if I masturbate?\"I had no idea how to reply and heard myself say \"No, but I'm just going out for a while.\" I walked down the corridor, locked myself in the bathroom and stayed there until half an hour had passed. When I returned, the vicar was snoring like a sedated bull.Annoyingly, the following morning he'd asked the landlord's permission to use my room for the rest of the week and I was too embarrassed to object. After all, nothing had happened, had it? I spent the next five days being keep awake by the most extraordinary snoring I've ever encountered.As far as the laying on of hands was concerned, I stayed in the television room and watched 'V' until I felt confident that the good Rev. Davies had passed out.At one point I wondered if I was simply being priggish about an alcohol-induced episode of onanism, but my unwanted roommate later made remarks to friends that were rather disturbing and confirmed my fears. This wasn't just a drunk, sexually frustrated cleric, but a man who seemed to have a penchant for the young and vulnerable.This episode reminded me just how different our social mores were in the pre-internet era. When the man told me that he was a vicar who worked in a boys' home, I took it as a cast-iron guarantee of good character. Today, my naivety seems absurd. But it wasn't unusual and it enabled clergymen, relatives and a number of entertainers to abuse the trust they enjoyed from the public. When I feel depressed by my older son's knowledge of some of the less pleasant aspects of life, I remind myself that he is also less likely to have awkward encounters with masturbating vicars and dodgy relatives."},

I'm not surprised, as I've felt too tired to do much since my appendix was whipped out, other than read Trollope and watch 'Breaking Bad'.How long does it take to fully recover from surgery? My mother-in-law confidently asserted that it was one week per hour of surgery, but I'm not convinced. This week I made a concerted effort to put some more books on sale. Fortunately, I've now reached a point where I have valued so many different titles, I can instantly identify the books that are of no value. This saves a lot of time, but the ratio of valuable to worthless books is still depressingly low.If I open a box of random pre-ISBN books, I'm also certain that it will contain at least one copy of the following:Little Women,The Ascent of EverestHeidiAnything by DickensThe Rose AnnualVariable Winds at Jalna, by Mazo de la RocheRogue HerriesThe Pilgrim's ProgressA Famous Five bookA late Victorian 'penny dreadful', published by the Society for Promoting Christian KnowledgeWhat Katy DidOver two dozen Companion Book Club/Readers' Union hardbacksA 1920s title about book-keepingThe Wooden HorsePopski's Private ArmyA reference book published by OdhamsSomething by or about George Bernard ShawHeute Abend! Book OneThe Wind in the WillowsI could go on, but I'm sure you'd rather I didn't.Any title that isn't familiar gives a little skip to the heart, particularly if it isn't published by Rupert Hart-Davis (for some reason, nearly all of their books are worthless). Perhaps this will be the book that pulls me back from the brink of penury. I type in the details and press enter. It is worth 61p.But sometimes I am pleasantly surprised:This signed first edition by the author of 'Goodbye Mr Chips' was a refreshing change from finding yet another novel by Storm Jameson and sold at auction for a couple of hundred quid. Even on a bad day, I can usually rely on finding a title that will provide some harmless peurile amusement:(I wonder if they have cottaging in the USA? I only ask because I once had a terrible time trying to explain the concept of a public toilet to a San Francisco cafe owner. He assured me that they didn't exist in America, but this seems unlikely.)I was also amused by these covers:I can only suppose that a 'slapper' was something different then, but I find it hard to believe that the book I found yesterday - a 1930s Encyclopaedia of Sex by someone called A. Willy - didn't raise a smirk in the publisher's office.I also find titles that provide surprisingly pertinent information. For example, after my recent rant about house prices ruining the 'dreaming suburb' of Teddington, I came across this:\"In some London districts it is reckoned that more than one quarter of the inhabitants change their address each year.\" That quote from a late Victorian book called 'The Problems of Poverty' by John Hobson reminded me that London's population has been in a constant state of flux since the Industrial Revolution and that the seemingly unchanging world of postwar Teddington was just a brief interlude.However, although it's good to find titles that interest or amuse, I need to derive an income from my books. Every month I have to pay for stock, plus the rent, postage and commission fees. Whatever's left over is my wage. Last month it reached a new low.Between recovering from an operation and dealing with a child with 'special needs' (I hate that phrase, but can't think of an alternative), it has been a struggle to deal with a backlog of work. This month, I hope to make up for lost time and perhaps in the process, I may find some more gems.On the other hand, I may just find books like this:If the bookselling doesn't work out, maybe I'll become a nylon pirate."},

Who was the person behind these blantantly racist images? Ironically, they were created by a man who was a prominent anti-fascist; a Jew whose work had been banned by the Nazis. In the 1930s, Walter Trier emigrated to Britain and during the War, helped to produce anti-Nazi proganda material. He later emigrated to Canada, where some of his work is now exhibited in the Art Gallery of Ontario.It seems odd that a man who was illustrating anti-Nazi posters was also working on this book, creating images that would now be regarded as offensive as the Third Reich posters featuring big-nosed Jews. But life is full of contradictions, isn't it.Here is a more appealing example of Trier's work:"},
{"title": "Teddington - a Dreary, Overpriced Suburb?", "date": "Wednesday, January 29, 2014", "text": "FOREWORD - This blog post ruffled a few feathers. Regular readers know that my writing is usually tongue-in-cheek, so please take this piece with a large pinch of salt.In the 19th century, a rural Thameside village called Teddington underwent a huge transformation into a suburb of London, as the city's population increased sixfold. Fields and meadows were swallowed up by street after street of semi-detached villas, artisans' cottages and parades of shops.It was part of a process that was happening all over the outskirts of London, as the gaps between villages were filled with parallel roads of redbrick semis. In this new suburbia there were no longer any boundaries. Teddington suddenly turned into Twickenham or Hampton, depending on which direction you walked in.I was born in Teddington in the 1960s and spent the first 25 years of my life there. Then, one day, I realised that it was time to pack my bags and go somewhere a little more exciting. I moved to Twickenham.This is where I caught the bus to my new life, a mile away:I wonder how many hundreds of hours I have spent at this bus stop in Teddington's Waldegrave Road (the slightly improbable birthplace of Noel Coward) waiting for a glimpse of red in the far distance. I dread to think. Sometimes I'd wait for over half an hour, before two or three 270s appeared at the same time. The drivers had probably decided to ignore the timetable and have breakfast together at Fulwell bus depot. Nobody ever complained.In some ways, the bus stop photo sums up Teddington for me. The sense of waiting for something to happen; that life is elsewhere.I've been thinking a lot about Teddington recently after I had an amicable difference of opinion with @TLTeddington on Twitter, who had objected to my description of it in the latest Crap Towns book. I'd described the town as a \"very dreary, overpriced suburb\", which had prompted the following comments: \"The cheeky 'bar stewards'. We know how lovely it is and what a great place it is to live!\"\"Clearly have never set foot in the town. we should invite them for lunch at Retro or any of the other great places. Idiot.\"\"We have are fortunate to have a thriving town centre filled with lovely independent shops, not a cloned town.\"@TLTeddington also posted an image of this manifesto:It all looked very inspring, but was this the same Teddington that I grew up in? In some ways it was - we certainly shopped locally. Up until the mid-70s, when Bruce Forsyth opened a new Tesco supermarket, all of our food shopping took place in corner shops where everyone knew me by name. It was like being in a Ladybird book.My mother and I walked everywhere, as we couldn't afford the bus. In Stanley Road there was the Chinese butcher, who sadly died of a heart attack in his early 40s, a hairdresser's where my mother had her 'perm' and the Friend Shop, where a man would cut slices of processed ham with egg in the middle for us. Vegetables were either bought from a greengrocer run by two brothers in Waldegrave Road, or a shop in Broad Street where a mynah bird called Bobby would greet me with a loud \"'Allo!\".Sometimes, as a special treat, we would walk up to Teddington Model Shop, where there was a coin-operated miniature railway in the window. The slot for the large, pre-decimal pennies remained long after the model shop had been replaced by a video rental business.It seemed a quiet and benign world, where the pace of change was reassuringly slow and many people had lived in their homes for decades. We knew most of the people in our part of the road, either by their surnames or by some distinguishing feature: The German lady, The Irish family, The Lady with the son that makes the noises, The Woman with the beard and The Man with no thumbs. One woman had lived in her house since 1899:Mrs Plutheroe, aged 103, in 2002Our immediate neighbours included two German Jewish sisters, neither of whom hinted at their tragic past, a retired couple I knew as Auntie and Uncle Fuller, and a gentleman in his 70s called Mr Gifford, who took his 1930s Austin Seven out for a spin once a year. There was very little traffic, so in the summer I would play in the street with the local kids, only returning when it was too dark to see. In hindsight, it seems strange to think that the centre of London was just over ten miles away, because Teddington felt very different, like a sleepy, provincial town. I've tried to find some photos that capture the essence of Teddington as I remember it, but only came across a few snapshots. I suppose it wouldn't have occured to me to take photos of that ordinary, everyday world that has now disappeared.Bushy Park. Much nicer than Richmond Park.Teddington Woolworths, where my mother sold Pick 'n' Mix (known by the local schoolchildren as \"Pick 'n' Nick\") to the stars.Outside my house in Church Road (I'm the poncey-looking one on the left)Looking at the 'Live Totally, Shop Locally' manifesto, it is simply a description of how we used to live. We knew the name of the person behind the till. We smelled the fruit and chatted to strangers. We even ate food grown within walking distance, as my parents had an allotment next to the cemetery:So why have I been so critical of modern-day Teddington? Does it really deserve to be branded a 'Crap Town'? Well, yes and no.There's nothing uniquely terrible about Teddington. In many ways it is a pleasant suburb that offers a more relaxed pace of life than some of the more 'vibrant' London suburbs. I'd far rather raise my children there than Peckham or Perivale. But in its journey from being the poor relation of Richmond and Twickenham to becoming a property hotspot, Teddington has lost something. Perhaps the first sign of danger was when Brucie opened Tescos. One by one, the corner shops began to close. Some were converted into residential properties, while others became takeaways. The familiar, friendly faces behind the tills disappeared.Then, in the mid-1980s, the London property market began its gradual ascent into the stratosphere and Teddington, once seen as a bit drab and slightly too far away from London, became increasingly desirable, as Richmond, Sheen and Kew became unaffordable.People needed to be near London for work, but they didn't want to live somewhere where they had to worry about being mugged. They also wanted something that wasn't London, but wasn't the sticks either. Enter Teddington.What happened next is what's happened in most parts of London and many towns within commuting distance. Demand exceeded supply and house prices reached a point where people who had grown up in the area couldn't afford to get on the property ladder. They moved out and were gradually replaced by those who had the money.The sentence in the manifesto \"Show Your Kids Their Future\" is particularly poignant, because unless they have a considerable sum of money or can afford a mortage for properties that cost, on average, over 30 times the average salary, these children won't have a future in Teddington.Like me, they'll have to move somewhere else. That is the 'crapness' of modern Teddington. This blog post could have easily been about another London suburb - they're nearly all unaffordable now - but I know Teddington better than anywhere else.Teddington used to be a socially mixed town. It had its rough parts - in York Road the policemen always went in pairs - but most of the town was a blend of lower middle and working class and, most importantly of all, it felt like a real community.Perhaps Teddington still feels like that, with its smart resturants, pleasant cafes and artisan bakeries, but I suspect that the town's population is far more transient than it used to be, if the estate agent signs are anything to go by. Maybe I'm just a grumpy middle-aged man, resenting the inevitable process of change, but I'd like to feel that if my children grow up in an area, they can choose to stay if they wish and not be priced out of their home town.Of course, by that same logic I shouldn't have moved to Lewes, as I've probably helped to price Lewesians out of their local property market. It's all very complicated, isn't it.I think I'll go and have a lie down.One final thought. Although Teddington may not always have been at the forefront of the avant garde, my mother may have been an inspiration to at least one contemporary artist: Grayson Perry: That's a point in Teddington's favour, surely.P.S - On reflection, one positive thing I must mention is that my mother spent her last few years there surrounded by very caring neighbours. She probably wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for one particular neighbour. They were all families with young children who'd managed to move to Teddington just before the house prices went into meltdown. I saw an encouraging resurgence of the community spirit I remembered from the 1970s and 80s. But will any of those children be able to remain in Teddington when they grow up? That's the question."},

For some reason, I usually seem to end up in Bedfordshire or Hertfordshire. I've no idea why.When I learned, last week, that I would have to drive to Hertford, my heart sank. More ring roads and concrete. More people who look as if they are on their way to a day centre.But I was wrong. Hertford is rather nice:The centre of Hertford had a very strong 'market town' feeling - lots of quirky old buildings, with hidden alleys and courtyards. I also noticed that the people didn't swing their arms when they walked, which is always a good sign.Perhaps the woman in the distance is on her way to a day centre, but I'm sure they have a better class of jigsaw puzzle there.Castles are always a bonus and this river ends in a pleasant weir, right next to an arts centre with a chi chi cafe.I've forgotten who the statue is of. No-one I've ever heard of. I noticed that several signs pointed the way to a place called 'Bengeo'. Bengeo! What sort of a name is that for a town and why haven't I heard of it until today? Even buses were going there.It all sounds rather foreign - place names should end with a consonant. But apparently Bengeo is of ancient provenance, so I take it all back. Bengeo's main claim to fame is that it is the birthplace of Captain W. E. Johns - the author of the Biggles series of books, with titles that include Biggles Gets His Men, Biggles Takes It Rough, Biggles and the Poor Rich Boy and Biggles Fails To Return. There are 98 Biggles titles in all, but no Biggles of Bengeo, which is rather a shame. I liked what I saw of Hertford and tried to ignore the hideous car park and some of the less inspiring architecture on the outskirts. The centre would have been even nicer without the constant roar of traffic from the ring road, but the same could be said of most towns.I went to Hertford expecting bland uniformity and concrete ugliness. Instead, I found character and charm. I hope I have the chance to make a return visit."},
{"title": "Eastern Promise", "date": "Tuesday, January 21, 2014", "text": "It is autumn 1975 and I'm listening to the Top 20. Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody is No.1 and as the final piano chord fades away, a strange motif for brass can be heard repeating itself in the background: D-D-Eb-D-C-A-Bb-G. The following week, I notice it again. A few years later I discover that the tune is the call sign of Radio Tiranë, which shares the same frequency (247m medium wave) with BBC Radio 1.I begin listening to Radio Tiranë and become fascinated by the strange rhetorical language, with words like proletariat, co-optivist, imperialist, presidium and enigmatic phrases like people's intellectual. Albania, I learn, is a communist country.I start tuning in to radio stations in other communist countries, particularly Moscow and Prague. They are keen to tell me how wonderful their political systems are, but do it in such a mind-numbingly dull and humourless way, I find it hard to believe their claims. The announcers sound like robots and the stories are implausibly utopian, even to the ears of a schoolboy.It is the beginning of an slight obsession with communist Eastern Europe that has remained with me ever since. In 1988 I visit communist Czechslovakia and find that life there is even grimmer than expected. Shops are half empty, people are afraid to be seen talking to me and, more importantly, there only seems to be one flavour of ice cream. I plan to return to the Eastern Bloc as soon as possible, but a year later the Berlin Wall comes down. I'm very pleased, but also selfishly disappointed that an opportunity has been lost.However I was wrong about lost opportunities. I have probably learned and understood far more about the Warsaw Pact countries since the Berlin Wall fell, thanks to a succession of excellent memoirs, films and documentaries. Stasiland is probably the most successful book on the subject, in English at least, but I have just finished another memoir which I have enjoyed almost as much - the superb Red Love.There is something particularly interesting about East Germany. It isn't just the fact that country existed in opposition to another Germany, with a figurative divide that became a literal one, but also that many of its citizens were committed in a way that the Czech, Poles and Hunagrians never really were.After the Second World War, Germans were faced with two choices: amnesia or atonement. It could be argued that West Germany chose the former, while the East attempted to build a utopian society that would act as a historical counterweight to Naziism. The ruling elite of East Germany was dominated by long-standing communists, many of whom had either fled to Moscow in the 1930s or been imprisoned by the Nazis. They were committed. As for the ordinary people in the Oosten, they were used to goose-stepping soldiers and fatuous slogans. If the new rulers could put food on the table and provide jobs, that would be enough for most. Red Love could have simply been a well-written memoir of growing up in 1980s East Germany, but Maxim Leo wisely takes a back seat and concentrates on the remarkable stories of his grandfathers. One grandfather was a German Jewish communist who fought with the French resistance. The other was a committed Nazi who became an equally committed Stalinist. They both became nation builders in the new Germany.Leo's parents were also committted to the ideals behind the German Democratic Republic, but had a more ambivalent attitude because they were not saddled with the emotional and political baggage of the 1930s and 40s. A Stasi file described Leo's father as \"critical but sympathetic.\" Neither parent wanted to escape to the West.As for Leo, like many of his peers, he felt completely disillutioned with life in East Germany. He had no respect for the elderly elite whose social experiment had clearly failed. Older generations were prepared to endure a lower standard of living, either because they believed or were too afraid. The young had nothing to lose and once Glasnost appeared, the edifice crumbled.Reading Red Love today, I'm impressed by the bizarreness of a country where individuals are routinely designated enemies of the people, for the most spurious of reasons. How could a regime survive for so long? The Soviet tanks probably helped to focus people's minds, but there were also enough citizens who were prepared to spy on their neighbours. It was a country built on paranoia.Thank God those days have gone. But there are still echoes of the East, whether it's a journalist being arrested in Putin's Russia, or a corporate conference in which a managing director's banal slogans are being applauded by an audience of anxious sycophants. The fight continues.Finally, here are some photos from the Deutsche Demokratische Republik. Happy days:I hope you'll enjoy Red Love too. If you don't, your name will be added to a file. Expect a visit from one of my collegues. Possibly Gunther."},
{"title": "The Virtual Bookseller", "date": "Saturday, January 18, 2014", "text": "I'm feeling quite cheerful today, particularly as I've just been hearing about what an awful Christmas most of our friends have had. As Tolstoy observed in Anna Karenina, people are miserable for a variety of reasons, however there does seem to be a consistent thread running through most of the anecdotes I've heard: 40-something parents, squeezed between demanding young children and needy, elderly parents, several of whom have become too ill to return home and are still in Lewes.My mother-in-law attempted to spend Christmas with us, but had to abandon her journey because of the appalling weather. She got as far as Victoria Station, which was apparently full of exhausted, folorn-looking pensioners, dragging wheeled suitcases of presents. In their ap-free existence, they were blissfully unaware that the entire transport network had been shut down. Our Christmas was rather pleasant, apart from my growing conviction that I was going to die soon. I'm trying to convalesce, but it's difficult. When you work for a company or organisation, sick leave can feel like a minor victory against the machine. But now I'm the machine and I can't afford to take two weeks off, so I've been making short trips to work to fulfill orders and deal with enquiries. I'm relieved that I don't run a bookshop. I entertained the idea a few years ago, but was warned off by James Heneage, the former MD of Ottakar's. I'm very glad that I listened. I would have had to borrow money, either to buy an existing business or establish a new one and would have been servicing a debt in the face of declining book sales. Selling on the internet is easy, compared to running a shop. I don't have to start work at 9.00 and no longer have to worry about window displays, bestsellers, promotions, local parking charges, bad weather, staff sickness, health and safety audits, cashing-up, cleaning, deliveries, Christmas opening hours, signing sessions or dealing with customers. I have no 'brand'. I just sell my books for a pound or two less than the next person.If I work full time, I know that I will be able to cover the monthly bills and food shopping. If I put my feet up and start watching too many 1970s drama series in the afternoon, I'm confident that my bank account will go into the red halfway through the month, so that's my incentive to work.I've noticed that each country I sell to has its own quirks. German customers can be obsessed with delivery times, but are scrupulously honest. Italian buyers often seem pleasantly surprised when the book actually arrives, as if it is an unsual occurence. Americans rarely leave feedback unless they are annoyed, which distorts the seller rating. Some of them are also very sensitive to 'odors'. I realise that it is rather offputting if a book smells and if I detect a strong scent of tobacco or mildew, I'll either bin the book or mention it in the listing. Unfortunately, judging by the comments I receive, a small number of books slip through the net, probably because my nasal acumen has been dulled by the cowshed opposite my unit: Perhaps I should hold each book close to my nose and have a good sniff. But I don't fancy the idea of spending several hours a day inhaling spores and dust particles. I'm not sure what the answer is.Britain appears to be the home of pedants. My actual customers are fine, but I occasionally receive strongly-worded emails from browsers informing me that my book listing about so-and-so is woefully inaccurate and that the real first edition was published with a blue cloth cover in 1872. Sometimes, the timing (usually sent after 10.00pm) and tone suggests that the author has had a few drinks.Of course I don't like to make mistakes, but if the only existing record for a title is in error, I have no way of telling. I welcome politely-worded corrections, but take exception to the more pompous, boorish emails.I'm also slightly irritated by the emails I get from secondhand booksellers, particularly the ones in block capitals that read: \"PLEASE ADVISE BEST PRICE INCLUDING DEALER DISCOUNT AND 2ND CLASS POST.\" In a nutshell, they want to buy a book from me for around £4 and sell it on for a markup. I've no objection to that. If a seller has found customers who are prepared to pay more, then good luck to them. But when they want me to give them a 10% discount, cheaper postage and pay by cheque (which requires a time-wasting trip to the bank), I become rather grumpy and want to say \"Just buy the book, like everybody else\".Fortunately, most of the people I deal with, in every country, are thoroughly decent and reasonable (they are bibliophiles, after all) and the majority of emails are from customers telling me how delighted they are with their purchase. It's particularly gratifying when someone has been reunited with a much-loved book from their youth. Perhaps the aspect of my work that I find most satisfying is when a book that was destined for the scrapheap - literally - now has a new lease of life, bringing pleasure to another generation of readers. My business is small enough for me to care about each individual order and I enjoy finding out why Mrs X in Wyoming has spent so many years looking for the 1927 novel I've just sold to her.The other advantage of selling on the internet is that my working hours are completely flexible, which means that I can deal with my son's various problems without having to take time off. Sometimes a whole day can be lost to medical appointments or a sudden crisis, so it is useful to be in a postion where I can catch up at the weekend.I often go to work on Sunday, but I don't like it. The building creaks and groans, with noises that sometimes sound as if someone is standing behind me. It's very M. R. James at times.I mention M. R. James as if I'm familiar with his works, but apart from one short story and the odd BBC drama, I'm a stranger to his oeuvre; probably because I find it hard to become engaged with something I don't believe in. I prefer the more worldly company of Anthony Trollope.On the subject of Trollope, again, I'll end with this anecdote, which I forgot to mention in my last post:One day, Trollope was in his club and heard two men complaining bitterly about how annoying one of his characters was, in a story that was being serialised. Trollope tapped both men on the shoulder and said: \"Gentlemen, I shall have her killed within the week.\""},
{"title": "Was I Wrong About Trollope?", "date": "Tuesday, January 14, 2014", "text": "In a recent comment, I suggested that Anthony Trollope was the 'Werther's Originals' of English literature (for non-UK readers, they are a sweet/candy, favoured by the elderly). I also suggested that my current penchant for Trollope was evidence that I was knocking on a bit, or as the Spanish would say, es bastante viejo.When you need reading glasses and would rather take a Trollope than a trollop to bed, you have crossed a border. But I was wrong. Here is a young woman who loves Trollope, apart from The Warden, which she thinks is a bit boring:"},
{"title": "The Post-Operative Paradise", "date": "Saturday, January 11, 2014", "text": "Apart from inadvertently growing a beard, I have achieved very little this week. I'm not sure how long it takes to recover from surgery, but I'm in no hurry to return to work. I can't say I miss being surrounded by malevolent bulls and surly, limbless farm workers. Also, I think I'm temperamentally suited to indolence. But does reading count as indolence? I'm not sure. Particularly when the authors include Paul Theroux, Michael Blakemore and John Williams. As this is supposed to be a literary blog, I thought I'd recommend the best books I've read recently:Paul Theroux - The Last Train to Zona Verde\"A tourist doesn't know where they've been. A traveller doesn't know where they're going.\"Many things have been said about Paul Theroux: he is not a travel writer, but a writer who travels; he regards himself as a novelist, but the reading public don't buy his fiction; he hasn't written anything decent for 30 years; he is pompous, self-important, cynical and grumpy; even his brother doesn't like him...I could go on - everyone seems to have an opinion on the author. But who is Paul Theroux? Even he doesn't seem to be quite sure and wrote two novels - My Secret History and My Other Life - which narrate the alternate histories of a character called Paul Theroux.However, I liked the Paul Theroux that I met in The Last Train to Zona Verde. Written ten years after his African travel memoir, Dark Star Safari, Theroux is now in his 70s and realises that he is making his last journey on the continent. He has loved Africa since he taught there in the 1960s, but is depressed by the growing corruption and squalor that surrounds him. He asks himself the question that all travellers ask at some point: What am I doing here?\"Suffering has no value, but you have to suffer in order to know that. I never found it easy to travel, yet the difficulty in it made it satisfying because it seemed in a way to resemble the act of writing - a groping in the dark, wandering into the unknown, coming to understand the condition of strangeness.\"In a Daily Telegraph review, Kevin Telfer criticises Theroux for writing a book that \"feels more like a description of Theroux's inner state than what is around him.\" This not only seems to be rather missing the point of good travel writing, but is also woefully inaccurate, as one of the strengths of The Last Train to Zona Verde is its vivid accounts of the landscape and people. If Theroux is 'grumpy' about sub-Saharan Africa, it is because he is comparing the present day reality of the continent with the idealism of the 1960s:\"We have bestowed on Africa just enough of the disposable junk of the modern world to create in African cities a junkyard replica of the West, a mirror image of our own failures. Such places are transit camps filled with people who have been abandoned by their fattened and corrupt governments.\"But this is not a relentlessly gloomy book. Time and time again, we meet people who rise above the limitations of their backgrounds to triumph against the odds and Theroux is as keen to tell the stories of others as he is to ask himself what a 70-year-old man is doing on a journey that might end in death. I enjoyed this armchair journey to somewhere I never intend to visit and would recommend it without reservation. Michael Blakemore - Stage BloodThe mark of a really good book is one that makes you care about a subject you've never been interested in. In spite of having in-laws who worked in the theatre, I'm woefully ignorant about the subject and wouldn't have chosen to read this book if it hadn't been for this brilliant review by Simon Callow. Whether you're interested in the early years of the National Theatre or not, Stage Blood is a gripping read in which the octogenrian Michael Blakemore settles an ancient score with Sir Peter Hall. In the hands of a lesser writer, it could have been an unedifying read by an embittered old man, but this memoir sparkles with generosity and wit.Blakemore's portraits of figures like Olivier and Tynan are immensely entertaining, as is his description of Anthony Hopkins' disastrous, alcohol-fuelled performance of Macbeth. But it is the growing tension with Sir Peter, culminating in a terrible showdown, which rises Stage Blood above the level of an ordinary memoir and gives the reader a vicarious, visceral thrill.John Williams - StonerWhen you read a book that has been universally praised and selected as every other person's book of the year, it is hard not to feel a certain resistance. How could any novel possibly live up to this amount of hype? But Stoner did. Alexander Lernet-Holenia - I Was Jack MortimerOne of the best small publishers around is Pushkin Press, who specialise in discovering and translating lost classics, particularly European ones. I discovered them ten years ago, when I read Antal Szerb's wonderful Journey By Moonlight (originally published in Hungarian) and managed to get the book included in an 'Undiscovered Classics' promotion that I organised, across 130 branches of Ottakar's.  I Was Jack Mortimer is an short Austrian novel, published in 1930, that reads like that bastard offspring of Franz Kafka and Raymond Chandler. It also reminded me of Antal Szerb and Jiri Weil, with its highly developed sense of the absurd. The plot is simple enough: a taxi driver picks up a passenger at a station and is asked to drive to the Bristol Hotel. After a few minutes, the driver asks the passenger to clarify whether he wants the Old Bristol or the New Bristol. There is no reply. He repeats his question and is once again met with silence. When he is finally able to turn  round, the driver is horrified to see that his passenger has been killed. But how?What follows is an enjoyably absurd story that vividly evokes the spirit of Middle Europe between the wars. It only takes a couple of hours to read, so I'd recommend it for a journey.I've also enjoyed Trollope's Can You Forgive Her? - a great comfort read, full of wit and insight. I'd always regarded Trollope as a bit of an old windbag until I took the plunge a few years ago and read He Knew He Was Right. Perhaps I'm just getting old, but I find Trollope's novels increasingly appealing.Finally, I'd also recommend Max Hastings' book Bomber Command - another book about a subject I knew relatively little about. I had no idea that at the beginning of the War, British bombing was woefully inaccurate, with navigation equipment so rudimentary, that pilots were often miles from their targets. Occasionally, if a magnetic storm affected their compasses, they even flew in the wrong direction and one pilot - a man named Warren - unwittingly bombed an English city (from then on, his colleagues called him Baron von Warren). Although Max Hastings tries to be even-handed, it is clear that he doesn't have much time for 'Bomber' Harris, whose obsession with destroying every city in Germany allegedly clouded his military judgement and resulted in the unnecessary loss of life of both airmen and civillians. If I had to recommend just one book, then it would have to be Stoner, but you've probably already read it.At some point my wife will stop waiting on me hand and foot and I'll have to resume selling books, but in the meantime, I'm going to enjoy every moment.Finally, this has nothing to do with books, but I watched The Happiest Days of Your Life with my mother the other day and thought that this scene alone made the whole film worthwhile:"},
{"title": "New Year, New Look", "date": "Tuesday, January 07, 2014", "text": "It began around a month ago: a growing, but frustratingly nebulous feeling of 'wrongness', accompanied by an appetite for afternoon naps that increased in length. I remembered my wife's warning - \"Don't you dare be ill at Christmas!\" - and tried to carry on as normal, quietly ducking out of as many social engagements as possible. I read a lot, including the new Paul Theroux, a mammoth Trollope novel and the wonderful 'Stoner'.During a drive to see some friends in Hampton, just before Christmas, I wondered how I was going to get through the day and resolved to see a doctor as soon as possible. But what would I tell them? There is an undefined territory between wellness and illness that I've never been able to map. I procrastinated.Christmas and the New Year were the quietest we'd had for years, so I was able to conceal my growing inability to cope with everyday tasks. I largely kept my worries about the possible causes to myself and resolved to have a full medical as soon as possible.But three days ago, everything changed. A growing pain in the centre of my stomach quickly became excrutiating as it migrated to the right side. I consulted Google and felt fairly certain that I had appendicitis, but was a trip to hospital justified? I wasn't sure. I had a vision of a James Robertson Justice-style doctor pressing down on my stomach and annoucing to his young cohorts \"Ladies and gentleman, this man has been admitted with suspected appendicitis. I will now demonstrate that it is just wind.\"Then I read an entry about the complications that follow a burst appendix and my mind was made up.The Accident and Emergency department of Brighton Hospital was surprisingly empty for a Saturday night. The only people waiting to be seen were a young couple in their 20s, a rather malodorous homeless man and three Chinese people, who kept changing their seats every five minutes, possibly in an attempt to fox the queueing system. After what seemed ages, but was probably only 20 minutes, I was assessed and moved to a holding centre, where people lay on beds in cubicles. Opposite me lay a well-spoken woman, who faintly resembled the 122-year-old Jeanne Calment. She appeared to have forgotten what was wrong with her and the nurses' attempts to coax information out of her were largely unsuccessful.On my left, a curtain concealed a woman who sounded as if she was in her 50s. Unlike Madame Calment, she was able to remember every detail of the last 24 hours and proceed to give a blow-by-blow account of the minutiae of her day: \"Then I went to me mum and dad's and I sat down on the sofa, put on the telly and I 'ad a sausage roll...\" and on she went, until she eventually proved that ad nausea wasn't just a figure of speech.When the woman mentioned sausage rolls for the second time, I started to get the giggles. Each movement of laughter produced a spasm of intense pain, so I turned my attentions to the old woman.I thought how absurd it was that doctors and nurses were going through the charade of treating the old woman as if she had a curable illness, when the truth - the 'elephant in the room' - was she was just very old and had probably reached the natural end of her life. But what was the alternative?What upset me most of all was that the old woman appeared to be alone in the world. I thought of all the elderly people my mother knows who book unnecessary chiropody appointments, just so they can be touched by another person. After a pain relief drip failed to make any difference, morphine was introduced. That didn't work either, but after three further doses, I noticed that although I could still feel the pain, I felt curiously detached from it. I listened to the voices in the distance. Someone was being aggressive, but it was clear that they were very frightened. Another person kept talking in affected genteel accent about their 'anterior', trying to add a certain gravitas to their account, but undermining it with malapropisms.As I listened to what was going on around me, what impressed me most was the utter professionalism of the staff, who appeared to treat every patient with an unfailing courtesy and respect. I had plenty of opportunities to eavesdrop on conversations and was impressed by what I heard. Lame jokes were laughed at, dull anecdotes listened to with interest and confusion met with patience.I was less impressed by the patients, who were a rather rum bunch. A woman on my ward was booked in for an operation, but because she was obsese, diabetic and smoked 20 a day, the doctors wanted to run some tests on her heart first. Instead of being grateful for these precationary meaures, she whinged and moaned incessantly: \"I wanna go 'ome today. I don't wanna hang around in this shithole.\"I didn't like the woman's sense of entitlement, particularly given that her health problems appeared to be largely self-inflicted, but a universal healthcare system is there for the feckless, the irresponsible and the gluttonous as well as the abstainers, the joggers and the vegans.An elderly man with the strongest Sussex accent I've ever heard complained about the meals at every opportunity: \"Oi've got no complaint 'bout the 'awspital, but the food 'ere is doiabolical!\" A Filipino nurse replied \"If you don't like the food, I can get form for you to complain if you like.\" The Sussex man snorted: \"Forrrm? Caahn't see that it would make any difference, moi dearr. S'no point tryin'. Nawbody listens.\"Admittedly the food wasn't haute cuisine and it was appropriate that it was usually served by Eastern Europeans, as the last time I'd tasted anything like it was in communist Czechoslovakia, but it was still vaguely edible. As for the wards, they were anything but a 'shithole' - spotlessly clean and comfortable.Perhaps I have lower standards.My only complaints about the hospital were its design - which resembled one of those mazes that scientists use to induce stress in rats - and a litigation-avoiding obsession with doing everything in triplicate. When someone pressed down hard on my appendix, I consoled myself with the thought that now the diagnosis was complete, I'd never have to experience that pain again. How wrong I was.But I had music with me, which helped more than anything else. If you're ever waiting to go into surgery, I can strongly recommend Mozart's sublime 'Soave sia il vento'. After the operation, which wasn't the keyhole surgery I was hoping for, I spent the night in a dementia ward (the only place with an available bed) listening to one man yell \"Ben!\" every ten seconds for most of the night, while another shouted \"Push down hard on the fog 'orns boys\" (I don't think the sea view helped). In the morning, I saw the full horror of dementia - a condition that I had only understood in an abstract way before. The person calling out for Ben turned out to be an Irishman named Bill, who had reached a state where he couldn't remember what a cup of tea was for and regularly tipped the contents all over his bed as he examined the cup, trying to guess its purpose.Under the influence of morphine, the sound of Bill calling for Ben brought back the theme tune of a children's 'Watch with Mother' programme. But sadly the introduction of opiates into my system didn't result in any epic poems or symphonies. People compare the very old to young children, but infants learn and remember. Bill was unlearning, becoming less competent with each day. Here was a man who once made people laugh, had a job and made love, reduced to a state where he could no longer recognise everyday objects or remember where he was for longer than two minutes.Caring for Bill was draining. When he wasn't shouting for Ben, he yelled \"Nurse!\"every five or ten minutes and required a constant change of sheets. In the coming decades, the National Health Service will have to cater for a steadily increasing number of Bills. At what point will it become unsustainable?But my experience during the last 48 hours emphasised the strengths of the NHS more than its weaknesses. The medical care was second to none and the wards were clean and comfortable. It made the current controversy in the US about Obamacare seem even more absurd.This excellent cartoon has been doing the rounds recently (click on it to see the full cartoon). It lacks subtlety and the 'Anywhere but America' claim is inaccurate, but it still makes an important point:Of course the NHS is far from perfect. People wait too long for important tests, operation waiting lists are often unacceptably long and the labyrinthine bureacracy can sometimes be hard to deal with, but overall, the sum is greater than its parts. It is a noble idea that, most of the time, actually works.Long may it continue."},

{"title": "\"In Full Pursuit of the Uneatable\" - Boxing Day Morning in Lewes", "date": "Thursday, December 26, 2013", "text": "This morning I walked into town and saw a side of Lewes that was very different from its 'Islington-on-the-Downs' image:The 'meet' took place outside the White Hart Hotel, where Thomas Paine once used to attend meetings of the Headstrong Club. On the balcony, a man with a faulty megaphone made a barely audible speech that seemed to go \"Maaah the msssss, here a waaahh hmmm wehhhhwer...Royal family...Ennnaahhh tolllpum mahhh our country...mahhhh in forhhhh bin ohhhhh...Rule Britannia!\" The crowd applauded the final words, but there was a ripple of embarrassment. The horn sounded and a procession of hunters, horses and hounds rode off, ostensibly in pursuit, but perhaps, also in flight from the 21st century. Olde England. The rich man in his castle, the poor man at his gate.Once the last rider had passed, I walked past Lewes Castle and returned to my hovel. NB - The title of this post comes from Oscar Wilde's quote about foxhunting: \"The unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable\"; but I've been assurred that since the law was changed, the riders now merely follow a fox-scented trail."},
{"title": "Homing Instinct", "date": "Tuesday, December 24, 2013", "text": "I went back to Twickenham on Sunday and, for the first time since moving to Lewes, felt a slight pang of homesickness. I love living in Sussex, but it feels as if I'm on an extended holiday. Twickenham and Teddington, where I spent the first three quarters of my life, is still home.I began my visit by walking down Church Street. I wanted to see if the bookshop I used to manage was still there. It was, but only just.In the 1960s and 70s, it was a thriving business; the largest for miles around. As a child, I always bought my Enid Blyton books in Langton's, all of which featured children with names like Peter, Janet, Colin, Anne, Dick, Susan and Ernest. The books seemed wonderful at the time, but reading them to my son, a few years ago, I quickly lost the will to live.Later, as an awkward teenager, I purchased Pelicans with impressive-sounding titles like 'Progress, Peaceful Coexistence and Intellectual Freedom' (I don't think I ever read it, but the mere act of buying the book made me feel terribly grown-up).Sadly, in the 1980s, the owner decided to sell the business and the  shop entered a period of decline that seemed almost as long and drawn-out as the Byzantine Empire's. Langton's was bought by a couple who wanted to run it as a retirement hobby. They both looked bookish - tweed skirts and bow ties - but the husband was a complete philistine who huffed and puffed around the shop floor, expressing his disapproval of certain books. Holding a copy of the Complete Works of Oscar Wilde in his hand, he once said \"Do we have to stock books by homosexuals?\" But the Major's posturing was all hot air; his wife was very firmly in charge. She was a highly educated woman who quickly learned the rudiments of bookselling and maintained a decent stockholding. Unfortunately, she was also a very abrassive character, whose loud Lady Bracknell voice and hectoring manner alienated as many as it amused. The second nail in Langton's coffin was the appearance of a large branch of Waterstone's in Richmond, only a mile up the road. As well as losing sales, the owners also lost two members of staff, who couldn't wait to jump ship to a workplace where they wouldn't be treated like naughty children.In the face of growing competition and the collapse of the Net Book Agreement, the owners decided to retire for a second time. The business was put up for sale.A week or so after Langton's new owner had taken over, I decided to visit the shop. The moment I walked in, the atmosphere was completely different. Van Morrison was playing in the background and sitting behind the till, a balding, middle-aged man, with a long, grey ponytail, was chatting to a young woman.I bought a copy of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray'. Five minutes later, I was sitting in a pub across the road with the ponytailed owner, who offered me a job running the shop. \"The thing is,\" he exlained in a soft Ulster accent, \"I've got three other shops, so I need someone who can manage things here. How much are you being paid at Waterstone's?\" Like a fool, I told the truth. He offered an extra £500.It all looked promising enough. I would be managing three people and have complete control of the stock. I was also given the impression that there were more shops in the pipeline and that I had joined the next Waterstone's. I could hardly believe my luck.I spent several weeks decorating the tired-looking interior and improving the depleted range of titles. I felt that I was restoring the shop back to its former glory and was confident that the sales would begin to rise. Sadly, after only a month, it was clear that something was not quite right.My new boss was a charming, likeable man, but he was also maddeningly mercurial and disorganised. In hindsight, I now understand that the challenges of running four separate businesses and having a son with cerebral palsy must have been extremely difficult. But at the time, all I could see was a man who undermined everything I did.The owner specialised in secondhand books and his business mantra was \"If people can't find what they want, they'll buy something else instead\". I would often return to work after a day off and find that my carefully arranged bestseller bays were covered in a completely random selection of review copies, bought as a job lot from a journalist. At the time, the bestselling title was the Alan Bennett Diaries. Finding that our only copies had been concealed behind a single copy of 'A History of the Belfast Telegraph' for a whole weekend was frustrating, to say the least.But the thing that really got to me was the staffing. After beginning with three staff, my boss gradually whittled it down to one person: me. Each time someone left I was given the same story: \"Cashflow's a bit tight at the moment...if you can just hold off for another month...things will pick up soon...\" Managing a shop alone is challenging both practically and emotionally. The essential day-to-day tasks like banking, unpacking, shelving and cleaning have to be combined with manning a till point and dealing with enquiries. At Christmas, when deliveries are four times larger than usual, it is an almost impossible challenge to sell books and replenish the shelves. There is also the small matter of being able to buy lunch, eat it, or answer the call of nature. Eight hours is a long time to go without a break. However the greatest challenge was the sense of isolation. I had regulars who came in for a chat, but they were usually lonely individuals who would talk at, rather than with me; often at great length. After two years, I was well acquainted with the minutiae of their lives, but I doubt if they knew a single fact about me.As time passed, I realised that things wouldn't get any better. I now had occasional help from part-timers, but the money had stayed the same. I found a job with Ottakar's, where I went on to spend the ten most enjoyable years of my working life. My boss and I parted on good terms and to his credit, he gave me a very nice leaving present.Before my return visit to Twickenham, I'd heard that Langtons now had a cafe and was keen to see what it looked like, but as I walked towards the shop I saw that the windows had been whitewashed and a sign announced that the shop was for sale. I peered through a small gap in the window and saw the outline of a doorway that led to the children's section. I wasn't sure what was worse: a closed bookshop or a dying one? Perhaps the thing I'll miss most is the shop sign, with the font that has been the same for over half a century. After Langton's, I walked with my wife and sons down to York House Gardens:Unlike some parts of Twickenham, the riverside was reassuringly familiar, unchanged since I first went there in the 1960s:These statues, imaginatively known as the Naked Ladies, were acquired under mysterious circumstances by the notorious Victorian fraudster, Whitaker Wright - a man who evaded justice by taking a cyanide capsule after he was convicted. In some ways, the Naked Ladies have been a barometer of postwar Britain. When I was a small child, they were clean but the fountains hadn't worked for years, then as we entered the era of Punk and industrial strife, they were frequently vandalised, with the regular addition of blue pubic hair. At some point in the late 1980s, the vandalism ended. Ten years later, the fountains were restored. An arched 18th century footbridge connects the gardens to York House. I was very disappointed when I discovered that it houses offices for the local council, instead of a rakish lord. However, it had some auspicious former owners, including Sir Rajan Tata, Sir Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff and Philippe, comte de Paris.York House isn't famous, but anyone who has seen the film Alfie may experience a flicker of recognition:The main centre of Twickenham is grotty, but the walk along the towpath from Richmond Bridge to St Mary's church has barely changed since the 18th century and I'd forgotten how idyllic it was. When the good weather returns, so shall I."},

{"title": "Away in a Manger", "date": "Wednesday, December 18, 2013", "text": "Last night I dreamed that a girl I used to work with had been promoted to the position of area manager. I could see why. She was a fantastic bookseller who had an intuitive understanding of the trade, but I was concerned that she would be undone by certain flaws in her character.I knew that she would be too proud to take advice, but in spite of this, I laboured over a detailed document that spelled out the need to achieve a balance between the operational demands of the role and the importance of maintaining a good morale. I felt confident that she would listen to me.Then I woke up and remembered that she'd been sacked for 'financial irregularities' (and some sexual ones too).Why was I still dreaming about a job I walked out of six years ago? I briefly mentioned it to my wife, but we have an unspoken agreement not to bore each other about our respective dreams, particularly the recurring ones. I keep dreaming about bookselling. My wife dreams that she is back in her grandparents' house, where she lived from the age of nine. I have to remind myself that I still sell books, even if I now have to work on a farm, watching libidinous bulls sodomising each other - an unedifying spectacle that I wouldn't recommend. But even worse than the bulls is having to listen to the soft rock radio station, Heart FM, which I can hear through the partition wall of my cowshed. The gaps between the songs have a jingle that boasts \"More music variety!\", but it's not true. Every morning I hear the same singers: Robin Thicke, Olly Murs, Michael Buble, Adele, Robbie Williams and my least favourite song of all time, the screeching, nasal horror of Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\".There are moments, particularly when I can hear Adele being accompanied by the screams of a bull being sexually assaulted, when I wonder what I'm doing with my life. Where did I go wrong?But there is laughter in the dark, particularly when I find books like \"The Bedside Lilliput\". Published in 1950, it is a treasure trove of late-1940s culture, featuring Dylan Thomas,  V.S.Pritchett, Ronald Searle, Wyndham Lewis, Nancy Mitford, Bill Brandt, Walter de la Mare, Monica Dickens, Arthur C Clarke, Aleister Crowley, Sylvia Townsend Warner, Robert Doisneau and Arthur Marshall.I will be posting several extracts from The Bedside Lilliput, but I'll begin with a photographic essay from the French photographer, Robert Doisneau (the man who took this famous picture), with the original captions: H'm Ha!Oh! M'm  Sssh T'tAh!Ooh! The Bedside Lilliput appears to have been a one-off, although there were other literary magazines published in book form during the 1950s. I wonder what today's equivalents are."},

{"title": "Capital", "date": "Sunday, December 08, 2013", "text": "I was back in London yesterday, remembering why I left. For some reason, the tube seemed to be as crowded as a weekday rush hour, but the tourists and day-trippers lacked the steely determination of commuters and at one point I found myself in a gridlocked tunnel of suitcases and backpacks.Has the tube always been this crowded?Apparently, yes. I'd travelled to London to meet two old friends. I hadn't seen them for 13 years, but within minutes we'd settled back into the same relationship we had as teenagers, albeit with better social skills. It seemed silly that we'd let so many years elapse before meeting again, but sometimes life gets in the way.We grew up in leafy Richmond-upon-Thames (somewhere I never really appreciated until I visited the badlands of Neasden, Plumsted and Acton)  and when I was 16, I naively assumed that we would all remain in the area until our dying days, still meeting up for odd game of snooker, or perhaps to go cycling in Bushy Park. Taken during my 'stripes' phaseThe late teens are a magical time in some ways - a nebulous borderland between childhood and adulthood, when newfound freedoms aren't crushed by the burdens of responsibility.Naturally I squandered some of this time sitting in my bedroom feeling angst-ridden, but even that was enjoyable in an odd sort of way. I was the hero of my own narrative, able to delude myself with grandiose ideas that didn't have to be sustantiated by achievements. As one girl said to me, \"You're all talk and no action.\"I wouldn't go back to the past, but I wouldn't change it either.Thirty years on, none of us live in Greater London. I left 12 years ago. One held on until earlier this year, when it became possible for him to work from home. The other left in the 1980s. Another friend, who wasn't there yesterday, discovered the Kent coast before it started to appear on property programmes.The flight of hundreds of thousands of Londoners to the shires has, until recently, almost passed without comment, but next to immigration it is one of the biggest demographic changes this country has seen since the 19th century. In some ways, it is simply of reversal of what happened in the Victorian age, when London's population quadrupled in size and small villages and towns became swallowed up by the growing metropolis. Five generations ago, my ancestors left rural Kent in search of a better life. Today, their descendents are leaving London for the same reason. Perhaps, like me, they don't share Boris Johnson's vision of the future and would prefer to live in a less 'dynamic' economy that isn't obsessed with unsustainable growth. I suspect they would also like to live in a town where they know their neighbours and can feel reasonably certain that in 50 years' time, the streets and houses won't have changed beyond all recognition. But there is a price to be paid for this mass exodus. Some local people now sardonically refer to Lewes as \"Islington-on-the Downs\" and resent the fact that they are being priced out of the area by an influx of Londoners. Where can they go?The other night I went to a local screening of a worthy Chilean film about the 1988 referendum that rejected General Pinochet. The hall was packed, which was great, but it also made me realise how true the Islington jibe was. The town is becoming increasingly homogenous, like a retreat for Guardian readers.If friends hadn't moved away and property prices hadn't gone through the roof, would I have stayed in Richmond-upon-Thames? Perhaps. It wasn't a bad place to live:   On Richmond Green, outside 'The Cricketers' pubOn balance, I'm still glad that I moved to Lewes. Which is just as well, because unless you're in possession of a large fortune, once you leave London, there's no going back.Finally, a clip from the 'good old days'. I wonder if any of the children in this clip still live in London?"},
{"title": "Underworld", "date": "Sunday, December 01, 2013", "text": "106 years ago yesterday, a new London Underground station opened in the West End. It's purpose was to give the middle classes easy access to the heart of London's theatreland. It was initially called Strand, but was renamed Aldwych in 1915.Sadly, the station was a failure. Built at the end of a one stop spur on the Piccadilly line, the number of passengers was lower than expected and when several leading theatres in the area shut down, Aldwych became a white elephant. Surprisingly, it wasn't closed until 1994.Today, the London Transport Museum offers a limited number of guided tours of Aldwych station. The demand for tickets is high and the tours are usually sold out within hours. Luckily, I'd found out in time after making a brief foray into the Twitterverse and booked a ticket for yesterday afternoon.The train from Lewes was packed. At first it looked as if it was standing room only, but then I noticed that someone had done the old coat and bag trick on the seat next to them, so I took great delight in making them move their things. One point to me.As the train pulled out of Lewes and entered a tunnel, I got my book out. I wanted to find out what Alice Vavasor had written in a letter to her cousin Kate. Then it started: pchhh, pchhh, pfffff pfffff, pchhh pchhh, pfffff pfffff... My seat-hogging companion's earphones were just loud enough to distract me from reading, but not noisy enough to warrant a complaint. One point to them.I got my smartphone out and decided to watch a video. After scrolling through the list, I settled on an episode of 'The World at War', which I've been watching over the last couple of months. The credits began and the episode title appeared: Japan.I spent the next 50 minutes watching footage of Pearl Harbour, 'Zero' fighters, Japanese people performing Nazi-style acrobatics, Tokyo being bombed and the bloody capture of Iwo Jima. It was fascinating stuff, but for some reason my companion seemed to be increasingly agitated. I wondered why. It wasn't as if he could hear the explosions through my headphones.As the train drew into Victoria, my companion frantically gathered his stuff together, as if he couldn't wait to get off the train. I was busy watching footage of Kamikaze pilots, but turned off my phone and got ready to leave. I turned round and looked at my companion's face for the first time. He was Japanese.I wondered how interesting a station that had only been closed 20 years ago would be, but hadn't realised that the veneer of modernity had been stripped away and what remained was a series of fascinating time capsules: The lifts are now out of service, so visitors have to be prepared to use a 160-step staircase:This platform has been used in many well-known movies and television series and if you pay enough money, London Transport will even arrange for a train to appear.This is what's left of the 1907 tiles that bear the station's original name: Strand.During the Blitz, Aldwych station was a popular destination for Londoners who wanted to escape from the bombing. As the station was at the end of a branch line, families could camp on the platform for the night without disrupting any passengers.George Formby and other celebrities of the day used to perform concerts on this platform, some of which were relayed to the neutral USA as part of a propaganda effort.It's a pity that these original titles haven't been looked after properly in the past, but they must have seemed so commonplace, nobody could see their value.These early 1970s posters were very familiar to me, from the days when a trip \"up to London\" was the greatest of treats. My parents regarded the city as a den of vice, populated by hippies and other ne'er-do-wells. We only lived a dozen miles from Hyde Park Corner, but it might as well have been a hundred.The poster below was one of many that appeared before Britain joined the European Economic Community, as it used to be known.Above and below are photos of a platform that has been protected by a Grade I listing. Apparently it has some very unusual insulators, for people who like that sort of thing.The police regularly train sniffer dogs at Aldwych station. Our guide told us that for some unknown reason, the dogs refuse to enter this tunnel. The tunnel complex is a little spooky, but the best parts are those that haven't been lit:A couple of friends had joined me for the tour. They were both as impressed as I was, but one was disappointed by the absence of any maruading aliens. For British people of a certain age, the London Underground is synonymous with this:I must admit, I was also disappointed by the absence of rats, zombies, cybermen, yeti, third generation cannibals or SIS employees. However, the guided tour was excellent, striking the right balance between being informative and giving visitors time to look around and take photos. I'd happily go again. If I do, I'll bring a proper camera instead of relying on my phone.Apparently, Aldwych is one of 26 disused tube stations. I hope that London Transport are able to make a few others accessible for visitors, without actually turning them into proper tourist attractions.Indeed, one of the best aspects of the tour was the absence of tourists. I'd just spent half an hour trying to dodge my way past hordes of people aimlessly dragging suitcases on wheels. The Aldwych tour filtered out the box-ticking \"10 Things You Must Do\" brigade. As you can see, quota of white, balding middle-aged men was predictably high, but there were also a couple of beanie hat-wearing 'urban explorers' and someone who was particularly interested in some of the Art Noveau features. After the tour, we went for a drink in the Strand, followed by superb curry in the India Club. I left London agreeing with Dr. Johnson, but also felt grateful that ten minutes away from my front door, I have this:"},
{"title": "A Commercial Break", "date": "Tuesday, November 26, 2013", "text": "It has been a rather odd few weeks. My best supplier of books went bust, a friend learned that they were in the final stage of lung cancer and my oldest son almost managed to burn the house down.My wife says she feels as if we're in a badly-written soap opera. I know what she means, although I'm sticking to the 18th century novel theme that I mentioned in an earlier posting. Our lives are more Smollett than Eastenders, not relentlessly grim, but oscillating unpredictably between triumph and disaster.For example, only days after my book supplier went out of business, a far bigger one got in touch and said that they would be able to supply me with whatever I needed. Then a week later, a corporate customer contacted me about supplying books. My only role in both events was to say yes.Sadly, I don't see how there will be a change in fortunes for the friend with cancer.20 years ago, she was living in Los Angeles. Her father was a Hollywood screenwriter, her sister was married to a movie star and our friend worked for a film studio. She seemed to have a gilded life. But then the biological clock began to ring and she convinced herself that a man she met at a party was 'the one'.She became pregnant and looked forward to a new life with her husband and child, but two things happened. First, she quickly realised that the father was not husband material (or even father material). Second, the baby turned out to be babies. For some reason, she decided to raise the children in her native England and found a house in Lewes. As a single mother of twins in a new town, life must have been hard enough, but it would become even more challenging when it emerged that one of her boys was severely autistic.I've no doubt that smoking played its role in the lung cancer, but I also think that she was run into the ground by a life that was unremittingly hard. Her autistic son never sleeps for more than a couple of hours at a time, so neither does she. Sometimes he hits her. She looks frail and worn out.When I drove her home from the hospital, I tried to think of something to say. I thought of all the people I knew who had survived cancer. But I also knew that whatever I said, it would sound like a hollow platitude. In the end, all my wife and I could offer was practical help: homemade soups, lifts and visits.This year has made me feel jittery. I think most of us like to believe that we have a certain degree of control over our lives, but during the last 11 months, most of the evidence has been to the contrary. I notice that I have become obsessed with certain household chores, as if the chaos of the external world can be counterbalanced by the order of the internal.Perhaps that's why some people in Russia and East Germany have expressed their nostalgia for the days of communism, when people could feel reasonably confident that nothing would ever change.Take this old Soviet commercial, for example:There's no existential nonsense about lifestyle or aspirations of auditory perfection. It's a radio. It's got a volume/on-off button and a tuning dial. You can be certain that it will be slightly crap and that you'll have to wait for two years before yours is delievered from the Novgorod People's Transistor Radio Combine. I wonder if the Soviets included batteries?In the next commercial, the announcer is saying \"Can you guess which one of these men is a Zionist enemy of the people?\"It's a little menacing. The next commercial is jollier, but notice that the man has to try twice to shut the door of the car, and the numberplate is wonky:In the next commercial the message is clear: if you want to eat a decent meal, you need to be a magician:The final clip has some groovy music and features a couple on their journey to nuptial bliss:It's a pity they'll have to share their flat with another family. The whole business of flat-sharing was, perhaps, the single biggest failure of the Soviet Union. In a country with such a low population density, why was it impossible for the communist authorities to provide every family with a home of their own?But perhaps that will be London in a few years, unless someone stops people treating the city's property as an investment opportunity. Apparently, 75% of all house sales in inner London go to foreigners (and by foreigners, I mean people who live outside the UK, rather than the ones that have moved here) who want a good property portfolio. It's utter madness.It's interesting how the two extremes of a completely planned economy and a totally free market end up producing the same results. That's why I'm always suspicious of people on both the right and left who pursue ideologies at the expense of common sense.I apologise for being so serious in this post. Let's have another commercial break:"},

I had to wait until yesterday to find a buyer. I'm very glad that this book has found a new home, as I rescued it from a skip a couple of years ago. I can happily bin a 13th impression of Rogue Herries, but this rare title was too good to throw away. These scans - mostly of exhibition stands - don't do justice to the originals, but I think that they convey something of the cautious optimism of a battleworn Britain:BOAC and BEA eventually became BA, or British Airways. I've no idea why.This is a stunning exhibition stand that has aged far better than the products it is promoting. By the time I was born, televisions were far more modern-looking, but still seemed to break down on a regular basis. My parents knew all of the DER repairmen by name.The brand name 'English Electric' sounds rather incongruous, but between 1918 and 1968, they were one of the most successful British companies of their kind.In a recent poll on a Facebook group I belong to, the launch of ITV was the most popular answer to the question: \"Which single event heralded the beginning of the decline of Britain?\" The shock of having commercial breaks was more than some could bear and I knew children who weren't allowed to watch ITV. They missed some good programmes.I usually associate electric bar fires with the bedsits of 'angry young men' in films like Room at the Top. The image of a frustrated, duffle-coated Colin Wilson fan feeding his last half crown into the meter doesn't quite fit with the glamour of this display. This showroom promises a brighter future, but the reality was postwar rationing and austerity in a country that had been almost bankrupted by the Second World War:The book is now in the post.

Revolving chandeliers? Flashing disco light switches? It's never made clear. The three men in the second advert look as if they've been given the afternoon off from KGB headquarters and exude an atmosphere of silent menace. The final commercial is for a 'mini-stereo'. It has two headphone sockets, as the authorities probably allocated one for every two people. I hope they had the same taste in music.Everything in the three overlong commercials, from the tinny electronic music to the fashions and hairstyles, is a watered-down version of what was happening in the West. 25 years on, everything has changed. I wonder what the gentlemen of the Politburo would have made of this 2012 advert:Valentina Tereshkova would probably also be turning in her grave, if she wasn't still very much alive.

{"title": "Beaton and the Baroness", "date": "Monday, October 28, 2013", "text": "Yesterday, during a stormy afternoon, I came across an illustrated 1939 autobiography called 'My Royal Past', by Baroness Von Bülop:It didn't look terribly inspiring, but then I noticed that the Baroness had collaborated with Cecil Beaton and my curiosity was aroused. Somehow I couldn't imagine him willingly writing a hagiography of a minor European royal, so what had prompted him to act as her amanuensis?More to the point, who on earth was Baroness Von Bülop?Born in an obscure German principality, Baroness Von Bülop seems to have been well-connected and appears in many group portraits of the leading aristocrats of  fin de siècle Europe. If there was a coronation, royal wedding or christening, she was there:But although Von Bülop was a great socialite, she was perhaps happiest when alone with her easel:\"Sir Edward Landseer was keenly interested in one of my early aquarelles and deemed it full of promise.\" In 'My Royal Past', the Baroness comes across as a woman of strong passions, capable of acts of great generosity, but also quick to anger:\"Yesterday I had a particularly friendly word for the stable-boy. Later, he was emboldened enough to chase one of the housemaids. I had him dismissed on the spot.\"On a less enlightened note, it has to be said that Von Bülop was no looker:At this point, I began to smell a rat and as I flicked through the pages of photographs of duchesses and dowager princesses, my doubts grew:The next photograph, featuring a character called 'Duckie', confirmed my suspicions:Needless to say, the women are actually men - Beaton's friends in drag.'My Royal Past' is a shameless parody of the self-serving autobiographies of aristocrats and minor royals that littered the bookshelves of 1930s Britain. Once I began to read the text, I saw the joke:\"I reflected, not without venom, that my aunt did not seem to trouble about me or my welfare when I was less useful to her. Our confidential intercourse was practically over, and I noticed to my annoyance that she had struck up a close friendship with the Baroness Cissi Baptist-Aggisberg, a lady whom I am told came from the Island of Lesbos.\"As for Baroness Von Bülop, she was actually a Chilean playboy and opium addict called Antonio de Gandarillas, known to his friends as 'Tony':Beaton's book appears to have been largely forgotten, which is a pity because it is a very amusing satire. I have enjoyed reading about Von Bülop's childhood in Pottersfelden Castle and her English governess, Alice Blood-ffoulkes, who taught the young Baroness the poems of Sir John Suckling.I found myself nodding in agreement when the Baroness decried the 'dread age of jazz, which I so abominate':\"In (my day) it was considered a disgrace if the son of a prominent family took to lucrative employment. Nowadays, everybody works, even the least deep thinkers. People hobnob with parvenues and live in restaurants and hotels. So much has been lost with the passing of the carriage.\"Sitting in her 'den' at Klosterhoven, the Baroness laments the passing of time:Revolution has claimed both her loved ones and wealth, but at least the Baroness still has her fine collection of photographs and sketches:Sadly, in a chapter entitled 'I Eat Humble Pie', the Baroness falls on hard times and endures the stigma of penury. However, a chance encounter in a 'night-club' with a young Englishman called Cecil Beaton changes her fortunes. He agrees to help Von Bülop write her memoirs and also finds a room in a convent, after hearing of her exploits in a sailors' hostel:\"The Mother Superior here is very kind and the restictions are not great. I am allowed out during the day and as long as I return by six o'clock no one asks questions. There are few things that cannot be fitted in before sundown. Paris is still its same naughty old self, and so am I.\"I wonder if the young Barry Humphries ever read this book. There are more than a few shades of Dame Edna in Beaton's creation. The appeal of Beaton's books is that he manages to combine his gifts as a photographer, writer and artist to produce something that is remarkably quirky and subversive for its time. Some of his cut and paste photographs, with people added to group portraits or superimposed on unlikely backgrounds, rival today's Photoshop efforts.Cecil Beaton seems so inextricably linked with the age of the 'bright young things', it is easy to forget that he had a successful postwar career and was a mentor to photographers like David Bailey. He also lived long enough to witness the Sex Pistols use his portrait of the Queen for the cover of their 'Never Mind the Bollocks' album, employing the same cut and paste technique as the young Beaton. I wonder what he thought.One other piece of Beaton trivia is that he was bullied at school by Evelyn Waugh:\"The tears on his long lashes used to provoke the sadism of youth and my cronies and I tormented him…Our persecution went no further than sticking pins into him and we were soundly beaten for doing so.\"Over 40 years later, in what must have been an odd encounter, Beaton took Waugh's portrait:I can't say I'm surprised to read that Waugh Minor bullied the young Cecil Beaton. He was like that. But I'd like to think that if he ever encountered Baroness Von Bülop, he would have met his match."},
{"title": "The End Times", "date": "Wednesday, October 23, 2013", "text": "On Monday, my best supplier phoned to tell me that they were closing down and that this was my last chance to get some books. I was shocked. It had seemed such a well-run business, with hard-working, motivated staff. What had gone wrong?I didn't have time to book a van, so I decided to spend a day there sorting through the stock and bring the best books back in the car. When I arrived, the following day, the staff seemed philosophical about the closure. Someone told me that the sales had been declining steadily for quite a while and the business had reached a point where it was no longer making any money. They'd been given the bad news last Friday, with one week's notice.My prediction about the penny book market was right, including its effect on my business. I wonder when my turn will come?But if the Lewes branch of W.H.Smith's is to be believed, some people are still buying books:I wonder how many people actually read the celebrity biographies they've been given for Christmas. The paperback sales for older titles would suggest that the vast majority of these books are unread.For example, in November and December 2000, my bookshop sold around 400 copies of this: It was one of the bestselling books of the season. The following year it came out in paperback and everyone expected it to be a popular holiday reading title. We sold six copies.During my last day at the supplier, I saw thousand of celebrity biographies in a huge waste container. At some point they will be pulped and turned into something useful. I must have sorted through 2,000 books yesterday and arrived home with just 350. I was covered in dust and the remnants of rusty water from when I tripped and fell in a waterlogged skip. I went to the loo to wash my hands and caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. I looked feral, in a vaguely post-apocalyptic way.At home I had a bath and changed into my Lewes gentleman's clothes to attend the screening of a documentary on fracking. I'm ashamed to say that I knew very little about the subject until last night and only went to support a friend who had organised the evening. I'm very glad I went. Here's the trailer:Our friend was nervous about the event. She'd arranged for the director, Josh Fox, to present the film and answer questions afterwards. A few days earlier he'd been doing the same thing in Los Angeles. How would he feel talking to a dozen people in Lewes?We arrived expecting a half-empty hall. Instead, we found this:It looks a little like a neo-Nazi rally or an over-enthusiastic question and answer session, but they were just holding their hands up for a photo-shoot, which Josh Fox later tweeted. There were around 400 people, some of whom were veterans from the recent protest at Balcombe. The documentary was an eye-opener. Until last night, all I knew about fracking was that it involved pumping water into the ground and fracturing rocks - a process that might cause minor earthquakes. I had no idea that the water that was being pumped included carcinogenic chemicals and elements that include benzene, formaldehyde, hydrochloric acid, mercury, lead and uranium. Even allowing for the director's bias, the scientific evidence seemed overwhelming. If we permit fracking in the United Kingdom, there is a very real danger that our water supplies will become contaminated as they have been in parts of the USA.Before the film began, several people spoke passionately about fracking. I was most impressed by a very ordinary-looking man who said that he'd come all the way from Blackpool to warn us not to believe the hydraulic fracturing companies: \"They said they'd be able to pump the contaminated water back up and take it to the one treatment plant in the UK that deals with water like this. But the plant couldn't cope with such a quanity at that level of pollution. They were overwhelmed. In the end, they had to quietly dump some of it in the Manchster Ship Canal.\"I thought of a BBC News clip that show children swimming in the canal, earlier in the year.I'm not a scientist, but even my rudimentary grasp of the subject tells me that if you pump polluted water down into the earth and fracture rocks, those fractures will create fissures. Gravity will pull the water down into these cracks,at which point we no longer have any control over where it goes.Of course, we can't prove that any future fracking activity in Balcombe will have an impact on the local water table. But as one person in the audience pointed out, the burden of proof lies with the energy companies to prove that fracking is safe, not for the protesters to prove that it's dangerous.I will keep reading around the subject - I want to hear as many opposing arguments as possible. In the interests of balance, here's a film from Chevron.Has that reassured you? I will not be buying a 'Frack Off!' t-shirt - I think that pun alienates as many people as it amuses. But unless the energy companies and pro-fracking lobby manage to put forward a convincing case, I will be joining the protest. It has been a day a grim forebodings. A bookless future, drinking poisoned water out of methane-leaking taps. It sounds like a Kevin Kostner film. I think it's time to watch another DVD boxed set."},

The children who play in these fields will be able to have a proper playground, with clean concrete, instead of mud and grass.This man is called a town planner. He must design homes that are cheap to build and do not take up too much space. The man has designed many new buildings for this town. He lives in an very old house in another town.The fields are dug up and an old church from long ago is demolished. The ground is then flattened so that there will be space for a car park and a row of coffee shops. To make sure that the ground is hard and the grass cannot grow back, the builders use concrete. When the concrete is dry, they can begin to make the new homes.This man is not very good at making walls because he has never done it before. A house with walls like this might fall down.The man told his foreman that he had built walls in the Slovak Republic, but he was not telling the truth. Brian is about to hit his hand with a hammer.

These flats will be clean and modern. The people who live here will have a lovely view of the town.Would you like to live in the sky?There are also new houses. They will be much nicer than the cold, damp homes that were built in olden times. Instead of dull, plain bricks, the walls will be covered in pretty, tiny stones, called pebbledash. As the town grows, it will need extra electricity. This new power station will give people the energy they need and also make new jobs.The town is big, but it can get even bigger, as there is a lot of countryside.

{"title": "Back to Waterstones", "date": "Saturday, October 12, 2013", "text": "Yesterday I returned to Waterstones in Piccadilly for the first time in years. The last time I was there, it was to attend a tedious and morally repugnant training course on a thing called IPI, which stood for Individual Performance Improvement. It was a euphemism for 'managing people out of the business' or, more bluntly, getting rid of people without having to pay them any redundancy money.The word 'sacking' was a complete taboo, naturally.I found the terminology of Waterstones rather depressing: resource for staff, learnings for lessons, handselling for talking to customers and, worst of all, product for books. In the end, I managed myself out of Waterstones before anyone had the chance to subject me to the full horrors of IPI.Today, Waterstones is a different place. The company is now back in the hands of real booksellers and the shops look better than ever, with a vastly-improved range and presentation that recalls the good old days of Waterstone's, minus the mess. I'd travelled to Piccadilly to meet a friend and as it was a little early for the pub, we decided to have tea in the restaurant on the 5th floor.The view from the restaurant was impressive and the atmosphere was very relaxed compared to the  tourist-clogged streets of the West End, but I was slightly put off by an irritating tannoy that kept shouting in a shrill, insect-like voice. What was the point of it?Then I noticed that it wasn't a tannoy. Sitting at a table by the window, a large woman in her late 50s, with long hair and a tweed poncho, was watching a video on her laptop. She must have turned up the sound to compensate for the noise of people's conversation and the clanging of plates in the kitchen. People started to look at the woman and at one point I thought a waitress was going to speak to her. But in true London fashion, everyone pretended it wasn't happening. When I decided to take the law into my own hands, she seemed genuinely surprised. Has it now become socially acceptable to play videos in public places? As we left the restuarant and reached the top of the staircase, I remembered that this used to be one of the suicide hotspots of London. The winning combination of alarmingly low bannisters and an unhindered 100-foot descent to a solid marble floor exerted a fatal attraction for some and we became used to the emails that read \"Waterstones Piccadilly will be closed for the rest of the day.\"I was relieved to see that the new management had added perspex screens above the bannisters.Like me, my friend used to manage bookshops for Ottakar's. She left 12 years ago and now had a successful career in academic publishing, but missed the fun and camaraderie of bookselling. I agreed, but said that we were lucky to have left when we did.James Daunt's Waterstones seems a much better place than the bad old days of HMV, but the shops feel like the last days of the Byzantine Empire.Managing Director James Daunt has tried to keep one step ahead of the decline in high street sales by focusing on making Waterstones more profitable. Loss-making stores have been closed, superfluous senior managers have been culled and the expensive head office in Brentford was closed (the slimmed-down management team now work in Waterstones Piccadilly).But perhaps Daunt's most radical move took place earlier this year, when every manager and assistant manager was asked to reapply for their job. The aim was to reduce the payroll costs (I would guess by something in the region of £4,000,000) and ensure that the remaining managers were proper booksellers.Sadly, the plan backfired somewhat, as some of the best managers in the company decided to jump ship rather than go through the consulation process. Out of 487 managers, around 200 left.I met some ex-Waterstones managers at a party last week and the general view was that they felt that it made more sense to take the money and run (there was a relatively attractive redundancy package). I asked why, as I'm sure they would have kept their jobs. Their answer was simple: they felt that there was no future in bookselling.Several years of declining sales, watching customers use their shops as a showroom for smartphone purchases from Amazon, had convinced these managers that the writing was on the wall. It was time to leave the sinking ship.But was Waterstones a sinking ship?In a recent interview, James Daunt asserted that Waterstones would be back in profit within two years. It seemed a grandiose claim, but W H Smith has surprised everyone by producing ever-improving profits in the face of declining sales, thanks to some very astute financial controls.If Daunt can follow suit, reducing the costs of the business at a level that outpaces the decline in sales, then the chain could survive for years. But if I was a manager in my 30s, I wouldn't take that gamble.By the time my friend and I left it was dark. We walked in the rain, avoiding the groups of shuffling tourists, until we found a reasonably enticing pub. As we sat drinking our pints of Guinness, we reminisced about the days when we'd go to launch parties, stagger home, sleep for four hours and then go to work.We were usually indefatigable, although there was one occasion when my staff found me asleep on the office floor after a particularly generous publisher invited us to a cocktail bar. At the time it was great fun (although my liver probably wouldn't agree) and it never occured to any of us that this world would come to an end. Every year, Ottakar's opened new branches and I assumed that this process of expansion would continue for many years to come.When I opened my most recent shop, I had no idea that it would be one of the last new bookshops in the UK.Of course, there are still bookshops, launch parties and author signings, but it is taking place against a backdrop of a relentless decline in year on year sales. Every year, Byzantium gets at little smaller and the Ottoman Empire gets a little larger. Soon, the enemy will be at the gates.I wonder where it will all end."},
{"title": "The Certainty of Chance", "date": "Thursday, October 10, 2013", "text": "Suddenly, people are buying books again. I've no idea what invisible forces made my sales dramatically slump three weeks ago, only to make a spectacular recovery last week. There doesn't seem to be any pattern to it, apart from the slight boost that always occurs around paydays.Sometimes I feel like a cork, bobbing around in a vast occean, pushed and pulled by competing currents and air masses.The constantly changing fortunes of self-employment remind me of the introductions to each chapter in a Tobias Smollett novel:* I journey to London, where I shall establish myself as a merchant of some import* On a lonely road I am assailed by vagabonds* I am left ragged and destitute* I meet a gentleman of some distinction, who is searching for his long-lost son* During a tempest we retreat to an inn and I relate the tale of my antecdents* The gentleman becomes animated* I learn that this benevolent stranger is none other than my father* I am the heir to a vast fortuneOr something along those lines. These days, we could accuse Smollett of 'spoilers', but somehow they add to the absurd charm of his picaresque tales.But it isn't just self-employment that has proved to be unpredictable. A few months ago, my older son suddenly announced that he wanted to go back to school. A year and a half of home education had left him feeling isolated and his social contact was largely limited to online, multi-player games.These games were not a success. My son regularly chastised American teenagers for making homophobic remarks, which didn't win him many friends, while they wondered who the weird kid with the squeaky voice was. Why wasn't he at school? The prospect of getting my son back into full-time education seemed too good to be true. But there was a catch. He was determined to go to a Steiner school that he'd heard about from one of his online 'friends'. If he went, I would have to find £2,100 per term and spend the next three years driving him to the school, which was eight miles away.Naturally, I put any objections  to one side (including some reservations about how I could earn the extra £6,300 if I was spending two hours a day driving to and from the school). A few people warned me about some of the more eccentric aspects of Steiner education, but could I really deny my son this opportunity just because Rudolph Steiner believed in gnomes? I  was completely focused on getting my son out of the house again, socialising with his peers, gnomes or not.But as the term drew nearer, I began to worry about the practicalities. How could I make a three-year-long financial committment when book sales were so unpredictable? Also, was I falling into the trap of thinking that I had found a solution to my son's problems?In the face of growing pressure, I did what any sensible person would do and started watching boxed DVD sets of 1970s drama serials. I began with this:Described by the New York Times as \"the best spy series in television history\", 'The Sandbaggers' was made by Yorkshire Television between 1978 to 1980 and looks incredibly low-budget from a modern perspective. In an inversion of the 'Show, don't tell' rule of good fiction, most of the tension in the episodes is derived from people picking up phones in offices and describing events that are never seen: \"Cartwight's just called in. The No.2 at the Budapest station has just been seen handing flowers to a woman who's linked to Vedernikov.\"When the cast do venture out of the office to either rescue a stranded agent or bump off an errant SIS employee, the location filming shows how remarkably versatile Yorkshire is at replicating grim, Warsaw Pact suburbs, Cypriot forests or Arctic wastelands. It would be impossible to get away with a drama series that was almost entirely studio-bound unless the writing was top-notch. Fortunately, the series' creator, Ian Mackintosh, was more than equal to the task and with a first-rate cast headed by Roy Marsden, the result is a triumph.It has been suggested that Ian Mackintosh's remarkable evocation of life inside the Secret Intellignece Service could only have been written by someone who was intimately acquainted with MI6. Indeed, one episode was hastily withdrawn after it was deemed to be too close to the truth. Mackintosh refused to be drawn either way when questioned about his sources.There were three series of 'The Sandbaggers'. A planned fourth series never saw the light of day, as Ian Mackintosh mysteriously disappeared in a light aircraft while flying over Alaska. The plane's last position was some distance from the planned route and no wreckage was ever found.Here's a brief clip from the end of the first episode: I really enjoy ploughing through a boxed set, but would I be able to afford such luxuries once my son was at his new school? Then suddenly, without any warning, my son announced that he'd changed his mind and now wanted to go to a normal state school. I questioned his decision and was given a remarkably coherent and well-argued list of reasons. The following day I asked my son again and he seemed even more certain.I'm not quite putting out the flags, but I do feel a huge relief that I don't have to try and sell an extra £6,000 worth of books in what's proving to be a rather precarious market. In the meantime, I have several boxes of books to work through, so I'll stop this rambling post and start earning some money."},

Having finished the piece he dropped sixpence on the organ lid and was about to depart when the organist stopped him. \"How do I know you are right?\" he demanded. \"I've been playing like that for three solid months. \"The man black drew himself up proudly. \"Nobody can tell me how that should be played,\" he declared. \"I am Mascagni.\"The following day the piece was played to a slower tempo and, chalked on the side of the barrel organ, was the simple legend, \"Pupil of Mascagni.\"'"},
{"title": "Now and Then", "date": "Tuesday, October 01, 2013", "text": "This afternoon, while filling in a form, my wife asked me what my occupation was. I thought of all of the different options before reluctantly answering \"Bookseller. But I'm not really a bookseller, am I?\" Even after 25 years, I still resist being defined by my occupation. It would be different if I was a composer, writer or artist - I could say any of those with pride. But bookselling is something you do when you don't know what you want to do.In the past, the job had its compensations. I got to read new novels months before they were published. I met novelists, actors, artists, gangsters and models, enjoying the demimonde of London without having to buy a single drink. I also worked with some lovely people.However, today my working life is mainly one of drudgery. I buy books in bulk, knowing that most of them are worthless, hoping that the few that are of value will keep the wolves from the door for another month or two. So far I've kept going, but the sales have been rather patchy recently.My book sales used to be fairly predictable. I knew that I would sell x number of books per thousand on sale, and that 60% of the orders would be from within the UK.However, that's all changed. For some reason, the ratio of domestic to foreign orders has reversed and on some days, I sell more books to Amazon Germany than its UK branch. I thought I was doing something wrong, but when I spoke to a friend who sells ties on eBay, she said that she'd had an awful summer. It looks as if people in Britain have stopped buying things they don't need. I'm in trouble.As a result, I've neglected blogging and days out, so that I can knuckle down and increase my sales inventory to compensate for the downturn in sales. I've been taking so many boxes of books to and from home, that several neighbours have assumed that we're moving. It's been hard work, but I have come across some interesting books.This dustjacket is somewhere between the salacious covers of 1950s Pan paperbacks and the Fleming/Deighton adaptations of the early 60s. The Lady Chatterly trial is over and suddenly, everyone appears to be sex mad.      \"I just need to measure the light by pressing this against your chest\"This is from a 1960s book on taking portraits. The 'glamour' element is creeping in, but there are also some interesting pictures that don't feature tasteful nudity:This is a great photograph, with echoes of Yousuf Karsh. Sadly the book is worthless, so I ripped out the plates before I threw it away.I've no idea what this man is doing. He seems very respectable, but perhaps he is distilling the LSD that will destroy the social fabric of Great Britain, paving the way for sitar music and kaftans. I've no idea.This is Jack de Manio - a name that will probably mean nothing to most people, unless you're British and were born before the 1960s. The name sounds vaguely like a New York boxer or gangster, but he was every inch the English gentleman:De Manio was one of the original presenters of Radio Four's Today and when his laid-back, clubable persona didn't fit with the more earnest, news-oriented direction the programme took in 1970, he resigned. He was almost sacked in 1956 for carelessly announcing a programme called Land of the Niger as Land of the Nigger. De Manio's autobiography, Life Begins Too Early, is a very entertaining account of his bizarre childhood, when he had to compete with a monkey for his mother's affections. There are also some amusing accounts of his wartime experiences, during which he was both awarded the Military Cross and dismissed after a Court Martial. It's only a penny on Amazon, so you have nothing to lose.I barely remember the 1960s, but these creatures made a very strong impression on me: I still remember the terror I felt when I saw a Dalek in Arding and Hobbs - a department store at Clapham Junction. It moved, waving its sink plunger menacingly. I had no idea that a small child had climbed inside and put a shilling in the slot for a one-minute ride.Finally, if you were born in Britain during the 1960s, you may remember this:This is from a BBC schools educational series called Look and Read. The programmes lasted for about 15 minutes and were divided up into three segments. The first and last segments contained a filmed drama series, but the middle contained a tedious section that introduced children to words like tug, wharf and mob.The fourth chapter, called 'The Big Job', asks children to \"Draw a crate and write on it a mark which makes another mark when it is upside down.\" I never liked 'Len and the River Mob'.The social realism always depressed me. 'The Boy From Space' was more my cup of tea, and it was in colour.I shall keep the momentum going on the book-logging front, so I hope that I'll have some more interesting titles for a future post. In the meantime, here is a wonderful author photo from an earlier period:"},
{"title": "The Island of Misadventure", "date": "Tuesday, September 10, 2013", "text": "I have had an obsession with islands for as long as I can remember. I've no idea why, but I suspect that a childhood diet of Famous Five books (and, of course, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader) made me yearn for a self-contained world where the grown-ups couldn't spoil things.It came as a great disappointment to discover that Dorset's Kirrin Island only existed in Enid Blyton's imagination and that on the whole, England was rather short of islands. But there was one island on the map that always captured my imagination: Lundy.Two hours' sailing time from the nearest port, the three-mile-long Lundy Island has been home to generations of pirates, adventurers and exiles. It's a bleak, desolate place, like a huge slab of moorland that has been dropped into the sea, buffeted by fierce storms from the Atlantic. But it also has a rare, unspoiled beauty that some find addictive.Six days ago I travelled to Ilfracombe and caught this boat, which offers the only regular service to Lundy: I'd been warned about the notoriously rough crossing, so I put Sibelius on standby and grabbed a seat in the middle of the ship. But when we reached open waters, the sea was still like a millpond and people were consuming greasy bacon rolls with impunity.I went up on deck and waited for the hazy profile of Lundy to appear. At first, it seemed deceptively smooth and flat, but as the ship edged closer, a more hostile coastline emerged. With few landing places, this austere outcrop of granite has been cursed by generations of seafarers.But one small part of the island is different. When we arrived, the clear, blue waters of the bay and the suntrap of Millcombe Valley reminded me of holidays in Greece:There is even a white villa, built by one of Lundy's former owners:However, the sub-Mediterranean appearance of this small, sheltered microclimate is deceptive. Once you reach the top of the island, the landscape changes abruptly and a sharp wind hits you:Lundy Island has attracted its fair share of ne'er do wells and one of the most notorious was an 18th century gentleman called Thomas Benson. Paid by the authorities to transport convicts to America, he took them as far as Lundy, where they were then forced to work as slaves, building walls like the one above.When challenged, Benson argued that he was under contract to remove the convicts from English soil and had kept his end of the bargain. In fact, Benson had been paid to take the convicts to Maryland and Virginia. It was one of many acts of fraud that ended with Benson fleeing to Portugal to escape the gallows.In the 18th century, Lundy was a rat-infested island, occupied by three farming families who constantly squabbled with each other. Today it is a rat-free, middle class utopia, with understated, tastefully-furnished cottages built from granite.This is where I stayed:I couldn't fault my accommodation. With a sea view, a generous supply of books, mostly Victorian furniture and a beautiful bone china tea set, all of my needs were met. But I had some reservations about the local water supply:I'm told that you can drink it. I didn't.There's no television, radio or internet access and at midnight, the electricity goes off for six hours, so it is a rather monastic existence. But I can think of worse things in the world than sitting in total silence with nothing to do except read.I can't remember the last time I slept in complete darkness, but woke up feeling as if I'd been asleep for days and was ready to tackle the island. I threw a few things into a backpack and locked the door behind me, wondering if keys were necessary on this crime-free island.I'd noticed that everyone on the boat was wearing expensive hiking gear and felt slightly self-conscious that I looked as if I was going out for a drink in Stoke Newington. But did I really need to spend a fortune on equipment? This was Lundy, not Everest.In today's consumer society, we're persuaded that it's an act of reckless folly to leave the safety of the pavement without buying specially designed clothing. It's not enough for walking shoes to fit. They now have to be both waterproof and breatheable, with built-in shock absorbers and arch support.My Royal Mail-surplus shoes didn't have an 'ortholite anatomical footbed' or a 'Vibram axis sole', but as I started my 90-minute walk to the northernmost point of Lundy, I didn't feel at a disadvantage. If it rained, I had an old kagool somewhere in the bottom of my backpack.I began with a visit to a disused lighthouse, where I'd be able to get my bearings and work out where I was going. From here, you can see every part of the island: The owners of Lundy have thoughtfully added deck chairs, so the following day I took a book and spent a very enjoyable hour listening to howling wind:As you can see, there are no safety barriers and the circular platform is surrounded by a sheer drop, but on Lundy the prevailing philosophy is that people are responsible for their own safety. In some ways, Lundy fulfills the childhood fantasy of a world without grown-ups, as there are no policemen, civil servants or government officials here. Once I'd checked my map against the view and made sure that I wasn't holding it upside down, I set off along the western side of the island. There is nothing between this coastline and Newfoundland, so it gets a little windy. In the past, cattle have been blown into the sea and ships dashed against the rocks. I took extra care when walking along the cliff edge:When a neighbour heard that I'd gone to Lundy, she cheerfully replied that the husband of a friend had fallen off a cliff there and died. \"Mind you,\" she added \"He did have some mental health issues, so he might have jumped.\"Perhaps the poor man did jump, but walking along this coastline I could see how easy it would be to lose your footing, particularly in wet weather. Whenever I stopped to take a photo, I reminded myself not to absent-mindedly step backwards. I imagined accidentally plunging to my doom and people concluding that I'd \"been under a lot of stress recently.\"As I looked at the dark, granite cliffs and listened to the lonely cry of the gulls, I was reminded of the Anglo-Saxon poem 'The Seafarer'.  With lines like \"There I heard nothing but the roaring sea...\" and \"Storms there beat the stony cliffs, where the tern spoke, icy-feathered...\" it could have been written here.There is a thin line between solitude and loneliness and on Lundy, I crossed it.I thought of Sir Lewis Stukeley, who lost his mind on Lundy. In the reign of King James I, Stukeley betrayed his cousin Sir Walter Raleigh, partly for financial gain, but also motivated by a long-held grudge. Stukeley gained favour with the King, but earned the contempt of his peers and was ostracised by everyone at Court. Broken by the experience, he fled to Lundy.Here is an extract from Charles Kingsley's wonderful account of Stukeley's demise: \"A terrible plebiscitum had been passed in the West country against the betrayer of its last Worthy.        The gentlemen closed their doors against him; the poor refused him - so goes the legend -        fire and water. Driven by the Furies, he fled from Affeton, and wandered westward down the        vale of Taw, away to Appledore, and there took boat, and out into the boundless Atlantic,        over the bar, now crowded with shipping, for which Raleigh's genius had discovered a new        trade and a new world.              Sixteen miles to the westward, like a blue cloud on the horizon, rises the ultima Thule of Devon, the little isle of        Lundy. There one outlying peak of granite, carrying up a shelf of slate upon its southern        flank, has defied the waves, and formed an island some three miles long, desolate,        flat-headed, fretted by every frost and storm, walled all round with four hundred feet of        granite cliff, sacred only, then at least, to puffins and pirates. Over the single        landing-place frowns from the cliff the keep of an old ruin, 'Marisco Castle,' as they call        it still, where some bold rover, Sir John de Marisco, in the times of the old Edwards,        worked his works of darkness: a grey, weird, uncanny pile of moorstone, through which all the winds of heaven howl day and night.      In a chamber of that ruin died Sir Lewis Stukeley, Lord of Affeton, cursing God and man.\"I continued walking along the coast and actually felt grateful when I saw three figures in the distance:These gentlemen looked as if they had shares in Berghaus and were ready for all weathers. I felt slightly underprepared and looked anxiously at the darkening sky, but I hadn't realised how quickly the weather could change on Lundy: All it takes is a bit of blue sky to make me feel as if I'm on holiday instead of being in an Anglo-Saxon poem. Perhaps I should try the Canary Islands next time.This is one of three walls that mark out the quarter, half and three-quarter points on Lundy. If you're a fan of drystone walling, you'll like Lundy.I thought that this view was quite spectacular. If it was on the mainland, I expect someone would be charging us £15 for the privilege of seeing it, whilst offering Lundy Rock Shortbread (made in Wolverhampton) in the obligatory gift shop. There would probably also be some sort of branding, telling us that we were in a 'heritage area'.Fortunately, Lundy is owned by the Landmark Trust, who have managed to exploit the island's commercial potential as an unsual holiday destination, whilst leaving its unique character undamaged.If you're a misanthropist or need to finish that difficult second novel, this cottage offers splendid isolation:But don't write the novel on a laptop. There's no electricity.The northern point of Lundy was a bit of an anticlimax - the land just stopped. But then I noticed some rather crude steps that led down to a small peninsula with a lighthouse. I made my way down very tentatively and was dismayed to find that at the last step, there was another flight of steps. I hate heights.Halfway down, I had a blood sugar crisis, everything started to go dark and I learned the full meaning of the expression about legs turning into jelly. I found a level surface where I wouldn't roll into the sea, ate a banana and took deep, slow breaths. I hadn't seen anyone for an hour and there was no mobile signal. I was on my own.Suddenly, the oppressive infrastructure of 21st century Britain, with its CCTV cameras and dedicated hotlines for people \"affected by these issues\", looked more attractive. Briefly.But after ten minutes, I began to feel better and slowly made my way back. If I was going to pass out, I wanted to be somewhere reasonably horizontal. But the moment I reached the top, I started to feel better. I know what Freud would say.I walk back along the eastern side of Lundy. Towards the south, there are the remants of an ill-fated attempt to establish a quarry on Lundy: The quarry company was one of several enterprises that ended in failure. Lundy has seen many hopeful new owners end their lives in despair and bankruptcy. Today, a number of buildings are in ruins, covered in nettles and ferns.But the failed quarrying enterprise has left one positive legacy. This small pool offers a refuge from the Atlantic winds and, like a London park, has its own stock of ducks and fish:To conclude, I'd warmly recommend Lundy to anyone who wants a respite from Facebook updates, breaking news, 24/7 and too many choices of coffee. If you feel that the zeitgeist is the shitegeist, you'll probably like Lundy.They also have seals.Here is a montage of my trip to Lundy. It's slightly depressing how over an hour of video footage can be compressed to three minutes and still be boring, but at least the music's nice:"},

{"title": "Ever Decreasing Circles", "date": "Wednesday, August 14, 2013", "text": "My phone rang today. Nobody ever phones me, apart from my wife, who likes to find things for me to do. I was almost grateful until I heard the unmistakeable acoustic of an Indian call centre: \"Hi, I'm Steve MacDonald phoning from BT...\"They have phoned before. Each time, the caller has a strange, fake American accent that sounds like Stephen Hawking's voice simulator. Why would they train their staff to speak like that? Perhaps it's part of a cunning plan to seemlessly replace people with machines in a few years.I politely ended the call and was plunged back into silence.During the last month or so, I've found myself becoming increasingly nostalgic about the days when I was a bookshop manager. I think I miss the company of other people. Yesterday, my only visitor was a ram, which ambled nonchalantly around the shelving units before making a sudden, desperate bolt when it saw me.But would I really want to go back? I know that it must be miserable running a bookshop these days, watching the sales gradually decrease each year. Amazon should just buy Waterstones and rename the shops 'Amazon Showroom'.Sometimes I think of applying for a part-time job in an office. I'm not sure what I'd do, but I enjoyed the project management aspect of my last job and felt that I was reasonably good at it. It would be nice to work somewhere where my companions had opposing thumbs.However, my alarm bells rang when a friend told me that in her former workplace, the boss had introduced a 'Onesie Wednesday'. Apparently, everyone in the office was expected to wear one of these:Great if you like 'onesies'. Embarrassing and deeply offensive if you don't. I'd forgotten about the growing tendency for socially inept people in management to insist that their staff routinely humiliate themselves through 'team building' activities. Ironically, it's a mental health charity. How depressing.I suppose I mustn't complain about my working environment. How many jobs offer you the opportunity to watch two middle-aged men half-heartedly dismantle a grain silo? Another setback for the British space programmeBut aside from the isolation, I'm worried that I might not be able to live by books alone. Sales have been rather slow recently and although I could blame it on the good weather, I also wonder if the secondhand book market is beginning to feel the effects of the Kindle.When valuing books, I've noticed that an increasing number of backlist titles have been digitised. Ebooks may not be able to compete with my gorgeous, clothbound editions, but most of my stock veers towards the mankier side of tolerable, selling to people who just want the text at the cheapest price.There is nothing to stop Amazon from making sure that their Kindle versions undercut every other copy on sale.My other concern is about the supply chain. At the moment, there is a thriving 'penny book' business on Amazon and eBay, fuelled by donations to charity shops and book banks (my stock is the waste product of those businesses, as many people find non-barcoded books too labour-intensive).However, as sales to continue to migrate to the ebook format - particularly for paperback fiction - the penny book market's future must surely have a limited lifespan.Of course people will still want books, but the number who prefer print won't be enough to sustain the industry at its current level. The specialist antiquarian booksellers are safe, but the rest of us are probably in trouble.I feel as if I ought to start developing a Plan B."},
{"title": "Three Quotes", "date": "Sunday, August 11, 2013", "text": "This isn't really a blog post, but just three quotes that struck me during the last week. They are all far longer than 140 characters, so Tweeting wasn't an option:1941 - Czechoslovakia\"Some Czech workmen are on the roof of the Opera House in Prague in order to take down a statue of Mendelssohn, the composer, because he's a Jew. The order has come directly from Heydrich, recently named Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, and a connoisseur of classical music. But there's a whole row of statues on the roof, and Heydrich hasn't specified which is Mendelssohn. Now, apart from Heydrich it seems that nobody - even the Germans - is capable of recognising the Jewish composer. But nobody dares disturb Heydrich just for that. So the SS guards decide to point out the statue with the biggest nose. Well, they're looking for a Jew, aren't they? But - disaster! - the statue the workmen start to remove is actually Wagner!\"- Laurent Binet, 'HHhH'1932 - Russia\"Much blood has been shed, hundreds of atrocities have been committed, and the spirit of destruction has breathed over the country (Russia). But in my heart of hearts, I feel it would be superficial and untrue to dismiss the whole Bolshevik regime in terms of violence and rapine. It strikes me as being all very simple, and yet highly complex in all its aspects, in all its form; I see something profoundly Russian, an ugliness essentially Russian in the mixture of folly and cruelty.I should be blind and prejudiced if I did not recognise that to Lenin and some of his associates the Bolshevik movement was an attempt to re-create life on a fairer basis. They were definitely not \"mere thieves and brigands.\" The tragedy lay in the fact that our Russian architects were not content to build an ordinary human edifice on a reasonable scale; nothing less than a \"tower defying the heavens\"  a Tower of Babel would do for them...They were not satisfied with the steady progress of the man who goes to and fro between his work and his home - they must rush headlong towards the future. \"Down with the old world!\" was the general outcry, and so the old world needs to be swept away, lock stock and barrel.Thus it came about that every human quality, like a medal, showed its reverse side. \"Liberty\" became tyranny; \"fraternity\" civil war: \"equality\" ended in the thrusting down of any head that dared to lift itself above the level of the morass.\"- Feodor Chaliapin, Man and Mask2013 - USA\"Aaronsontells me he's shocked by the number of kids he knows who believe the Jews werebehind 9/11. \"The problem with this demographic is that they do not knowthe basic narratives of their histories – or really any narratives,\" hesays. \"They're blazed on pot and searching the Internet for any 'factoids'that they believe fit their highly de-historicized and decontextualizedideologies. And the adult world totally misunderstands them and dismisses them– and does so at our collective peril,\" he adds.\" - Janet Reitman, Rolling Stone MagazineThe first quote comes from one of the best books I've read this year. The second is from an autobiography that I recently discovered in a box of titles from a house clearance. The final quote sums up my frustration with my son's blind faith in the veracity of YouTube videos (fortunately, he has a healthy cynicism about the lizard people and most 9/11 conspiracy theories). You can read Janet Reitman's full article on the Boston bombers by clicking on the link above."},
{"title": "The Seven Year Itch", "date": "Thursday, August 08, 2013", "text": "In a couple of days, this blog will be seven years old. From what I've read that's unusual, as many blogs reach the end of their natural life much earlier. That said, I'm aware that this blog doesn't have the youthful vigour it possessed three years ago. If it was a person, this blog would be in a care home, aware that the best was probably over.When I first discovered the world of blogging, ten years ago, I thought it was an absurd idea. Why would any strangers want to know about the minutiae of my life, or care what I thought about a particular book? I regarded blogging as a harmless but futile pastime.I was reasonably contented managing a bookshop and although it wasn't always terribly stimulating, I had other projects that stopped me from becoming bored. In my spare time, I researched and wrote material about authors for an intranet site and had also begun to train as a Justice of the Peace.I was very upset when I discovered that as a magistrate, I wouldn't be required to wear a wigNaively, I thought that life would just tick along. At some point I'd move to another bookshop and my son would go to secondary school, but apart from a few grey hairs, little would change.But a couple of years later, things began to unravel. My father died, my wife discovered that she was pregnant, the company I worked for was taken over and we began to have the first inkling that something wasn't quite right with my oldest son.This time seven years ago, my wife had taken our sons to stay with her mother for a couple of weeks so that I could decorate the house. I think I must have painted half a wall before I began to feel the first signs of the worst food poisoning I've ever experienced. I was in bed for nearly two weeks.During my convalescence I spent many hours aimlessly surfing the internet. At some point I stumbled across Blogger and out of curiosity, decided to see if I could create a blog page. I casually decided to call it 'The Age of Uncertainty', as it seemed apposite, then wrote a short post and published it.For better or worse, this blog has nothing to do with John Kenneth GalbraithPerhaps that would have been the end of it. However, someone posted a comment and I was so surprised and delight that a stranger had read what I'd written, thought about it and given an interesting reply, I felt compelled to try again.I soon discovered that I was wrong about blogging. It wasn't simply another form of vanity publishing, but rather a new way of connecting with like-minded people whose lives I would have been blissfully unaware of in the pre-internet age. The thoughtful comments, helpful suggestions and sympathetic responses from others have enriched my life. Thanks to the kindness of strangers, I have discovered different authors, visited new places and made a few friends.I think that  this blog was at its peak when I worked in my last job, as I had a wealth of material to write about and share. I find blogging far more difficult these days, partly because I no longer have access to dozens of photo albums and diaries, but also because I'm now self-employed and feel that I should spend as much time as possible trying to earn some money. The book business ticks along, just, but I hover on the edge of penury.Also, I find it difficult to write an entertaining blog when my home life is so dysfunctional. The highlights of the last month have been cancelling a holiday, having a kitten put down and trying to persuade my oldest son to leave the house for more than five minutes. I suppose I could extract some black humour from recent events, but I'd rather not.In light of everything that's happened, I've been wondering if I should continue to maintain this blog. I worry that it has become a disappointment to the people who began to follow it in the days of the Derek diaries and the Victorian photo albums.However, I'm not quite ready to give up.I don't want to stop blogging for two reasons. First, I  really enjoy reading people's comments, which are always kind, thoughtful and incisive. Second, the act of writing a blog post is nearly always an enjoyable journey into the unknown. For example, when I did a little research for a recent post about Arnold Bennett, I discovered a great article by someone I'd never heard of called Wendy Lesser and looked her up on Google. A week later, I was reading a wonderful book that she'd written about Shostakovich.I think the answer is to continue, even if it's only once or twice a month. If circumstances change, then perhaps I can breathe new life into the ailing patient. In the meantime, here is a picture of the winner of the European royalty Buddy Holly lookalike competition:"},

{"title": "Going Back For Air", "date": "Monday, July 22, 2013", "text": "In literature and film, the general consensus seems to be that it is a mistake to revisit the past. Places and  people change. Any attempt to return to the scene of a long-cherished memory can only end in tears, like poor old George Bowling's return to his childhood home in Orwell's Coming Up For Air.But like a fool, on Friday I set off on a six-hour journey to Wales for a reunion at my old university college. There would be people there I hadn't seen since T'Pau were in the charts. Would I recognise them? Would they recognise me?The journey didn't begin well. I almost ran over a cat and my car's air conditioning stopped working (I'm not suggesting a causal relationship between the two events). By the time I joined the M25 the temperature had already hit 30 degrees and the traffic had slowed down to 25mph. At this rate, I would reach Lampeter in eleven hours if I hadn't died of heatstroke first.However, although the car was hot, the music was cool, particularly this little number:I made up for lost time on the M4, briefly entering hyperspace somewhere between Membury and Swindon. My impossible journey was now looking more hopeful. Perhaps I would reach Wales before nightfall.When I finally left the motorway, somehere near Carmarthen, I found myself in countryside that was even more beautiful than I remembered, with lush, verdant valleys and densely-wooded hills. I was now in Welsh-speaking Wales and passed through villages with names that defeated my satnav lady: Llanllwni, Llanybydder, Maesycrugiau...In Coming Up For Air, George Bowling is horrified to discover that the idyllic village of his boyhood has been transformed into a town of drab, modern housing estates and I wondered what I would find as I turned the corner at Cwmann and entered Lampeter. I needn't have worried:Saint David's University College is the smallest campus the Britain, with a mere 750 students in a town with a population of around 3,500. I chose to go there because I wanted to experience something that was as far removed from my life in suburban London as possible. It was in Lampter that I learned the meaning of the the old Chinese proverb about being careful what you wished for.Lampeter was very cut-off. The nearest city was 50 miles away and the town lacked a cinema, Indian restaurant or bookshop, so it wasn't exactly buzzing with life. Sundays were particularly grim, as the local authority was dominated by religious zealots who decreed that the pubs were not allowed to open.But the plus side of the size and remoteness of Lampeter was that it was easy to get to know people and lack of local entertainment inspired some very creative solutions from the students (mostly alcohol-related, I'm afraid to say).Saint David's attracted several categories of student. Some were there because they hadn't got the grades they needed to be accepted by the university of their choice, including of small contingent of Oxbridge rejects who were attracted by the architectural similarities with Christ Church college in Oxford.A few chose Lampeter because of its long tradition as a theological college, training generation after generation of Anglican clergymen. Indeed, the SDUC rugby team was still known as the 'Vicars'.Others, like me, were attracted by the University's rural setting and its rather eccentric character (I turned down the chance to study in a 'better' place because I hated the Brutalist architecture of the campus).There was nowhere quite like Lampeter.My weekend visit could have been a salutory lesson about the dangers of nostalgia for the George Bowlings of this world, but it turned out to be the most enjoyable thing I've done for a long time. Sitting outside the Union Bar at 1.00 in the morning, drinking with friends and people I hadn't seen since Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister, I realised how happy I was.It wasn't about going back. We had lived our lives all over again and weren't the people we were, but because we had all gone through something together at an important time in our past, I felt a deep affection towards everyone I met (along with a even deeper gratitude that they all recognised me).At some point in the evening, we were joined by someone I never knew well but always liked, known as 'Earl Grey'. He had clearly been drinking for quite a while and showed no intention of slowing down, so I was rather surprised when he casually announced that he was being married by a druid in three hours' time. \"I think he's in a car somewhere nearby. We're having a bit of a party tomorrow. You should all come along...it's not far.\"The Earl rattled off an set of directions which I knew would lead to disaster (I've learned to be wary of anyone who uses the phrase \"You can't miss it\"), so I got out my smartphone and asked him to point his house out on Google Earth. He couldn't find it and we ended up with a name and an instruction to turn left.The following morning, we were in a dilemma. Would the Earl remember inviting us? He was quite drunk. But on the other hand, if Earl Grey was expecting us, it would be rude not to make an appearance. We decided to go and after a slightly challenging journey, found him drinking tea in his garden:IEarl Grey gestured to us to sit down at a wooden table and as I was thinking what a nice little garden he had, it gradually transpired that he also owned the adjoining fields and a river. The Earl gave us a tour of his land, which included a cider making facility, bee hives, an orchard, a caravan and the site of a medieval building.I don't usually fall victim to envy, but it was hard not to be impressed:Earl Grey even has his own sword in a stone, albeit a slightly rusty one: And he built the bridge in the background. We sat by the river, with John Renbourn playing gently in the background, next to a table laid with grapes, bread and cheese. I think I must be a bit of an old hippy at heart, as this seemed like paradise: But Earl Grey's estate is a mere suburban garden, compared to his friend Paul, who is also an ex-Lampeter student. When Paul left university, he tried a number a jobs, including working at Threshers in Putney, but had a hankering to go back to Wales. Once he'd made his mind up to return, he learned Welsh and took any job he could find until he had enough money to buy some land.Today, Paul owns ten acres of land, somewhere up a nearby mountain. Because his house is at a higher altitude, he gets snowed-in for at least two weeks longer than Earl Grey. It's a lifestyle that wouldn't suit everyone (he didn't get electricity until 2003), but he seems a contented man.I felt inspired by my visit to Earl Grey and, perhaps, a little dissatisfied with my pokey little house and its postage stamp-sized garden. They really were 'living the dream' and, unlike some English incomers, had made a real effort to integrate into the local community. I returned home a little misty-eyed, then my wife reminded me that it wasn't her dream and suggested I went there in February.In the evening I squeezed into an old dinner jacket for a Lampeter Society dinner and had a very enjoyable time. After several difficult months, it was a tonic to be with old friends again and I left feeling as if I'd come back from a very long holiday.I realise that it can be a mistake to revisit the past, but last weekend I learned that it can be an even bigger mistake to turn your back on it."},
{"title": "Mrs Woolf and Mr Bennett", "date": "Tuesday, July 02, 2013", "text": "During a recent illness, I had to spend a few days in bed and quickly became very bored. After an unrewarding browse through Twitter, I remembered how much comfort I'd derived from reading Of Human Bondage the year before and decided that what I needed was a big, Edwardian doorstep of a novel. But what?On Google searches, the name 'Arnold Bennett' frequently appeared, but each time I dismissed him without a moment's consideration. The very idea! But why was I so prejudiced against a novelist who had once been called \"the English Zola\"? I couldn't quite remember.In an excellent New York Times article, Who's Afraid of Arnold Bennett?, Wendy Lesser neatly sums up the problem with Bennett:\"I have an experiment for you to try. The next time you're at a literary gathering, ask 10 people whether they've ever read Arnold Bennett. Now, by ''literary gathering'' I do not mean your run-of-the-mill publisher's cocktail party, your average book award ceremony. For the experiment to work, you have to choose a group consisting of people who actually read -- anti-Derridean English professors, say, or poets over the age of 40, or freelance writers who pack Trollope novels in their vacation luggage.Even in such a narrowly selected group, I predict, no more than one in ten will have read an Arnold Bennett novel. One or two will honestly confess they've never heard of him; another two or three will say his name sounds vaguely familiar. But fully half your sample is likely to pipe up with the information that though they haven't read Bennett himself, they have read Virginia Woolf's 1924 essay ''Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown.'' And that essay, they will suggest, made it abundantly clear that there was no need ever to read Arnold Bennett. I find it disturbing that Virginia Woolf, the possessor of an intense but extremely limited form of genius, should have been able, in the course of just 60 or 70 years, to crowd a great novelist like Arnold Bennett right off the literary map. It is as if you had planted a delightfully unusual ground cover in your garden, only to discover some years later that its rampant spread had killed your favorite oak. (Well, not oak, exactly. Charles Dickens is an oak. Bennett is more like an unruly old apple tree: he could use some pruning, but the fruit is delicious.\" After reading the Clayhanger trilogy, I couldn't agree more. I'd always lumped Arnold Bennett in with contemporaries like Hugh Walpole - by all accounts, an average writer of middlebrow fiction. But although the trilogy itself isn't a masterpiece, the first part certainly comes close.I hadn't read Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown, but Woolf's 24-page essay is available here and it's interesting how she flatters Bennett with faint praise before going for the jugular, using his own assertion about the importance over character over plot to highlight his supposed inadequacies as a novelist.According to Virginia Woolf, Arnold Bennett is too preocuupied with extraneous details to ever get to the heart of a character. In Hilda Lessways - the middle and arguably least successful novel of the Clayhanger trilogy - the characters of Hilda and her mother fail to establish themselves because the author is obsessed with bombarding the reader with facts about where they live:\"We cannot hear her mother's voice, or Hilda's voice; we can only hear Mr. Bennett's voice telling us facts about rents and freeholds and copyholds and fines. What is Mr. Bennett about? I have formed my own opinion of what Mr. Bennett is about - he is trying to make us imagine for him; he is trying to hypnotise us into the belief that because he has made a house, there must be a person living there.\"This would be more convincing if there was no Clayhanger, but in Hilda Lessways, the heroine is already a firmly-established character. Why has Woolf picked the middle book in a trilogy to prove her point? I can't help feeling that the literary feud between Woolf and Bennett was mainly a consequence of their different social backgrounds.For Virginia Woolf, \"facts about rents and freeholds\" may have been superfluous, but Arnold Bennett knew that to people on a low income, they were anything but. Born in a lower class family, Bennett endured a brief and unhappy spell as a rent collector in Stoke on Trent and saw how people were thwarted by circumstances, slaves to the whims of the local economy.Perhaps Woolf viewed the working class as a separate species - noble (and ignoble) savages - rather than just people whose characters had only been allowed to grow in a very small pot, limited by lack of money and opportunity. To describe their lives without mentioning the details of their homes, the clothes they wore and the rents they paid would be absurd.It is tempting to imagine a northern, working class version of Mrs. Dalloway (perhaps Mrs. Dalloby), but I don't think there would be much time in the day for any stream of consciousness.Of course, Woolf had her own demons to contend with, but they were not financial. Her success as a writer and, later, a feminist icon, was partly achieved because of the freedoms Woolf's monied background provided. While Woolf sat in her 'room of own's one', contemplating the finer points of Elizabethan drama or the Brontes, Nellie Bloxall was busy cooking, cleaning, making the beds and emptying the chamber pots.Arnold Bennett began his literary career began under very different circumstances and although he eventually became financially secure, he never lost the habit of one who has to write for a living, remaining an artisan in the literary world. If Clayhanger was all about lists and facts, it would be a very dull book indeed, but the reality is a novel that succeeds on two fronts, creating a broad canvas that vividly evokes the Stoke-on-Trent of the late Victorian age, with a cast of characters who are credible and sympathetic. It took me a little while to become fully engaged with the narrative, but I found the final three quarters of the novel utterly compelling.Why did Bennett go out of fashion? Did the Woolfs and Leavis's of this world really exert such a strong influence on the reading public? Perhaps Arnold Bennett simply committed the unpardonable sin of being too prolific, publishing mediocre novels as well as good. I also wonder if big, chunky, traditional novels, by working class northerners with bad teeth, are less attractive than slim, experimental, impressionistic ones, by frail-looking aesthetes.John Carey, in his highly entertaining book The Intellectuals and the Masses, hails Bennett as a hero and suggests that Woolf and company deliberately cultivated a style that would be inaccessible to the 'wrong' sort of people:\"The intellectuals could not, of course, actually prevent the masses from attaining literacy. But they could prevent them reading literature by making it too difficult to understand.\"Carey also believes that Arnold Bennett's literary fate was sealed because:\"His writings represent a systematic dismemberment of the intellectuals' case against the masses.\"Clayhanger was a revelation and I look forward to read more Bennett. According to Wendy Lesser, The Old Wives' Tale is his masterpiece, but I've also read good reviews of Riceyman Steps and Anna of the Five Towns.I'll leave the last word to Mr. Bennett himself:\"A cause can be inconvenient, but it's magnificent. It's like champagne or high heels, and one must be prepared to suffer for it.\""},
{"title": "All Tomorrow's Parties", "date": "Thursday, June 27, 2013", "text": "I was in Smith's earlier today, waiting for my wife to buy a present for a child's seventh birthday party. There seem to be more parties than there are children in my son's class. I don't understand it, particularly as he doesn't socialise with half of them.My youngest son goes to a standard state primary school and I'd say that the social mix between the middle classes and what my German neighbour coyly refers to as 'people from social housing' is about 50-50. As a middle class person who grew up in a working class family, I have watched the interactions of these two groups with interest.At first it all seems to be going very well. At the age of four, the children all happily play together and although the mothers separate into different groups from the word go, there is still a sense of community and the party invitations are blind to any social divisions.The middle class mothers might shudder with horror when Coca Cola is served at little Jordan's 5th birthday. They might also cringe at food that has more 'e's than the Hacienda Club in 1990 and worry that Sasha's manic dancing to 'Jive Bunny' is the result of consuming too additives. But they grin nervously and remind themselves to be otherwise enaged in a year's time.The non-middle class mother are equally non-plussed by Sasha's party, which seems a joyless occasion consisting of activities that look like schoolwork, inedible, tasteless food and music that has never been in the charts. When Jordan is handed a plate of hummus and pitta bread, he looks as if he is going to cry.And, as Kurt Vonnegut would say, so it goes. Gradually, the unspoken apartheid between the classes becomes more entrenched and the party invitations become more selective. It's all rather depressing. I've tried crossing the invisible lines, but I always end up sounding like Prince Charles visiting an inner city community centre.But I digress. During my long wait in WH Smith's, I took a look at the books and felt an overwhelming sense of relief that I no longer had to sell new books. Browsing through the endless celebrity biographies, sub-Twilight/50 Shades/Da Vinci genre novels and dull, midlist fiction was an incredibly depressing experience. I'd forgotten how much I hated it all.Selling secondhand books on the internet has its own challenges, but at least the selection of titles I sell is constantly changing and completely random. It's so refreshing to be able to discover new books every day, rather than putting yet another pile of Victoria Hislop's 'The Island' on the paperback bestsellers table.However, I wonder how much mileage my business has. The way people read is radically changing and although there will probably always be a place for the printed page, I worry that the supply will begin to exceed the demand, driving prices down to an unsustainable level. I don't know what I'll do if that happens.If I sound slightly gloomy, it's partly because we've discovered that our new kitten - the one we bought to cheer our oldest son up - is dying. He has Feline Infectious Peritonitis and is slowly fading away, getting thinner every week. I know it's only a cat, but we've grown rather fond of him, as he's an exceptionally affectionate little creature. I feel particularly sorry for my son, as this experience has just reinforced his already pessimistic view of the world, instead of effecting a positive change. When a suitable period of time has elapsed, we'll get a new cat and hope for better luck next time.By the end of last week, I was beginning to feel a little battle-fatigued, so I decided to brush away the cobwebs with a visit to the Shard. I thought the London Eye was impressive, but the view from here is in a class of its own:It's just like flying (although EasyJet is probably cheaper). Indeed, a nearby plane seemed to be at a similar altitude, which was slightly disconcerting.Afterwards, I wandered through the streets of Southwark, where my grandfather was born in the 1890s, gatecrashing a boy scouts' church service in the cathedral. One man sang 'Oh Worship the King' so badly that several very solemn-looking dignitaries started to get the giggles.  I finished with a visit to the Tate Modern - a gallery that never fails to disappoint. I loved the Tate when it when first opened - the 'space' was very impressive. But these days I'd like to see a little less space and a lot more exhibits.I'm not sure what the point of this rambling blog post was, other than trying to add content after a long gap. I can't blame alcohol this time, as I've been drinking nothing but tea all afternoon.That reminds me, I think the sun's over the yardarm..."},

{"title": "Middle England", "date": "Thursday, June 13, 2013", "text": "Today I set off on another futile quest to find some stock for my business, driving 135 miles to a meeting that lasted for five minutes. The address sounded promising enough and I envisaged a vast industrial estate. Instead, I arrived here:I've no idea why this building is on stilts, at such a precarious angle. Perhaps I should have asked. I was met by a woman with a very territorial dog, who showed me a pitiful selection of books. I tried to seem enthusiastic, but I think she could tell that my heart wasn't in it. I got back in the car and drove past a sign that read \"POLISH CAMP. PRIVATE. KEEP OUT.\" Then my satnav died.After driving aimlessly for a few miles, I pulled over and stopped the car. I had no idea where I was, except that I was somewhere in Bedfordshire.I've never really liked Bedfordshire. The countryside is generally flat and dull and its two main towns - Luton and Bedford - are twinned with Hell and Purgatory. However I was impressed that somewhere which had seemed over-developed and urbanised could still contain so many miles of remote, slightly menacing countryside.With a growing sense of desperation, I fiddled with the power lead of my satnav until it suddenly sprang into life, telling me I was nowhere. Was this a fault or an upgrade? I turned the engine on and started driving.Just as I was thinking horrible thoughts about Bedfordshire, I passed through a town that actually looked quite pleasant:I was in Olney, a place I had never heard of. Most of the buildings were pre-20th century and had been made out of this attractive local stone:I parked  the car and discovered a very likeable town, full of quirky, unusual buildings, hidden courtyards and little touches of civic pride that revealed a lot about its inhabitants. I didn't see a single piece of graffiti. Bedfordshire had redeemed itself.Then I discovered that I was in Buckinghamshire.The one thing that spoiled Olney was the traffic. The A509 cuts right through the heart of the town and the buildings shake as juggernauts hurtle past. Looking at Olney on Google Earth, I can see that the town is surrounded by flat fields of no particular merit, so perhaps this is one of those rare occasions when a bypass is justified.After Olney, I made a slight detour to Bletchley Park, home of the World War Two codebreakers:I'd always thought that Bletchley Park was a remote country house. It probably was once, but since the War it has been slowly enveloped by the urban sprawl of Milton Keynes - a new town with an impressive number of roundabouts. The entrance to Bletchley Park is now opposite a large office building with blackened windows. The actual museum of Bletchley Park is a rather disparate collection of exhibitions, mainly housed in outbuildings. Some of the exhibits are fascinating, whilst others have a more specialist appeal (I'm afraid that I have a limited interest in the use of pigeons for espionage).But whether you're interested in the subject or not - and I have to admit that there are only so many encryption machines that I want to see in an afternoon - it is hard not to be impressed by the sheer ingenuity of the codebreakers. The dazzling complexity of these machines made my head hurt:A very earnest man tried to explain how these machines worked and I nodded and smiled knowingly, hoping that I'd be able to sneak off before he realised that I hadn't a clue what he was talking about. I think the gist of what he was saying was about how these machines took a code that had 128 trillion possible permutations and reduced it down to a more manageable number of alternatives. Thousands, possibly millions of lives were saved as a result.Before I finished my visit, I had to see the ultimate codebreaking machine: Alan Turing's Colossus computer:I left feeling inspired and very humbled. I thought I was reasonably intelligent, but if I'd been responsible for breaking the Enigma code, we would have probably still been at war in 1952.As much as I enjoyed Bletchley Park, I think I'll have a break from visiting remote industrial estates for the time being."},
{"title": "Meetings With Unremarkable Men", "date": "Thursday, June 06, 2013", "text": "This morning I set off on a 140-mile journey, for a meeting that I knew was probably going to be a complete waste of time.It was my fault. I'd approached a recycling company to see if they had any books that they'd like to sell and this prompted an exchange of emails with someone who clearly wasn't terribly proficient in the English language. He seemed very keen to meet, but each new reply convinced me that he hadn't quite understood where I was, what I did  or what it was I wanted.Perhaps I should have cancelled. But it goes against the grain to turn down any opportunity, however slim. In the end, with a heavy heart, I emailed to say that I would visit them this morning.The journey was straightforward enough until I arrived at the town and wasted half an hour looking for an unmarked industrial estate.The recycling company occupied a building which looked like a tertiary college that had been abandoned after a nuclear accident, with long, unlit corridors and vast walls of peeling paint. It would have made a good headquarters for the warlord of a small, local militia.The meeting was farcical. After a brief chat in an office, we walked over to a warehouse where they proudly showed me rows of paperbacks. Although I had clearly mentioned - several times - that I was interested in buying old books, they seemed to be under the impression that I wanted to run their business selling modern paperbacks. I didn't know what to say.I tried to politely suggest that this wasn't a good idea, as I lived 140 miles away. Also, as I specialised in older books, I really wasn't the right man for the job. We looked at each other. I could sense that it wasn't going well.We returned to the office and I was invited to sit down, but instead of talking to me, my host started filing papers and feeding invoices into a machine. Were any of these forms pertinent to our meeting, or had it simply come to an end? Perhaps it was a cultural difference. I wasn't sure. I decided to make one last-ditch attempt to redeem myself: \"If you're throwing these books into a bin and selling them as waste paper, wouldn't it be better to separate them and sell them to me for a lot more money than you're getting now?\" There was a long silence, punctuated with more shuffling and filing of invoices. It was time to leave.It could have been a rather disheartening experience, but luckily I had a contingency plan in place: The village of Avebury, surrounded by a mysterious 6,000-year-old stone circle, was only eight miles away. My journey needn't be a wasted one. This stone almost looks like two faces. Perhaps that's why a woman with badly-hennared hair and a floaty skirt was placing her hands on the surface. 20 years ago, it was a lot worse. All sorts of people - mostly foreign - were hugging the stones and talking about \"feeling the energy\". Today, people were content to touch the stones with outstretched arms, rather like a polite handshake between strangers.Between two large stones, an earnest-looking woman addressed a small group, talking about a 'stargate'. At the back, two middle-aged men sniggered like naughty schoolboys: \"On no, not the Stargate!\" We exchanged knowing smiles.I walked around the edge of the village, avoiding the tree-huggers and seekers of ancient wisdom. It was now one o'clock in the afternoon and the sheep sought shelter from the glare of the sun:I followed the stones until I found myself in the centre of the village. Avebury seemed almost impossibly idyllic, but when I heard the plummy accents of the local shop assistants, I wondered if it had become one of those 'heritage' areas where inflated property prices had driven out the real villagers. Avebury Manor was splendid and reminded me of the late-1970s children television drama 'Children of the Stones', which was filmed in the village. I watched it on DVD a few years ago and if anything, found it even more impressive as an adult. The intelligent script, which didn't make any compromises for a younger audience, has never been surpassed by anything on children's television:Also, it had a wonderfully spooky intro sequence:The quest to explain the stones, either in an archeological or supernatural context, seems futile. We will probably never know their purpose and while it is fine to speculate, I'm perfectly happy to accept the stones on their own terms. They are extraordinary, beautiful and mysterious.I returned to my car and began the long, dull journey back to Lewes, but just as I thought I'd left Avebury behind me, I saw this:Had they been there an hour earlier? I really wasn't sure.I have more meetings lined up. Earlier in the year, I went into partnership with a man who ran several internet bookselling companies and it looked as if I would have a steady supply of stock of old books. However, he has decided to concentrate on his main business and after an amicable separation, I am back where I started.At the moment I am working alone. If we can ever get our oldest son back to school, my wife will join me. I don't know if our bookselling venture will ever amount to a decent living, but I am quietly hopeful.I intend to spend the summer finding new sources of stock, trawling the industrial estates of England. However, I suspect that there may also be some interesting detours as well, possibly with a few overnight stays.Any recommendations for West Yorkshire?"},

{"title": "Superferric", "date": "Tuesday, May 21, 2013", "text": "I have recently been decluttering at a rate that would give Michael Landy a run for his money. Some of it is an attempt to bring order to a life that feels increasingly chaotic, but I'm also increasingly aware that many of my possessions are neither beautiful or useful. I have been particularly brutal with my books, but I have no regrets. I spent the first ten years of my bookselling career gratefully accepting every proof copy that came my way, but only read a handful. The remainder - a collection of novels that were described by their publisher as 'lyrical' - served as a salutory reminder of the fate that awaits most first-time authors.(Bloomsbury used to be very good at taking a punt on a new or unknown author and I read two proofs of novels that I was certain would be shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Both failed miserably and a year later, one of the authors committed suicide) After a few days, I had boxes full of books and ephemera - ready for the charity shops of Lewes. I also had a dozen bin bags to take to the dump, several of which rattled with video tapes. However, there was one conspicuous absence: cassettes.For me, a TDK C-90 cassette is the equivalent of Proust's madeleines. The one at the top, with its Compact Cassette logo, the enigmatic promise of Normal Bias and the boxes to tick for noise reduction, evokes a lost world of 'radio cassette recorders', 'solid state' microphones and 'Dolby'.As an adolescent, I was obsessed with audio cassettes. Being able to tape programmes and songs was wonderful, but the real miracle was having the freedom to make my own recordings. Sadly, my parents didn't share my enthusiasm and regarded cassettes as an unnecessary luxury. As a result, I often had to tape over beloved recordings.Occasionally my parents would relent and return from Kingston market with cassettes made by companies with names like Bentronic or Wangui - five for a pound. Sadly, they would always produce recordings that sounded as if they had been made underwater.After a brush with the charlatans, I insisted that my cassettes had to be either TDK or BASF (whose chrome tapes were superior to the superferric, but were alleged to wear away the tape heads).Judging by the number of Boots C-60s in my collection, I wasn't entirely successful. My parents were baffled by my obsession with blank cassette tapes, but what they failed to see was that each one offered the potential to make the interior world more tangible. If I play one of my old C-90s now, I can hear an aural montage of the things that preoccupied me as a teenager.Quite why I wanted to record the switchover of Radio Four from medium to long wave is beyond me. I also wonder why I taped the theme tune of David Bellamy's Australian wildlife series 'Up a Gum Tree'. But the beauty of these recordings is that they manage to evoke the past far more potently than any photograph.In a recording of a BBC programme - made by placing a microphone in front of a television - my parents' telephone rings, our dog barks and somebody rings the doorbell. I remember being infuriated, but today, it is these extraneous noises that make the recording so evocative.When I searched through my drawer of cassettes, I found comedy tapes that I'd recorded with friends, attempts at 'radiophonic' sound effects, embarrassing teenage conversations about the meaning of life and some music I'd written for fringe plays. I couldn't throw them away.After deciding that I had to keep my tapes, I realised that I had nothing to play them on. £20 later, a new Walkman arrived in the post and I started sorting through my tape collection. Revisiting the past is always a bittersweet experience, but these days I feel kinder towards my adolescent self.At one point, when I heard an impression of Pope John Paul II that I'd spent weeks perfecting, I even laughed."},
{"title": "Filming the Unfilmable", "date": "Sunday, May 19, 2013", "text": "I wonder what the author David Mitchell would have thought if, nine years ago, someone had told him that 'Cloud Atlas' would be turned into a commercial movie starring Tom Hanks, Hugh Grant and Halle Berry, directed by the people who made 'The Matrix Reloaded'.I know what I would have thought.But I watched the film and for all its flaws, it was a triumph. I managed to forget that Tom Hanks was Tom Hanks. Hugh Grant, freed from the tyranny of having to play caricatures of himself, showed that he could really act. As for Halle Berry, she was magnificent.I'd always assumed that Cloud Atlas was unfilmable, but apparently I was wrong:My one bugbear was with the narrative structure, which chopped David Mitchell's six stories up into a mosaic of brief scenes that randomly jumped from the middle of the 19th century to the distant future. At first it was exhilarating, then it began to grate. In an ideal world, the DVD will contain an alternative version that re-edits the footage in a way that's more faithful to the novel.But I'm still bowled-over by the spectacle of seeing the realisation of a book I'd regarded as being completely impossible to film. It probably helped that the cast also included Jim Broadbent, Ben Wishaw, Hugo Weaving and James D'Arcy. But in spite of that, it could have still been exercrably awful.Now that my prejudices have been cast aside, I'm looking forward to Tom Hanks in Ulysses, complete with dodgy Oirish accent."},

All of the following illustrations have been discovered during the last few days. I've always had a soft spot for 1970s fashions, particularly the neo-Victorian style of Jon Pertwee's Doctor Who and Peter Wyngarde's Jason King. However, these migraine-inducing designs from Sewing Illustrated show a very different sartorial zeitgeist: The woman looks a little uncomfortable, and it's not just because the man's hand is dangerously close to her left breast. She knows that she looks utterly ridiculous. \"A colour-co-ordinated lawn rake? Thanks Dad!\" Designs like these are enough to make anyone yearn for the age of clothing coupons and post-war austerity. These pictures, from two decades earlier, show a very different world: \"I say. Awfully well done Mr Fuller. Your merrows have surpahhhssed themselves this year...\"\"Ebsolutely splindid! Congretulations!\"Did these people fight for a world of patchwork denim and yellow garden rakes? No. But somehow this period was the midwife to the age of Garry Glitter, Jimmy Savile and the Bay City Rollers. A decade earlier, the stakes were even higher than gardening competitions:It all has me longing for a quieter, more innocent age, before people said \"Yay!\" and \"LOL\". A time when gentlemen of commerce would have to sit in silence during train journeys. Perhaps the 1880s: This 1886 Boy's Own illustration looks as if it's recording the very first use of a smartphone, but actually the young man is looking at a portrait of his recently-deceased sister. In my desire to escape to the past, I'd forgotten about consumption, rickets and polio. I wouldn't have made it to adulthood.Finally, my favourite cover this week.

The mother is now back in the nest.I apologise if this blog has veered off on an animal-related tangent recently, but so has my life. I never expected to end up selling books surrounded by cows, horses, sheep, pheasants, dogs, robins, rats and a mink (sadly now deceased). Sometimes, I secretly yearn for the days when I lived in a flat in London.But even my lovely 1930s flat in Twickenham didn't completely protect me from the brutal forces of nature. Copulating foxes regularly kept us awake. They also prompted me to run half-naked into the street, thinking that I was rescuing a woman from being attacked (thankfully nobody caught me standing in the middle of the road in my boxer shorts).One day our hot water stopped working. We phoned a plumber called Trevor, who took our boiler apart and found a bird's nest inside. Trevor, who was never usually lost for words, shook his head and chuckled. Later, Trevor casually remarked that he was surprised that we hadn't suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning, as the nest had blocked up the flue.Next time I find a large deposit of bird excrement on the computer, I will have to remind myself that there is no escape. Even in London, the animals are secretly watching and waiting."},
{"title": "Kitten Strachey", "date": "Monday, May 06, 2013", "text": "I solemnly swear that I will not make a habit of posting pictures of my new kitten in 'amusing' poses, but please indulge me for a moment. After years of thinking many unkind things about cats and their owners, I have become completely won over by the feline world. Perhaps it's true that there's nothing worse than a convert.I just didn't 'get' cats before. They came across as unaffectionate ingrates, capable of sudden acts of unwarranted viciousness, leading a sordid double-life of violence, sexual promiscuity and defecation in the gardens and alleys of Britain.I thought that the owners were even worse, particularly those funny little women who used to buy the 'Cats Are Better Than Men' book from me. Did they really prefer to to form a relationship with a mute animal rather than a real person? When a friend told me that her cat had been diagnosed with diabetes and would now need a daily injection, I couldn't see what all the fuss was about. Why didn't she just have it put down?But now, at last, I understand. Perhaps cats are better than men, after all.I'll get my coat.I'm not sure how much the kitten is helping my oldest son, but my wife and I are definitely benefiting from his presence. We almost fight over the opportunity to lie on the sofa and let the cat fall asleep on us. It's like taking valium, minus the slightly depressing sense of detachment from reality.As much as I love dogs, I can do without the early morning walks - there's nothing good about having to pick up excrement in the rain on a cold winter morning. I'm also glad that our house won't have that cloying dog smell of overcooked peas. But most of all, I'm relieved to be free from the awful feeling of guilt that dogs inspire, with their big, reproachful eyes. If you have a difficult child, a dog might seem like a solution, but there is a danger that it will simply add to the stresses of family life.Someone recently told me that a friend of hers  - a very thoughtful, considerate man - bought a small tree as a birthday present for his wife. She was having a very difficult time with her children and as she loved trees, it seemed like the perfect present. However, when the plant was unveiled, she broke down and wept: \"Oh God, not another fucking thing to worry about!\"The only person that remains immune to our kitten's feline charms is our seven-year-old son, who may be having a fit of pique about being usurped as the youngest and cutest. When asked how he felt, he replied that he was \"like Switzerland in the War. Neutral.\"The kitten remains unnamed, but the top photo has given us an idea. Not Lytton Strachey, but perhaps 'Kitten Strachey'? Strachey (which sounds a little like 'Stretchy') for short?It's growing on me.P.S. - Sadly, Kitten Strachey died in early July - a victim of Feline Infectious Peritonitis."},
{"title": "Beaches, Bars, Books and Birds", "date": "Sunday, April 28, 2013", "text": "It's been a beautiful morning and even my son's declaration that he loves Coldplay hasn't dented my good mood. We have just returned from the beach, which was eerily deserted: What's the matter with people? After one of the longest, most soul-destroying winters in living memory, I would have expected everyone within a 10-mile radius to flock to the beach on a day like this. Perhaps, unlike me, they knew that the tide was coming in.The empty calm of Birling Gap made a marked contrast to the place I was at 12 hours earlier:This looks like a set from the 1960s German sci-fi television series Raumpatrouille Orion, but is actually a chichi cocktail bar in Brighton where 'happening' people go. Because most of my happening has already happened, I felt a little incongruous. However, as I'd gone for the Russian oligarch look that evening, I blended in quite well with the other middle-aged men, most of whom had kindly taken their nieces out for a drink.My wife and I had arranged to meet a couple for dinner . We barely knew the woman and had never met the husband, so it felt a little like a blind date. Fortunately, they turned out to be lovely people and although the conversation was dominated by comparing notes about our sons' conditions, we found many other things to talk about.The husband is a screenwriter and complained about the number of manuscripts he received from would-be writers: \"If I tell them to bugger off because I'm too busy, they're fine. But if I actually read the thing and criticise it, they can't stand it!\" It rang horribly true. I thought of the many self-published novels that I'd been given over the years. On one occasion, a man handed me three, as if I had nothing better to do in my spare time. I slammed my beer down on the table: \"If I become a millionaire, I'm going to establish a bursary and pay people to not write books.\" That was the drink talking. In the cold light of day, the self-publishing scene is far more complex now that we have e-books. Several publishing sensations began as rejected manuscripts that went on to become Kindle bestsellers. Others, like Hugh Howey's Wool series, were released straight into Kindle format, without any attempt to submit the manuscript to a publisher. Wool is now a bestselling book, with a 20th Century Fox adaptation in the pipeline.Of course, these books are the exceptions to the rule and as a reader, I'd still rather have my choice of new novels curated by publishers, booksellers and literary agents. When I look at Amazon's Kindle books pages, I feel overwhelmed and frustrated by the number of self-published titles. How do I know if they're any good? Can I trust the reviews? On the other hand, if I ever find that there is a book inside me but nobody wants to publish it, it's comforting to know that it's possible to send it out into the world without destroying any trees or wasting a four-figure sum of money. In the meantime, I'm trying to make a living by selling books. Sometimes it feels as events are conspiring to drive me out of business and during the last few months, I've had to contend with a leaking roof, an alcoholic Polish forklift truck driver, an infestation of rodents, the bankruptcy of my postal company and a rates bill that is far higher than expected. As if that isn't enough, I've now discovered that a robin has made a home in the bookshelves:I wouldn't recommend ordering the book on the right. I suppose if the eggs hatch, there'll be more robins, more nests and more droppings on the computers. I didn't envisage any of this."},
{"title": "A Gath Fach Cymraeg, or Back to the Valleys", "date": "Monday, April 22, 2013", "text": "In spite of a private education and a good degree, my wife is lamentably ignorant about anything to do with geography. It's not that she lacks the aptitude; she simply has no interest in where places are in relation to each other and finds my love of maps and atlases completely baffling.Two weeks ago my wife announced that she'd agreed to buy a kitten from someone and asked when I would be free to drive her and our sons to collect it. I gave her a date and asked for the address, imagining somewhere within a 30-mile radius of Lewes. My wife checked her emails: \"She says she lives near Oswestry. Is that far?\" I took a deep breath. \"Well, it's not terribly near.\"On a list of things I thought I'd never do, owning a cat is in the top ten, along with line dancing, bungee jumping and joining the Territorial Army. However, I have just driven 525 miles in 24 hours to transport a kitten from a beautiful rural farmhouse in Wales to our glorified broom cupboard in Lewes.Was it worth it? I'm not a cat person, but this little chap has completely won me over:He doesn't have a name yet. I wanted to give him an inappropriate human name, like David, but I have been overruled.The journey was mind-numbingly tedious: a sequence of Ms and As with various numbers attached, interspersed with service stations that appeared to be patronised solely by people who had recently been released from prison. Where were the middle classes? There's a gap in the market - I'm sure a service station that incorporated a contemporary art gallery and a sushi restaurant would be a huge success. I'd go there.At every stop I couldn't wait to get back in the car and although the M40 wasn't the most exciting stretch of road I've driven along, the boredom was relieved by a wonderfully funny edition of Desert Island Discs with Miriam Margolyes (which you can find here). It was almost as funny as her unlikely encounter with will.i.am.The outskirts of Birmingham were particularly depressing - the highlight was the largest electricity substation I've ever seen. But things began to improve once we reached Shropshire and the distant hills made me think of A. E. Housman's 1896 cycle of poems and their disarmingly prophetic sentiments:East and west on fields forgottenBleach the bones of comrades slain,Lovely lads and dead and rotten;None that go return again.On a map, the English countryside appears to seamlessly segue into the Welsh landscape and the border seems quite arbitary, but in reality the change is far more dramatic. Gently rolling hills become steep valleys, while pastel hues change to darks greens, slate greys and burnt umber. This is where the Saxon invaders abruptly stopped, unwilling to farm on the increasingly sharp gradients beyond the Welsh Marches. We had decided to break up the journey by staying overnight in Llangollen - a place I knew absolutely nothing about, except for its association with a famous Victorian lesbian couple. I was delighted to discover a small market town with an 13th century bridge that spanned the roaring torrents of the River Dee.It was good to be back in Wales after so many years and I enjoyed seeing the once familiar words that I had struggled to master when I was at university there: llfrygell (library), swyddfa (office) and cigydd (butcher).I had chosen to study Welsh in my first year, as it seemed liked the right thing to do. Sadly, I was  spectacularly bad at it and became a figure of notoriety amongst the lecturers in the Welsh department (apparently they used to talk about me long after I had left). However, I can at least pronounce the words and still remember that a w is an oo, an f is a v, a u is an ee and a ll is a hl, not a cl. My sons seemed quite bemused to learn that they were no longer in England and started asking when we were going home. Later, after a long silence, my seven-year-old suddenly said: \"They're so proud of their country. Welsh butter, Welsh cheese, Welsh lamb. They'll be saying it's Welsh air next!\"Where did this world-weary cynicism come from? \"Don't you find it exciting being somewhere new?\" I asked. Both boys shook their heads. I was a little depressed by my sons' lamentable lack of interest in Llangollen and decided to go for a proper walk in the evening, unhindered by whining voices and dragging feet.I began by exploring the back streets of the town. I had forgotten how many pubs and churches there were in Welsh towns, with a wide choice of venues for both sin and redemption. The capels were as granite grey and bleak as an RS Thomas poem. Over the bridge, a heritage steam railway offered a 30-minute ride through the Dee Valley. If I'd been here longer, I would have happily made the journey: \"Single to somewhere unpronounceable please.\"Beyond the station, in the far distance, a solitary house overlooked the town:The lone house reminded me of the sense of isolation I often felt as an English student in Welsh-speaking Wales, where there often wasn't much of a welcome in the hillsides. Some of the local people were friendly, but most regarded us with an attitude that ranged from begrudging tolerance to outright hostility. I can't say I blamed them.I crossed the road and began to climb a hill, leaving the town behind me. On the way, I crossed the Llangollen Canal, which is at least 50 feet above the unnavigable river below:Further up, the towns ends with some fairly hideous 1980s council offices, which look as if they have been constructed out of Lego. These incongruous buildings make it is easy to be distracted and miss the small sign that points the way to the ruined Castell Dinas Bran:The castle is thought to have been built by Gruffydd II ap Madog in the 1260s and has been a ruin for almost as long as it has existed. Sadly it was too late for me to walk to the remain of Dinas Bran (it was much further than this zoomed-in photo suggests), but the picture below makes me want to come back:I managed to get about a third of the way there and was rewarded with these views:In the distance I could hear the sound of a church bell, the whistle of a steam engine, the distant roar of the river and the bleating of lambs. It seemed almost impossible idyllic, but then I saw this:It made a stark contrast to the window display in the taxidermy shop at the bottom of the hill, where two women ahead of me were struggling to walk in tight leather mini skirts and high heels. One had a long mane of peroxided blonde hair, the other's was jet black. They appeared to be in their early 30s, but as I caught up with them, the women aged a year with each yard until they reached their mid-50s.I'd forgotten the buzz of a Saturday night in a small town. Further along the road, their granddaughters were huddled around the till-point of the local Spar, squeezed into revealing dresses that looked at least two sizes too small. All of the girls were made-up very heavily, with the longest false eyelashes I had ever seen. Perhaps they were trying to get picked-up via Google Earth. The local boys certainly seemed nonplussed. After a less than perfect night's sleep in a local hostel, we made a terrifying 10-mile journey to the kitten's owners, driving along tiny lanes with sheer drops to the side that plunged hundreds of feet. By the time we reached here, it felt as if we were on a motorway:Our kitten was one of 20 cats that inhabited a remote farmhouse. The owners, who had moved there from Kent eight years ago, were lovely people who had seen the area they grew up in ruined by over-development and wanted to find a home where they could enjoy dark skies and be free from the distant roar of traffic. I asked them how they had integrated into the community. They replied that it was remarkbly easy, as 80% of their neighbours were also incomers.The issue of migration is problematic. Once, we used to grow up in an area and call it home. Aunties, uncles, cousins and grandparents usually lived within walking distance, but after the 1950s, we all became more mobile, both geographically and socially. Fewer people rented and property prices became more polarised.My hometown of Teddington used to be an unremarkable, lower middle/upper working class suburb, but in the 1980s it suddenly became very desirable and houses like my parents' Victorian semi shot from £3,800 in 1963 to £550,000 in 2003.My wife and I couldn't afford to buy a house in the local area, so we sold our Twickenham flat and traded it in for a small (but perfectly formed) 1890s terraced property in Lewes. I'm very glad that we did, but I'm now also conscious that by doing this, we helped to increase the house prices in Lewes, making it harder for local people to get on the property ladder.I don't feel comfortable about that, but I'm not sure what the answer is. All I can say is that I've made a long-term committment to the area and don't regard my home as an investment.But I digress. To return to the main theme of this long, rambling post, we collected the kitten and began the long drive back to Lewes. It 'yowled' in protest all the way, but some times more than others. It became calmer when I played Beethoven, but when a guest on Desert Island Discs chose a Bob Dylan song, the yowling suddenly increased.I can only conclude that this cat obviously has an impeccable taste in music. We arrived home in the evening. Our nameless kitten shot out of his basket and hid in the shoe rack for two hours, but by nine o'clock he was shamelessly climbing over me, rubbing his face against mine and proffering his bottom.We had bonded.I'd always thought of myself as someone who loved dogs and hated cats, but it looks as if I've been wrong all these years.Better late than never."},

I had hoped to find a more amusing image, but they're nearly all in landscape format, which doesn't lend itself to the Ladybird treatment. Also, my software is 12-years-old (a bad workman always blames his tools).I wonder what a Ladybird book of Margaret Thatcher would say? I'm sure that it would be a voice of reason, avoiding the hysterical rhetoric of her admirers and enemies. Perhaps something along the lines of Polly Toynbee's succinct summing-up of the Thatcher era:\"She undoubtedly rescued the prestige of the country from its postwar nadir, but at a high cost to the generosity of its political and social culture.\" One other piece of common sense about Margaret Thatcher can be found here. Sadly, most of the  responses to yesterday's news are drivel, from Geri Halliwell's tweet about 'Girl power' to the US news item that claimed that Mrs Thatcher had rescued her people from \"30 years of socialism.\"I have very clear memories of the first and third terms of the Thatcher government, but during the second I lived in rural Wales, which was stuck in the year 1978. When I returned to London, I felt as if I had travelled 20 years into the future. What had happened while I'd been away? Why was it no longer possible to buy a white coffee without going through a list of 20 options?Rather than add to the many words that have been written during the last 36 hours, here are some random images that I associate with the Thatcher era:         But amongst the various tributes to Mrs Thatcher's achievements, for good or ill, few have acknowledged the important role that she played in developing Mr Whippy ice cream during her days as an industrial chemist. I hope that the next time you enjoy a soft ice cream - possibly a 99 if you're feeling a little dangerous - think of Mrs Thatcher in her white coat, striving to find a technique of adding air and reducing the milk content. It's almost a metaphor for her later career, but not quite.NB - I have been informed that Mrs Thatcher worked for Mr Softee, not Mr Whippy. My apologies to all fans of Lyons Maid for this error."},
{"title": "The Ladybird Book of the Recession - Part Two", "date": "Saturday, March 30, 2013", "text": "This is a town, like many other towns. Perhaps you live somewhere like this. In this town, many people work in the local shops and factories. Some travel further, by rail or road, to a job in another town. The shops are very important to the town. When somebody buys bread at the bakery, the baker can use some of that money to buy meat from the local butcher. The butcher may then spend some of this money to have his car serviced at the nearby garage. This system of people passing money around is called a 'local economy'. Some experts think that if you spend a shilling, it will be worth ten shillings to the town, because it will have been handed around so many times.This lady is not helping the local economy. She is buying her food from a supermaket that sends most of its money to another town, many miles away. But the supermarket is cheap and the lady is worried that she cannot afford to buy her food in the local shops.The lady is not the only person in the town worrying about money. When a lot of people start to worry about money at the same time and begin buying fewer things, this is called a 'recession'. A recession affects most people in the town. The fishmonger says that fewer people are buying fresh fish from his shop this year. Because of this, he will have to get rid of his assistant and may even close the shop. He is very worried.Some governments will try to stop people worrying by spending more money, to protect jobs and help businesses. If fewer jobs are lost, more people will spend money in the shops. But this town has a government that is trying to mend the recession by spending less. Because the Government is giving less money to people, many shops and businesses in the town are beginning to close. Some people are losing their jobs. At this local factory, a man called Robert has been told that he is going to lose his job as a sales manager. He will also have to hand back his 'company car', which was given to him by the factory. Robert is very worried about how this will affect his family.Robert and his family live in a nice new housing estate, but it is a long way from the centre of town. They will now have to catch a bus to go the shops. The buses are expensive and some of the passengers smell.Robert likes drinking wine. Since he lost his job, Robert has been drinking more wine. His wife is worried that they cannot afford it, but Robert says that the wine cheers him up.Wine can make people forgetful. Robert has forgotten to pay for his bottle of wine. As he leaves the shop, a policeman arrives. The policeman was called by the shopkeeper, who was worried that Robert has stolen the wine.In a recession, when people cannot afford to buy the things they want, some of them steal. If they are caught, they may go to prison.This lady may not look like a thief, but she has stolen an expensive handbag. She is trying to pretend that the handbag is hers. The other woman is getting cross.The lady wanted the handbag because she had seen a lot of advertisements for it. When people who have no money keep being told to buy things they cannot afford, they can become sad or angry.Some young people became so angry that they robbed this department store and set fire to it. The store will probably not open again and a lot of shopworkers will lose their jobs. Most people are afraid of losing their job. However, the Government is worried that a lot of people would prefer to stay at home and watch television instead of working and paying taxes, so they are changing the law.These men will not be able to watch television all day, as they now live outdoors. They used to live in houses that belonged to the town, but they were told that these homes were too big for them. The Government would like these men to live in smaller homes and get a job.  But they will have trouble finding work, as they cannot look smart for a job interview.Nobody knows when the recession will end. Robert and his wife have decided to have a fresh start in Australia, where Robert will work at his brother-in-law's carpet cleaning business. Robert is not very interested in carpet cleaning.They will all miss their family and friends. The town was their home, but they know that even if the recession ends, the old shops will not reopen and life will never quite be the same again."},
{"title": "Abandonment", "date": "Saturday, March 23, 2013", "text": "The highlights of last week were an exploding laptop, a leaking sink, a dead mink (the rats will inherit the earth), a new crisis with my older son and the discovery that I have a lung infection. As none of these things make a particularly edifying blog post, I'm posting some photos I took of some abandoned buildings in Iceland.If that seems a bit 'random' - as the kids like to say - I should add that I've just been reading Andrew Moore's superb 'Detroit Disassembled' and have been thinking about why ruined buildings are often so more interesting than well-maintained ones.These crudely-built structures, with their rusted, corrugated iron roofs, were once a hive of activity for Iceland's fishing industry. Why they were abandoned is a mystery.  It looked as if the buildings had been abandoned in a hurry. Sou'westers were strewn across the floor of one room, while another had mattresses propped against the walls. But the thing that unnerved me most was a small entrance to a dark, unlit basement, which I nearly fell into. After adjusting my eyes to the gloom, I could see a chair and lengths of rope, as if someone had been held captive here.It was like being in a Mike Nelson installation, but without the irritation of being constantly distracted by other people. Here, your imagination - and paranoia - could run wild. I've no doubt that everything there was related to the fishing industry, but the murky basement and discarded syringes were a little unsettling.It is shocking how quickly buildings fall into decay. As the roofs of these structures rust, the late rains will seep into the walls, freeze and create fissures until, eventually, the inside is hard to distinguish from the outside.Every ruin is a reminder that even the most solid-looking building is in a state of flux. We struggle to maintain the illusion of permanence, but the moment we abandon the fight, we find ourselves in Detroit.We wonder,—and some Hunter may express    Wonder like ours, when thro' the wilderness      Where London stood, holding the Wolf in chace,    He meets some fragment huge, and stops to guess      What powerful but unrecorded race      Once dwelt in that annihilated place."},

{"title": "That Touch of Mink", "date": "Saturday, March 16, 2013", "text": "I thought last week was bad, but this one has been far worse, with one email after another from customers asking where their books are. It has made me realise that however hard you work, if you sell on the internet you can be completely buggered by the postal network. I could tell from the emails that some people were very angry. As one person wrote, \"How hard is it to put a book in an envelope and post it?\" Fortunately, Mark Twain's advice - \"When in doubt, tell the truth\" - has paid off. Almost every customer has been extremely patient and sympathetic, once they've realised what I've been up against.In addition to writing apologetic emails to people, I also had to take a van up to Berkshire to collect some stock. It's usually a straightforward journey, but this time my SatNav had a psychotic episode and took me on a terrifying drive along some narrow, snow-bound country lanes. I think it's trying to kill me.To make things worse, someone had changed the settings so that every traffic direction was given in a Dalek voice. The amusement value of hearing \"IN 300 YARDS, TURN LEFT...HUMAN\" quickly wore very thin.Fortunately, I had some CDs of Radio Four podcasts to relieve the tedium of driving along a motorway being shouted at by a Dalek, including a fascinating Desert Island Discs with Jill Balcon - now better known as the mother of Daniel Day Lewis. She was nearly 80 when the programme was recorded, but had the voice and attitude of someone in their 50s, speaking with a great passion and self-effacing humour about her extraordinary life. What a woman.In truth it was nice to get away from the farm. I have worked in a few unusual places, but never anywhere where it snows indoors. I suppose there must be a hole in the roof, but I can't see where.Sometimes a robin enters the barn  and sings sweetly. Then it ruins everything by defecating on the books and computers. How many people have to wipe bird droppings off their PC monitor and keyboard  before they can start work?The week reached a grand finale yesterday, with a fight between a mink and a rat. The mink seemed to have the upper hand, even though it was barely larger than the rat. Then we made the mistake of getting too close and for a second, the mink lost its grip. The rat quickly ran underneath a table and found a small hole near a pile of boxes. Undeterred, the mink strutted around the barn as if it owned the place, oblivious to the presence of four humans. Eventually it got bored and decided to lie in wait under some wheelie bins.It was all very odd. At the time, we had no idea that we were looking at a mink, but Google images quickly identified the strange, dark, ferret-like creature: Next week I will be dealing with a rat infestation, writing some more apologies and getting to grips with a complicated new postal system. At some point I may even have time to look at some books, like this one: But I wouldn't bank on it."},
{"title": "Condensed Milk, Electricty Substations and Bunty", "date": "Tuesday, March 12, 2013", "text": "Today began with an ominous silence, as a light dusting of snow had bought Lewes to a standstill. I'd been planning to take a van up to Berkshire, but the BBC News website showed footage of abandoned lorries in snowdrifts, with people saying that they were \"disgusted\" that this freak weather hadn't been anticipated.Later, the snow had thawed enough for me to drive to work and deal with the orders. When I arrived, the cows looked at me imploringly and mooed in unison. It's becoming quite oppressive. I don't know what they think I can do.Many people would regard the process of picking and packing the book orders as quite tedious, but I find it endlessly fascinating because of the surprises it brings. When I put the books on sale, I often have a certain idea of the type of people who might buy them, but half of the time I'm completely wrong.For example, the 1970 Bunty annual that I expected to sell to a woman in her 50s is ordered by a man called Mohammed Al-Ahmed, whilst the pulp Wild West novel that I thought would be bought by a man called Len in his 60s, ends up being posted to a woman in Slovenia. I given up trying to guess who will buy the books (and can anyone tell me why nearly seventy percent of my Biggles sales are to Australians?).If high street bookselling often gave me a disappointing glimpse of humanity, this is the antidote. It is hard not to feel an affection for these strangers, with their secret passions and ecclectic, eccentric interests. When I pack the books I wrap them carefully, as if they were presents for a friend.One important lesson I've learned is that no book is too dull to put on sale. Why anyone would want a 1929 book about the industrial processes behind the manufacture of condensed milk is beyond me. I also find it hard to see the appeal of a 1957 book on electricty substations. Surely, it's horribly out of date, unless there's an electricity substation nostalgia market. But both titles were snapped up.However, there's just one book I just can't shift, even though I've reduced the price several times:The front cover's a little spartan, but he looks like a friendly chap. Any takers?"},
{"title": "Post Mortem", "date": "Thursday, March 07, 2013", "text": "This hasn't been the best of weeks. The postal company that handles my book orders appears to have gone bankrupt. I didn't get any warning. One day they simply stopped coming. I have also discovered that for the last three weeks, they collected my post and kept it in a corner of a warehouse.I am now dealing with a growing number of emails that range from the politely titled 'Delivery enquiry' to the rather more direct 'Where's my bloody book?!' Luckily, my business is small enough for me to respond to each email personally and most people have been very sympathetic. However, I doubt whether I'll survive this without getting some negative feedback on Amazon.Perhaps the worst aspect of this whole business has been having to take all of the orders to the local post office. The UK ones are easy enough, but trying to send 15 packages to the USA is the nearest I've come to be being beaten to death by an angry mob. I've walked through the notorious Tenderloin district of San Francsico at night and felt uncomfortable, but I've never known fear like the Lewes Post Office queue. I can't go back.For some relaxation, I watched 'Gideon of Scotland Yard' with my mother. Filmed in 1958 and starring Jack Hawkins, it is a relentlessly frank expose of how brutal the British police were in the 1950s:No wonder the crime rate was so low. I also enjoyed this scene, in which Jack Hawkins manages to juggle two telephones and light a pipe at the same time. But watch the buses in the background - they look suspiciously like models to me:Superficially, 'Gideon of Scotland Yard' is a standard 1950s police procedural film, but unusually it is filmed in Technicolor and directed by John Ford, who rated Jack Hawkins as \"the finest dramatic actor with whom I have worked.\" 55 years on, the film seems very dated, but in a good way. I particularly loved the street scenes and a garish, 'thoroughly modern' 1950s flat.Without fail, my mother always turns to me and says \"D'you know these old films are good aren't they? There's no swearing or anything.\" By anything, I presume that she means sex.My mother often asks me how I find these films, blissfully unaware that I spend ages scouring a website for obscure British 'B movies' made between 1940 and 1960. I know her better than she'll ever know me, so choosing the films is easy. Also, I've found that as long as the star is called Jack - either Hawkins or Warner - she'll be happy.An email box has just popped up in the corner of the screen: \"Non-delivery of By a Silver Stream\".It's going to be a long week."},
{"title": "Tempus Fugit", "date": "Sunday, March 03, 2013", "text": "Another year nearer the nameless terrors of the grave, to quote a friend's card. My mother has spent the whole week in a state because she can't find a birthday card in Lewes that says 'Son' on the front. My wife has tried to convince her that I'm not bothered, whilst reassuring her that I nevertheless loved all of the cards that did say 'son'. My mother buys me the cards that she thinks are 'nice'. They always have some sort of pastel image on the front and 'Son' in gold lettering, with a cloyingly sentimental verse inside. I usually end up feeling slightly depressed by the fact that if she really knew me, my mother wouldn't give me these cards. But I'm also touched by the fact the fact that the words really mean something to her.One year, I decided to give my mother a card that I thought was beautiful and spent a long time choosing it. The following week, my father took me to one side and told me that she was very upset to receive a card that said 'Mother' instead of 'Mum' and had no verse inside. I learned my lesson and now look for the soppiest birthday card I can find. Sometimes I delegate the task to my wife.Every year, my mother tells me how much she loved the card, particularly the \"wonderful verse\". I hope that when my sons are older, I will be interested in them enough to send a card that shows some insight into the adults they have become. My mother is lovely in so many ways and I'm lucky to still have her, but her lack of interest in my life can be breathtaking. I once rang her from Death Valley and explained that the temperature was 110f. She replied \"Well, there's been a heatwave in Worthing.\"When asked what I wanted for my birthday, I told my wife that I really didn't mind as long as it was a CD of music by someone whose first name was Franz and surname began with Sch. But nothing by Schubert, please. Undeterred, she managed to find these:For a joke, I told someone that I was working through the classical repertoire alphabetically and was now on Sch. The look on their face told me that I had picked the wrong person. In some corner of Lewes, I will now be known as the man who hasn't listened to Tchaikovsky yet.Both CDs contain some of the best music I've heard for a long time and the beginning of Franz Schmidt's Symphony No.2 is one of the most beautiful, life-enhancing openings you could wish for: Franz Schmidt didn't have the happiest of lives: a feud with a rather vindictive Mahler, a wife who went insane and a daughter who died in childbirth all contributed to his growing alcoholism. But his music betrays little of this and I particularly like what one critic described as its 'fulgent' orchestration. Fellow Austrian Franz Schreker's life also ended tragically, when his career was bought to a standstill by the Nazis - he was half-Jewish. According to Wikipedia,  \"In his lifetime (Schreker) went from being hailed as the future of German opera to being considered irrelevant as a composer and marginalized as an educator.\" He died in 1934, two days before his 56th birthday.This is how good he was:I have clearly struck gold with the Franz Sch- stipulation. Next week it's Schuman and Schumann."},

Today I found some photos of the walk, taken back in the Age of Kodak. I don't think they're wonderful pictures, but they do serve as a reminder that even in one of the most densely-populated parts of Europe, there are still plenty of empty spaces.A large part of the route follows prehistoric tracks and if I wanted to give a truly accurate impression of the journey, I'd probably post a succession of photos showing paths going up and down hills. But it's what you see on the way that makes the journey worth making: a Saxon church, a stately home, a slow worm, a disused railway line, a memorial to a Luftwaffe pilot whose plane crashed nearby, a field of poppies, a Roman road, a dragonfly hunting for prey, a dew pond, an Iron Age hill fort, a pair of windmills and a weasel.The South Downs Way begins in a dreary field, just on the outskirts of Winchester. It ends by the sea, in the spectacular setting of Beachy Head - the highest point on the south coast of England.I have resisted the temptation to 'improve' these 35mm film pictures with any Photoshop trickery.

{"title": "The Land of Lost Content", "date": "Thursday, February 21, 2013", "text": "Another day spent consigning worthless books to oblivion. I'm probably destroying more books than Hitler, but at least I'm not burning them. I did try when I bought my woodburning stove, last year, but they make a terrible mess. What a shame - it could have really cut the heating bills.Today I had to throw away a box of annuals, but I kept some of the illustrations so that they could be scanned and float aound in Google Images for posterity.  I used to innocently give the jpegs names like 'schoolgirls01', but discovered that I was attracting the wrong sort of traffic. Here are some of my favourites:\"I say, hurrah for Blenkinsop! He's beaten Carstairs Minor's record!\" Carstairs Minor set the school record in June 1916, shortly before he went off to the trenches. Little do they know that Blenkinsop has been trying a new drug called a 'steroid' that his Uncle Dick bought back from a business trip in America.The wholesome, outdoor theme continues, although the boy in the front appears to be in the grip of a psychotic episode. His companion looks slightly nervous:\"Er, Billy? I'm getting awfully wet back here...\"But not all of the characters were good eggs:That Cad Cardew is playing merry hell with the school notice board. Who knows what chaos will ensue?This is one of several short stories, with titles like:SALTY BLAKE'S TOP-OF-THE-FORM FOOTER FINDJET JAXON - CAPTIVE OF THE LOST LEGIONTHRILLS ON THREE WHEELS!THE MYSTERY OF BAD LUCK ISLANDGINGER NUTT - THE BOY WHO TAKES THE BISCUITBUSTER O'BRIEN AND THE VANISHING POLE-VAULTERI wonder how many boys actually read these short stories? I can't imagine ever making the effort - I always preferred comic strips - but perhaps children were more receptive in the pre-television age.It's either that, or simply that the grown-ups refused to pander to the tastes of their young readers. I suspect the latter, as I can't imagine that a lengthy article on iron smelting would have ever been that interesting to an eleven-year-old boy.On the other hand, I can imagine being captivated by pictures like these:This illustration of the night-mail arriving from some far-flung corner of the globe evokes an exciting world of romance and adventure - a stark contrast to the average boy's drab existence of school, church on Sundays and visiting relations. The illusion is slightly shattered by the fact that the plane's arriving at Croydon aerodrome, but never mind.(On a serious note, this picture reminds me of one of my favourite books, which I'd strongly recommend to anyone who hasn't read it: Wind, Sand and Stars, by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry) Other illustrations also depict exotic locations, populated by hostile natives and enemy agents: But perhaps the ultimate schoolboy hero was the fighter pilot: A few years ago, I met an old man who did exactly this - he even had the photos to prove it. He said that firing the bombs was relatively easy, but taking decent pictures of the explosions was a nightmare. I also found some girls annuals, which weren't quite as exciting as these ones that I found a couple of months ago . This girl doesn't look as if she'd be terribly keen on a game of lacrosse: As for these young flappers, they seem to be having a rather wild party:Thank goodness the object's a fake beard. The game could have been very embarrassing for 'Uncle' George, who is looking nervously on in the background.The next picture neatly sums up everything that has gone wrong with British society since the Lady Chatterley trial:See what I mean? In those days even the burglars wore ties. People had standards.By 1968, when the next annual was published, it was all going to pot - metaphorically and literally. The only girls left in the Guides movement were those who hadn't succumbed to the allure of youth culture. Here they are in a field, somewhere in England on an overcast day, studying for their cooking and washing-up badges:The girl in the centre - I'll call her Ginny - seems to be enjoying herself, but the other two girls look as if they'd rather be listening to the Rolling Stones, with some boys. Luckily, Ginny doesn't seem to have noticed:Those white socks seem a little impractical for a muddy field, but I suppose they make the girls easier to spot in the dark. Looking at these annuals, I feel both a sense of nostalgia for what seems like a more innocent age and, mostly, a huge relief that I don't have to live in it."},
{"title": "Ghosts", "date": "Sunday, February 17, 2013", "text": "This morning I felt as if I was in an M.R. James story: alone on a misty country lane, listening to the sound of horses hooves that seemed to approach, but never arrived. I don't believe in ghosts, but fog has a curious ability to induce feelings of paranoia. When the visible world is reduced to a radius of 20 yards, the sounds that come from beyond its limits can seem vaguely threatening.I don't think that working on my own suits me. I'd always thought it would, but I spent this morning alone in my cowshed, picking the book orders for tomorrow's collection and found myself going over past injustices, broken friendships and unresolved conflicts. I've no idea why.David Sylvian wrote a very good song about it.Yesterday was more my cup of tea, with a return visit to the wonderful Light Show at the Hayward Gallery:I was there two weeks ago and was so impressed, I decided to buy tickets for my wife and youngest son. Taking a seven-year-old to an art gallery is always a gamble, but I thought that the Light Show would be a safe bet and I was right. My son loved it. We should have quit while we were ahead, but my wife had heard that there was a free performance of Poulenc's Story of Babar the Elephant, next door, in the Royal Festival Hall:Poulenc's sub-Stravinskian score lacks the big tunes that make Peter and the Wolf so successful, but the players and two narrators performed with gusto. Sadly, they were no competition for several hundred under-fives with a short attention span and we struggled to hear the music above the din of screaming children and mothers shouting \"Lily! Please stop hitting the man.\"As I was the man that Lily was hitting, I was quite keen to leave.We walked back to Waterloo Station via the South Bank. Even in February, the area was packed with street entertainers and the queue for the London Eye seemed longer than ever. In an archway, a man was lying on the ground singing \"I...woz...bawwnnnnn...in... Lahhhhhdan...tahhhhhn...\" and I realised that his was the first genuine London accent I'd heard all day. It would be rather poignant if the only real Londoner I saw was a homeless man.The journey home took longer than usual, as someone had decided to throw themselves on the railway line at Shoreham. Instead of the usual euphemistic descriptions of a 'passenger action' or 'incident', we were baldly told that someone had \"committed suicide at Shoreham\". My son looked horrified. On the way home, both my wife and I agreed that being in London was invigorating. We had got into a rut since our oldest son became ill, last year, avoiding any journeys outside Lewes because our absence exacerbated his anxiety.It had seemed liked the right thing at the time. However, when I found myself working in a remote cowshed, surrounding by hostile dogs and limbless humans, I knew that I'd only stay sane if I had a little more fun at the weekends.When the landscape looks like this and the first thing I see on leaving work is a sheep's carcass that looks as if it's been stripped by zombies, it's time to buy a ticket to London Victoria. Fortunately, I won't be working alone for much longer. The two postgraduates who worked with me last year will be back next week, so I won't be as susceptible to to the ghosts.I'll end as I began, with M.R. James. Do you believe in ghosts?"},
{"title": "Far From the Madding Crowd", "date": "Thursday, February 07, 2013", "text": "Some years ago I was given the opportunity to open a new bookshop in the Science Museum. I knew very little about science, but managed to bluff my way through it and the shop seemed to do very well. There were a few little niggles, like the time I wasn't allowed in the stock room because the area was being decontaminated for radiation; but on the whole I enjoyed myself.I even liked my commute to South Kensington on the District Line, which was a refreshing change from crawling along the M25 at rush hour. I could tell that my fellow passengers were irritated by the wailing Gypsy beggars who occasionally appeared, or the young South African men who used to leap into the carriage with a guitar and shout \"Hi guys...Today, is gonna be the day when they're gonna give it back to you...\", but I wasn't bothered. It still beat looking at a sign saying QUEUE AT JCT 8.However, there was one aspect of the Science Museum that started to really get to me: the lack of daylight.After spending hours in an air conditioned, windowless hall, I became increasingly disorientated. Was it light or dark outside? What was the weather like? Which season were we in? At first I just found it strange, then I began to sense a creeping depression. What could I do to shake myself out of it?I don't know how the idea came to me, but one day I decided to walk the South Downs Way on my days off. Not all at once - it's 100 miles long - but in 10 to 25-mile sections, depending on where the nearest railway station was. I began in Winchester and, over the course of five months, walked to Eastbourne.It was a wonderful experience in so many ways and, as I walked along the Downs above a town called Lewes, I remember thinking how lucky the locals were to have this countryside on their doorstep. If I lived here, I'd be up on the Downs every weekend.Two years later I was living in Lewes, but was I up on the Downs every weekend? Of course not. Instead I was going up to London, making the most of my Tate Gallery membership, or seeing friends for drinks.However, one of my resolutions for 2013 is to take more long walks, so this afternoon I took a train to Glynde and walked back to Lewes along the Downs. This may not be the most spectacular countryside in the world, but it works in mysterious ways. I didn't meet a single soul for the entire walk and the isolation was liberating:The first part of the walk was awful: a steep climb from Glynde village that made me realise how out of condition I was. At one point I imagined that there was a pain in my chest and I started to think of the various news reports about men of my age - outwardly healthy - who suddenly keel over and die from a heart attack. Who would find me here?But then I reminded myself that the first part of any walk on the South Downs began like this, as the muscles demanded extra oxygen and body took a while to adjust. I wasn't dying. At the top of the Downs, the wind was unforgiving and my cheeks felt scoured by the cold. No wonder it had taken the snow so long to melt on the hills. But it's a continental climate here. In the summer, it can be oppressively hot, with no trees to provide any shade.The physical exertion gradually induced a sense of deep relaxation that was compounded by the silence and isolation. It would probably be trite to say that the journey was mental as well as physical, but the bleakness and emptiness of my surroundings had a profound effect.Eventually, Lewes appeared in the distance, like Bunyan's Celestial City:The path took a turn a made a steep descent. As I walked down, I saw a group of geriatric hikers slowly advancing up the hill and felt both admiration and hope. Someone once suggested that I join a walking group, but I told them that they'd missed the point. It was the isolation that attracted me.However, I suppose there's safety in numbers when you're over a certain age.Entering a world of noise, people and things felt strange. Here were thousands of people, all neatly contained in this space of narrow streets and cramped little houses, while less than a mile away, there was a vast, empty wilderness. I shall be returning to Glynde at the earliest opportunity."},

{"title": "Sound and Vision", "date": "Monday, February 04, 2013", "text": "Although it's only the beginning of February, I think I can safely say that I've just been to my favourite exhibition of 2013.I don't know what other people want from art, but I'm happiest when it brushes away the cobwebs and briefly restores that elusive sense of childlike wonder. That's why I enjoyed the Hayward Gallery's Sound and Light exhibition, which is on until April 28th.The first exhibit is Cyllinder II, by Leo Villareal, which flickers and dazzles with a continually changing pattern. It reminded me of one of those 1960s or 70s sci-fi series where the producers were clearly either pushed for time or had gone over budget: \"I know, why don't we just say that the aliens are so advanced, they've evolved into non-corporeal beings? Then we'll only need a few flashing lights.\"Indeed, there was a very alien quality to this work, as if it had just appeared from nowhere, sent by an higher intelligence as a way of testing our response (which would, of course, be to strip it down and see if the technology could be used for military purposes).Equally spectacular was Chromosaturation, by Carlos Cruz-Diez which, in the artist's own words, is  \"an artificial environment composed of three colour chambers that immerse the visitor in a completeley monochrome situation (where) colour acts with all its force on the spectator's skin, objects and surrounding wall surfaces.\"The result is very disorienting, particularly in the area where the three colours meet and create an effect that feels like a fog:Although the exhibition was packed, this installation was curiously empty. Apart from me, there was just one woman - earnestly studying a pamphlet - and two ageing hipsters: That's what I like about the art world: you can be 49 and still be a 'Young British Artist' - a refreshing contrast to the world of rock and pop, where a pipe and comfy slippers await anyone over 30.Mr Hipster seemed gently bemused by the artwork, but Mrs Hipster said she'd had enough:  I was still trying to get over the shock of seeing my skin in green light. Green's obviously not my colour: As I left Chromosaturation, I saw a long queue and naively assumed that it must be worth joining. 20 minutes of utter tedium followed, only slightly relieved by the unsuccessful attempts of a girl (who looked uncannily like Velma from Scooby Doo) to push in front of me. However, the boredom of queueing was nothing compared to the spectacular dullness of the artwork itself.I looked at my watch. I was due to go to a concert at the Purcell Room in half an hour and needed to get a move on. If only I hadn't wasted 20 minutes with Velma.Luckily I had enough time to see a spectacular installation which consisted of a strobe light and miniature fountains of running water. The effect was breathtaking, creating unique, beautiful sculptures of water that only existed for a mere fragment of a second. Some looked like a row of diamonds, others had the appearance of glass. There was something poignant about the way these beautiful objects were gone before we could begin to savour them. A bit like being young.I rushed through the remaining exhibits, reluctantly missing what looked like a very impressive piece by Iván Navarro, which did something clever with mirrors. I shall have to go back.Outside it was nearly dark. London is not a beautiful city, but I almost like it at twilight:Conveniently, the concert was next door. I'd gone to support a friend who was performing in a choir, but would have happily gone anyway, as the programme contained this beautiful folk song arrangement by Vaughan Williams:I really enjoyed the concert. The music was well-chosen and the standard of singing was exceptional compared to the quivering, geriatric voices of most choral societies. I'd forgotten how beautiful the human voice was.On the journey home I found an empty seat and got out my history of MI6 - I've become slightly obsessed with the SIS during the last couple of months, particularly its activities during the Cold War era. As I started reading the train halted and I absent-mindedly looked out of the window. Spookily, right in front of me was the SIS Building, with its satellite dishes pointing towards the four corners of the globe. I had to change trains at Clapham Junction. I was hungry and looked for something to eat, but although there were plenty of outlets, they all seemed to sell the same food. If you don't like croissants with ham and cheese, cholesterol-raising pasties or diabetes-inducing pastries, you're buggered. I went without.The train to Lewes was blissfully empty, but this didn't stop a young woman sitting next to me and getting out her knitting. I quickly discovered how hard it was to concentrate on reading with a knitting needle popping into your line of vision.I will add knitting on trains to the very long list of things I intend to ban when I become Prime Minister in 2027."},

It's odd how some books are completely unaffected by the damp, whilst others look as if they're the remaining artefacts of a civilisation that was wiped out centuries ago, warped and covered in mold. But it's not all bad. Today is the first day that the farm dog hasn't tried to attack me. I feel accepted at last."},
{"title": "Sasek's London", "date": "Tuesday, January 29, 2013", "text": "One of my favourite books that I've come across recently is a large, illustrated hardback called 'This is London', by the Czech artist Miroslav Sasek.Published as part of a series that includes Paris, San Francisco, Rome and New York, Sasek's 1950s-style illustrations have gained a cult following and there is an excellent tribute website here. I'd been meaning to keep 'This is London' for myself, but forgot to remove it from sale. This morning, my heart sank when I saw that it had been snapped up by a gentleman in Spain. My loss is his gain.But before 'This is London' goes in the post, I thought I'd share some of the images. Sasek's book was published in 1959, so this is a London of City gents in bowler hats, chirpy Cockneys and, of course, this:By the time I was born, the infamous smogs were a thing of the past (partly thanks to our old friend Sir Gerald Nabarro), but it took several decades for London to lose its association with thick fog.I wonder if London will ever lose its association with most of the following images:Half a century on, the bowler hats have disappeared and the Cockneys have mostly moved out to Essex and Kent, whilst commuters are increasingly likely to be reading the Daily Telegraph on their smartphones. London feels very different to the place I knew as a child - better in some ways, worse in others.I shall be in London on Sunday afternoon, as I'm going to see a friend in a concert called 'Songs My Mother Taught Me' (a bit of misnomer for a collection of complex 20th century choral pieces; unless it was a very aspirational, middle class mother). But before that, I'm going to see this:It looks slightly more promising than Martin Creed's Turner prize-winning work: the lights going on and off."},

On the way up I passed Viscount Gage, who was on horseback, nonchalantly gesturing with his riding crop as I slowed down. The Firle estate has belonged to the Gage family for over 500 years.Virginia Woolf used to walk along the top of the Downs to visit her sister at Charleston. On days like this, I imagine her fragile, bird-like frame trudging through the snow.I find this time of year difficult. The lack of light, the greyness and the penetrating cold is enervating.

I have popped in to work to pick the orders and make sure that they are posted. It's a fag having to do a 16-mile round trip for a few packages, but my seller ratings depend on the speed of delivery.Glancing at the orders, I notice that there are a several titles that have sold many times over the last year. The bestselling one used to go for around £5, but now fetches at least £15, so the demand must exceed the supply. I wonder why the publishers haven't reissued these books.I have a pile of Pelicans in front of me. I love this series, particularly the ones printed during the 1960s and 70s, when they had witty, strking covers like this:But the ones that amuse me most are those from the 1940s and 50s. The uniform cover designs aren't particularly exciting:But I love the back covers, with their potted author biographies and wonderful photos:There seem to have been two poses that were deemed appropriate for intellectual gentlemen like Sir Mortimer Wheeler: holding a pipe or head in hand:Richard WollheimA. L. Bacharach (no relation to Burt, sadly)    A defiantly pipeless and handless Roy Lewis, with a pensive looking Angus Maude William Baring PembertonConsidering that author photos on books were relatively rare in those days, it's odd that Pelican went to such lengths to get these mugshots on such a dry old range of titles. Did they think that they reader would feel reassured by a photograph of a serious-looking chap in tweeds?Perhaps it was to prove that Cecil Ffoulkes-Worthing was a real gentleman and not some bluestocking writing under a nom de plume, like George Eliot. Perish the thought!On the rare occasions that Pelican threw caution to the wind and published a title by a woman, the photo nearly always seemed to depict a Margaret Rutherford clone. Sadly, Pelican paperbacks are nearly always worthless. The huge print runs have meant that the supply will nearly always exceed the demand. My copies usually end up being recycled.I'll be going home soon, as it's too cold to work here. At the moment the countryside looks like this:It's nice if you're a small child, but I can't wait for the spring."},
{"title": "Matinée", "date": "Friday, January 18, 2013", "text": "One of the advantages (or possibly pitfalls) of being self-employed is that I can slope off to Brighton Marina in the afternoon and enjoy watching films in an almost empty cinema. Yesterday, I watched this:I knew next to nothing about the story, but dutifully went as my wife assured me that it was supposed to be good (I'm sure the fact that it starred Ewan McGregor had nothing to do with her choice) and it was. In fact it was so good, I had trouble believing that it could be a British film.Then I discovered that it was Spanish.The trailer's rather schmaltzy tone doesn't do justice to a film that was one of the most moving things I've seen for a long time. The child actors were excellent - a far cry from the stage school brats that make you end up rooting for the villains - and there was also a superb cameo from Geraldine Chaplin.My mother babysat. It's really useful having her live so near, but I'm worried that she's beginning to go a bit dotty. A question she asked yesterday \"What's that thing you put things in to make them hot?\" (answer - a microwave) reminded me of Alan Bennett's elderly mother, who said \"What's that thing you're on your own in?\" when she could no longer remember the word car.Of course, forgetting names is a natural part of getting old and I'm told that I only need to worry when my mother can't remember what things do. If I find her looking at an egg whisk with a bemused expression, then I'll start to panic.Earlier, I'd shown her a new website that has mapped the location of every known bomb that fell on London during the Blitz. I scrolled across to Richmond - where my mother grew up - and asked her to tell me what she remembered about the bombs. Richmond seemed to get off fairly lightly compared to central London. Look at the map for the City of London and it's remarkable that there are any pre-war buildings left.I was going to write a blog post about the collapse of the music chain HMV because it's a subject close to my heart (in 2006, HMV bought the company I worked for and merged it with Waterstone's), but it's already old news. One thing I would say is that the chain's collapse wasn't entirely inevitable. If the senior management had possessed the foresight to invest more in creating an online presence during the late 90s, it might have been a different story.Instead, HMV Media opened 50 new stores between 1997 and 2002 and allowed a new internet seller that nobody had ever heard of to become the first port of call for music and DVD sales. I actually tried to buy something from the HMV website in 1999, as they were the top music brand in Britain, but gave up in disgust as their site was so appalling.I think the former chairman of HMV - Alan Giles - has a lot to answer for. His lack of vision and short-termism meant that the company was always one step behind the huge changes that took place in 'entertainment retail' during the noughties. Imagine if they'd created their own version of iTunes, ready for the advent of broadband. Instead, they chased after the notoriously fickle under 25s and alienated their core market - blokes who buy a lot of CDs.I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. I think a lot of high-powered business people are idiots (at least, most of the ones I've met). Read the profiles of top business people in the Sunday Times and their book and film choices are nearly always depressingly moronic for people who are intelligent enough to run a multi-million pound company. I certainly wouldn't want to spend an evening with someone whose favourite album was Brothers in Arms and top book was The Bridges of Madison County. The people I find interesting and amusing usually turn out to be artists, journalists, ex-military, doctors, diplomats, academics, entrepreneurs, farmers, writers and, of course, booksellers. They're all very different, but the one thing they usually have in common is a sense of humour and an aversion to the sort of corporate nonsense that obfuscates the truth.It's just started snowing and I have a biography of Roald Amundsen to read. I might as well go the whole hog and put this on in the background:"},
{"title": "Cold Comfort Farm", "date": "Friday, January 11, 2013", "text": "I have been working alone today and apart from the sound of occasional gunfire and neighing horses, it is disconcertingly quiet. The barn I work in usually creaks and groans, but now it is eerily silent, as if hibernating for the winter. I am sitting in a 20' by 10' garden shed, with two convector heaters on full power. I still feel cold.The books are depressing me today. So many of them have clearly never been read and at times, it feels as if the whole publishing industry is founded on unwanted gifts. In the skip for new books are dozens of copies of the bestsellers of recent Christmases: Frankie Boyle's autobiography, a Top Gear annual, all of Dan Brown's ouevre and countless celebrity memoirs. Very few of them are well-thumbed.During these silent afternoons of muted light and creeping coldness, I find it hard not to think about my own mortality. Dealing with the detritus of the recently deceased, I'm only too aware that one day it will be my books and photographs that will be turned into lampshades, packaging and road surfacing material. I have asked people to start saving photos and albums, without telling them why and several things have arrived during the last week. The best was a collection of pictures of a Sussex family taken between 1927 and 1929.None of the images are particularly remarkable, but what interests me is that they show a society in transition. The older generation - all born during the mid-Victorian age - don't appear to have change their style of dress at all. The photo below could have been taken any time in the late nineteenth century, except that the boy is holding a model plane:As usual, there are no names, but the locations are all in Sussex. The people in these pictures, particularly the older ones, would probably have spoken with a strong rural burr that was quite different from today's sub-London accent. Click here and you'll hear a real Sussex accent.The increasingly independent young women of the 1920s must have shocked their grandparents, who had seen their slowly-changing world completely torn apart by the First World War. It's not the past that's a foreign country, it's the future and if you live long enough, you'll be a stranger in a strange land."},

{"title": "Victory", "date": "Saturday, January 05, 2013", "text": "Portsmouth. It should be such a lovely place - a historic naval dockyard, Charles Dickens' birthplace and a wealth of literary associations, from  Nicholas Nickleby to Mansfield Park. But sadly an unholy alliance of the Luftwaffe and postwar town planners have brought this city to its knees. It was probably always a bit rough, with all of those jolly tars wandering the streets, but was it ever this ugly? In fairness, the local authorities have tried to spruce up the place recently and the Spinnaker Tower is a striking landmark: But the only real solution to Portsmouth's woes would be to bulldoze most of the postwar buildings and replace them with a mixture of pre-1940 replicas (à la Warsaw) and some well-designed modern alternatives. Naturally, you'd need a contemporary art gallery as well, to attract some middle class people from Stoke Newington.The ship above is the HMS Warrior - the world's first iron-hulled warship. It boasts an array of impressive statistics about armaments, horse power and speed, but I'm more interested in the interior design. I like to be comfortable:This all looks terribly civilised, as does this:Perfectly fine for a Second Lieutenant and probably no more spartan than their room at Harrow, but blow stairs it was a different story. The HMS Warrior had ten boilers that were heated by four large stoves each. The combined heat of 40 stoves created a working temperature of 120f and the men who worked there were paid an extra 25%, to compensate for the appalling conditions.I'd decided to take my younger son here for a visit to the HMS Victory, but ended up buying a ticket for the entire dockyard. It was an odd place with a rather rum selection of visitors, including an eight-year-old boy who was dressed like a 1920s country squire, with a Herringbone Tweed jacket and matching cap. He was accompanied by an old man with ancient hearing aids that were so large, they looked as if they could pick up echoes from the Big Bang, or the movements of enemy submarines.As we approached the Victory, I saw two of the Royal Navy's new top secret stealth warships:I couldn't help wondering why these 'top secret' vessels had been docked right next to a major tourist attraction. Shouldn't they be in a remote part of Scotland? The Hood from Thunderbirds wouldn't need his secret camera here:Can you see them behind the Victory, or has their stealth technology defeated my digital camera?We'd booked a guided tour around the HMS Victory and I was looking forward to gory tales of Nelson's death, maggot-infested biscuits and hasty amputations. Unfortunately the tour was ruined by the behaviour of several children, who kept banging and rattling every artefact they came across. One particularly dippy woman allowed her 18-month-old to stagger freely around the decks until it inevitably had a collision with a sharp object.However, in between the interuptions, I managed to learn that Nelson was pickled in brandy so that his body could be preserved for a state funeral, Captain Hardy was 6'4\" and amputations were performed without the benefit of alcohol.After the tour I congratulated my son for behaving impeccably and decided to reward him with a visit to an antique amusement arcade that included familiar machines like the menacing Jolly Sailor and the Fortune Telling Lady. However, there was one that I'd never seen before: Pop 20p in the slot and the doors will open, to reveal a reconstruction of the public hanging of James Aitken, alias 'John the Painter' - a man who supported the colonial rebels in America and expressed his solidarity by setting fire to the rope and pitchyard store in the dockyard at Portsmouth. The animated execution was a little grim for small children and I regretted finding the extra 20 pence piece.As we reached the end of the visit, I wondered what my son had got out of it. I'd become so jaded by a succession of disastrous visits to museums and buildings with his older brother, I'd almost given up the day trips. Perhaps all children hated them.I looked at my son. He was happy, skipping along the dockyard path with a shy smile on his face. On the way back, we talked about future days out and my son suddenly announced his plans for going to university. He seemed to have an appetite for life. Why was his brother so different?As we left Portsmouth, I saw a sign that pointed the way to Charles Dickens' birthplace. I'd missed it for the third time. I told my son, who paused for a moment, then turned to me and said: \"Wouldn't it be funny if they'd had computer games in the Stone Age.\""},

I'm not quite sure how to dry out an 8,000 square foot warehouse without spending a fortune on industrial equipment, but perhaps I should take the advice of my seven-year-old son, who told me to hire something for a couple of months until the weather changes.It's a bittersweet moment when your child has a better grasp of business than you do and I felt a mixture of pride and shame (just like I did a few weeks ago, when my mother's poem was published in the Daily Mail).I'm now working in partnership with someone who owns a company selling modern books. My stock is essentially a waste product of his business, so the arrangement suits both of us. It's too early to say how successful we will be, but it beats working for other people.I miss the camaraderie of working with others, but when a friend told me that she recently had to attend a 'team building treasure hunt' and a course entitled 'From bolt-on to centre of gravity', the mud and cows suddenly seemed a lot more attractive.I've been working through a large consigment of stock recently and every few boxes, I have found a photo that has been used as a bookmark.

And don't forget to share what you're doing today with the friends in your life\". At some point in the past, I must have lied to them about my date of birth - I was born in March. But like birthdays, today is a time of reflection and looking forward.I can't say that I have particularly enjoyed 2012. Some years leave you with a store of fond memories - a montage of days out, meetings with friends and personal achievements - but  this one was largely defined by illness and uncertainty. The most positive thing I could say about 2012 is that it has been a year of learning.However, the year wasn't without its positive moments. On the plus side, I worked here during the summer:I also enjoyed a magical evening in Seville:Wandering around an almost-deserted Alcázar Palace in the early evening, more than made up for the terrifying drive through the back streets of the city centre. But apart from a few very enjoyable drinks with old friends, I did very little this year. I intend to make up for lost time in 2013.One plan for next year that has been shelved is our decision to get a dog. The border terrier that stayed with us during the summer has come for Christmas, but after an emotional reunion, my oldest son has shown little interest in taking it out for walks - having a dog in winter is clearly less appealing. When, on Christmas Day, he solemnly annouced that he'd changed his mind about getting a dog, I felt a huge sense of relief - 2013 already looks good.I'll finish this very brief post by saying a sincere thank you to anyone who has taken the time to read this blog. Whoever you are, wherever you are, I wish you health and happiness in 2013."},
{"title": "\"Do you have that cookery book with the red cover?\"", "date": "Friday, December 28, 2012", "text": "After six months on Twitter, I have realised that it probably isn't for me, or I'm not for it. But I love reading other people's tweets (especially when they're not telling you about their cat or the great review their latest novel has just had).I particularly enjoyed this tweet from a few days ago, by bookseller @lucyfishwife:A customer asked me where we kept kids' books for 20-yr-olds. I pointed at the Fiction section.How I miss dealing with the general public. It's now over five years since I last dealt with a customer face to face. Although I still sell books, I don't dare to call myself a bookseller any more because I think that unless you're prepared to meet your public, you're merely a supplier. Internet bookselling is like cybersex, stripped of the agonies and ecstacies of real human contact. I love it.Real bookselling was a little like Russian Roulette - you never knew whether the person approaching your desk was going to ask a normal question like \"Do you have a copy of X by Z?\" or a completely daft one like \"I live in Surrey but have a holiday home in Staffordshire. Do you have a book of walks that just covers Surrey and Staffordshire?\" (a genuine question, by the way).Reading @lucyfishewife's anecdote reminded me of some of the gems I've been asked over the years:\"Could you recommend a book for someone who only has three weeks to live?\" (I suggested short stories)\"It says Biography and Memoirs. Why don't you have an autobiography section?\"\"I want that new gardening book. The title? No, I can't remember. Author? Oh, it's a lady and it's green. Do you have it?\"\"Where's your non-fiction section?\" Asked by a middle-aged man with a fruity voice and dyed hair. I replied that it was the whole shop, apart for the fiction and children's sections, and that it was divided up into separate subjects. Minutes later, he came downstairs shouting \"Your non-fiction section is impenetrable!\"\"I want a novel with a moral dilemma.\" (Which is like saying \"I'd like a motor car with an engine\")\"Do you read?\" I often replied, very politely, \"Yes, I do. *Long pause* Do you?\"\"Why have you moved your fiction section downstairs? Last year it was upstairs.\" When I replied that it had always been downstairs since we'd opened, two months ago, suggesting that they were confusing us with another shop, the customer shook their head, \"No, it was definitely here and it was upstairs.\"\"Will I like this?\" Asked by a heavily made-up woman in her late 60s, waving a copy of Foucault's Pendulum. I wanted to say \"How the **** should I know?\", but smiled sweetly and said \"You'll love it\", which turned out to be the right answer.\"Where's your section of coffee table books about Paraguay?\" Try Paraguay.\"Do you have any books about sex with animals?\" The same man asked this question on a weekly basis.\"Have you got that book about cholera?\" I asked if he meant Marquez. He nodded, but then leaned forward and said, rather patronisingly, \"Actually, it's pronounced Marqeth.\" His smug, punchable face was a picture when I patiently explained the difference between Castillian and Latin American Spanish.\"That book you recommended to me last week? It was crap.\" No, you were just too dim to appreciate it. \"If I ordered the book now, could you get it in time for Christmas Day?\" Asked at 3.15pm on Christmas Eve.As time went on, my answers became more confident. When the customer who wanted coffee table books on Paraguay huffed and puffed about our glaring omission, I could confidently point out that this was the first time in ten years that anyone had asked me for a book about Paraguay. I also knew how cheeky I could be without provoking a complaint, perfecting a subtle insoucience that Jeeves would have been proud of.But in the end, you get battle fatigue. A man I worked with who was 17 years older than me had become an embittered Basil Fawlty figure, picking unnecessary fights with perfectly harmless customers because he was at the end of his tether. When I saw how he treated a poor woman who'd innocently asked for a self-help book by Betty Shine, I made a mental note to get out of bookselling before I became like him.We lost touch, but two years ago I bumped into my ex-colleague at a historic building, where he was a voluntary guide. He seemed happier than he'd ever been in the bookshop. I knew how he felt."},
{"title": "Don We Now Our Gay Apparel (Fa la la la la, la la la la)", "date": "Monday, December 24, 2012", "text": "Yesterday evening, my wife and I set off for a Christmas party in Lewes, with a hastily-bought bottle of Pinotage that promised \"smoky, bramble flavours with a hint of tropical fruit\". Thankfully it didn't have a comedy label like 'Mad Goat', but I still wished that I'd gone to Waitrose.After walking for five minutes along a succession of dark, damp, slug-infested alleys, I asked my wife how much further the house was. She looked confused: \"I don't know. You're the one with the address.\" At that point, I realised that neither of us knew where we were going.A man walked past and looked at the bottle of wine. I felt embarrassed, as if he could tell that we were lost. My wife looked ahead and started walking purposefully: \"I'm pretty sure it's just up here. It's either 50 or 15. We'll know by the noise.\"Sady, there was no noise. We walked past a succession of eerily quite homes, occasionally catching glimpses of flickering television screens or people sitting around tables, but unless it was a very sedate party, we were in the wrong street. We turned round and started to walk home, when my wife suddenly said \"Ah!\"Walking in the opposite direction were a couple that she recognised, also clutching a bottle of wine. \"Is this it?\" she asked. They nodded. The door opened and we entered a silent house.It turned out that the party was a victim of the norovirus, with eleven couples cancelling, leaving a small rump of guests. At first, this seemed like a great misfortune, but I ended up having a much better evening than usual.Parties can often be rather painful affairs unless you know most of the people there. You walk into a room full of unfamiliar faces, where everyone else seems to know each other. They don't, but that's always how it looks. Terrified of being the person who isn't talking to anyone, you spin out the process of hanging up your coat and handing over the bottle of wine, quickly scanning for any possible openings.I always manage to find someone to talk to and they often seem as relieved as I am when I introduce myself. Then, for the next half hour, we go through the motions of asking each other what we do, which part of London we're from and why we're glad we moved to Lewes. So far so good.Unfortunately, after getting off to a flying start, the conversation enters the danger zone, where paranoid thoughts start to flash through your head: \"Am I monopolising this person? Are they getting bored. Am I getting bored? Would it be rude to go off to get a drink...\" This is the aspect of parties that I always hate. Sometimes I wish that someone would just ring a bell and we'd all have to shuffle round, a bit like speed dating.But on the other hand, it can be good to be stuck with someone for long enough to exhaust the polite platitudes and start to get a glimpse of the real person. Last week, I met an odd-looking man who was dressed like an overgrown boy scout, with a face that resembled a Spitting Image puppet and a voice like a 1970s station announcer at Clapham Junction. He didn't seem to have any sense of humour and I thought \"Oh God, this is going to be hard work.\"Then, during the next half hour, he managed to destroy all of my first impressions by turning out to be one of the most interesting people I've met, with an extraordinary past. He had a sense of humour too. As if I needed any further evidence of how wrong I'd been, after half an hour, a beautiful woman at the other end of the room came up and told him that it was time to go.In fairness, most of the women seemed quite beautiful that evening, whereas the poor men were represented by a sea of bespectacled, balding heads. I wish that we could 'scrub up' like the ladies, but the combination of a hot, humid room and 'Just for Men' would have made it look more like Death in Venice. Last night's party was more of a gathering, but I enjoyed it a lot more. Without the noise and crush of a crowded room, the conversation seemed to flow more freely. I met some lovely people and lost track of the time, which is always a good sign.We left at 10.30 - earlier than I would have liked - but when we turned into our road, I could see my mother anxiously twitching the curtains, as if I was still her teenage son. Some things never change. Christmas Day will be a fairly sedate affair. My wife and I are both only children and don't have many living relatives. Unfortunately, that hasn't stopped my wife from behaving as if she's preparing for a royal wedding. I'm keeping my head down. In two days it will all be over.Merry Christmas!"},
{"title": "Les Rosbifs", "date": "Sunday, December 16, 2012", "text": "Ah, the south of France... The sophistication. The culture. The cuisine...Imagine that it's the early 1980s and you are a bona fide member of the chattering classes. In the days before you had children, you wouldn't have thought twice about blowing a month's wages on a few nights at the Hotel de Ville, but times have changed. Jane is no longer working and the mortgage on your five-bedroom house in an 'up and coming' part of Balham has made a dent on your disposable income, so sacrifices have to be made.Once, camping would have been an anathema to both of you, but now that Christopher and Emily are at kindergarten, you wonder if it wouldn't be rather fun to have an al fresco holiday. Not camping of course, but Le Camping.One day in late July, you load up the Volvo (making sure that there's enough room to to bring back a few bottles of plonk for Tim and Amanda) and begin the long trek to the spiritual home of the cognoscenti: Provence.The journey ends 36 hours later, just as the light is failing, in an idyllic rural setting where the air smells of pine needles and olive groves. It has been a long drive, but you are now certain that it was worth it. Exhausted but happy, you unload the basics and enjoy the sleep of the just.The next morning you wake up and realise that you have neighbours. Like you, they are English, but...In their Hillman Hunter, your neighbours have followed a similar trajectory, stopping en route to enjoy the delights of Paris:But you sense that their tastes are different to yours and after hearing the same Kagagoogoo song for the seventh time, you decide to ask Yves about moving to a quieter part of the site. He'll understand - \"Ah, oui, les rosbifs. Mon dieu!\"In the meantime, Dot, Ray, Kevin and Gary are having the time of their lives, although the boys have an unfortunate habit of clutching their genitals whenever a photo is taken:Dot didn't want to come here. She would have rather gone to the usual place in Sandy Bay, but Ray had some funny ideas about the south of France and now that she's here, Dot reluctantly concedes that she's having 'a bit of a laugh'.Although holidaying with three males is no picnic. The mess in the morning...I'd love to know the real narrative behind these photos. They appeared at work last week and my first impression was one of disappointment - just a collection of blurry, Kodak Instamatic snaps. But then curiosity took over. Where did these people come from and what were their real names? What made them choose the south of France? Are they all still alive now? Before long I was making up my own narrative, imagining them leaving somewhere a bit grim, like Luton, vicariously enjoying their excitement at seeing the blue skies of Provence for the first time. But that's probably all nonsense. In the digital age, albums will no longer fall into the hands of strangers. Photos will either disappear into the ether or exist in the purgatory of cyberspace, forgotten and unvisited.I think it's time to have a proper album again."},
{"title": "Thursday Matinée", "date": "Thursday, December 13, 2012", "text": "I woke up in the middle of the night with crippling stomach cramps, so today has been a bit of a write-off. But on the plus side, I've been able to lie in bed and watch this:The film isn't quite as absurd as the trailer suggests and gives a fascinating glimpse of a rarely-seen side of Britain during the 1950s. But the main attraction is a cast that includes Sean Connery, Patrick McGoohan, Stanley Baker, Sid James, David McCallum and the unbiquitous Alfie Bass. If you like seeing goods vehicle drivers flagrantly disregarding the Highway Code, I can thoroughly recommend Hell Drivers.I also watched a film that I loved as a child. Sadly, on second viewing, it turned out to be even more ridiculous than I'd anticipated:If you haven't seen it, I'll save you the effort. The film begins with the revelation that the world is going to end. In spite of this rather depressing news, everyone continues going to work and behaving quite normally, apart from a small group of people who decide to build a 'rocketship' that will act as a modern Noah's Ark, taking a selection of animals (probably not wasps) and 40 young white people (probably WASPS) to an approaching planet that might be able to support life. The world blows up, consumed by a star. Fortunately, the spaceship has escaped in the nick of time and managed to make a successful landing on the new planet. When the hatch is opened for the first time, the crew are greeted by a well-manicured lawn and a poorly-executed watercolour landscape. In the distance, there is a strange alien monolith, but nobody sees remotely surprised or interested. The end.However, I don't waste all of my time watching films like When Worlds Collide. This 2011 film, which I have also seen recently, is excellent:Beautifully filmed and acted, with a surprisingly effective score by Philip Glass, Elena deservedly won the Special Jury Prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a new film as much.I hope that my stomach behaves itself in time for Saturday, as we're going to what my wife ominously described as a 'killing party'. I was very relieved when I realised that she meant a 'Killing' party, where all of the guests had to bugger off before BBC 4 screens the final two episodes of the Danish thriller series.How very Lewes."},
{"title": "The Last Noel", "date": "Saturday, December 08, 2012", "text": "I took this just over an hour ago, as I was leaving work. It looks quite idyllic, but that's because you can't see the mud or experience the smell of rotting hay. I've never been anywhere so filthy. Spring seems a long way away.But whenever I start to feel demoralised by the biting cold winds and short days, I remind myself that at least I'm no longer working in a bookshop at Christmas.All retailers experience seasonal fluctuations, but few are more dependent on the Christmas period than the book trade, with 50% of the annual turnover packed into the last two months of the year. The frenetic pace is a far cry from the quiet, civilised image of bookselling.When I worked at Ottakar's, a good Christmas meant pay rises, new shops and a managers' meeting abroad. A bad one resulted in a pay freeze, no shops and a meeting in Birmingham. At Ottakar's, Christmas always began in March, when the lead titles for the autumn were revealed at the annual managers' conference, in a migraine-inducing Powerpoint presentation of book covers and loud music. Sometimes it felt as if we were watching a repeat of the previous year: Jamie Oliver, Nigella, Terry Pratchett, token sportsperson, token rock star, Wilbur Smith, quirky humour title, lavish history hardback, beautiful pop-up children's title, reckless attempt at in-house publishing, celebrity memoir, 'lyrical' literary novel and the obligatory amusing travelogue.At some point in the presentation, the managing director would address the 120-odd managers and try to persuade them that this was the most crucial Christmas ever. Even more crucial than last year's most crucial Christmas ever. How much of this actually registered with the managers was debatable, as many of them were busy concentrating on trying not to be sick or fall over, after enjoying the previous evening's free bar.After March, we would forget about Christmas for two months. Then, one day in June, the publishers' reps would begin arriving with larger folders containing the 'blad' for the autumn titles. The festive season had begun.Once, managers were responsible for ordering everything for their shop, but after the collapse of the Net Book Agreement, chain bookstores began buying the lead titles centrally. Commercially it made sense. Instead of 100 shops ordering small quantities of titles, a buyer at head office level would place one huge order for the whole chain, gaining an extra 9 to 10% discount from the publisher, which could then be used to provide a 'money off' offer to the customer. Once the stock had arrived, it was the manager's job to ensure that they identified the bestselling titles and reordered enough stock to last them until Christmas eve.This wasn't always as easy as it sounded. A book that had sold 11 copies a week in October might conceivably sell 200 a week in December, but if it didn't, you would be left with boxes of unsold stock and incur the wrath of your superiors.The obvious answer was to only order enough stock to get you through the next two weeks. Unfortunately, this was a risky strategy, as some books regularly went into reprint (particularly if the author had just appeared on Jonathan Ross) and being out of stock of a Sunday Times Top 10 bestseller was even worse having too many copies of a dud celebrity memoir (the most notorious of which was Anthea Turner's autobiography, which reached No.457 in the bestseller charts).But even if you managed to get your stock levels exactly right, the shop could still grind to a halt if you'd forgotten to order enough bags or failed to increase your change float. As for staffing, I've lost count of the number of times my perfect rota would be sabotaged by someone phoning in to say that they had \"a bit of a cold\".Getting the staff levels right was always a challenge. Instead of opening from 9.00am to 5.30pm, the working day increased each week until, a few days before Christmas, it lasted for 13 hours. As a manager, I had to plan two or three staggered shifts, ensure that the tills were covered during lunch breaks and also provide enough muscle to deal with the deliveries, which were at least four times their normal volume. As for the customers, sometimes the shop felt like the Storming of the Bastille: During the final week before Christmas, I would invariably end up working for 13-hour days, dividing my time between placing last-minute hotline orders, unpacking deliveries, replenishing the tables and helping on the tills. By Christmas Eve, I had reached a point of exhaustion where I felt as if I had flu and, sadly, was rarely in the mood for a family celebration the following day.Indeed, two months of grumpy customers, long opening hours, semi-hysterical emails from Head Office and a loop tape of carols did tend to kill off any latent Christmas spirit and when the 25th finally arrived, I had to pretend to be full of festive cheer. But at least I now had a break.15 years ago, we used to enjoy a three-day holiday (returning on the 28th for a delightful day of people returning unwanted presents). This gave booksellers whose families lived hundreds of miles away enough time to travel home for Christmas (particularly as I would always close the shop early on the 24th).But gradually this changed. As high street sales began to be affected by internet and supermarket competition, the pressure to open longer and close for fewer days increased each year. When I left bookselling, Christmas Eve was no longer a comparatively relaxed half day, but a frantic operation in which the shop was prepared for the sales. Also, the three-day break had now contracted to just the 25th. In spite of everything, I used to get a buzz from bookselling at Christmas. Ottakar's was a good company to work for. But by the time HMV had bought the chain, it was no longer any fun. I did not appreciate receiving the 'planograms' that told me where to put my books, or the boorish senior manager whose sole mission seemed to be to find fault with everything he saw (a stark contrast to the Ottakar's managing director, who could have restored morale on the sinking Titanic).One day, almost exactly five years ago, I drove to work on a frosty Saturday morning and parked my car a few hundred yards away from the shop I managed. As I walked through the deserted town centre, I asked myself what could worse than losing my job and the answer suddenly became very clear: keeping it. I left that evening and never returned. Five years on, for the first time since the 1980s, I have managed to listen to 'Carols From Kings' without breaking out into a cold sweat (although I still feel like punching someone when I hear 'Let It Snow'). Perhaps some vestige of the Christmas spirit remains!I'm sure that there are some bookshops out there where the Christmases are still enjoyable, but even if you're an independent or work for an enlightened employer, it must be very demoralising to have to compete with Amazon and the supermarkets. I think I'm better off with the mud and cows."},
{"title": "A Jolly Crew", "date": "Friday, November 30, 2012", "text": "Yesterday I found some more children's illustrations from the 1930s - an age when schoolgirls called Shirley and Susan would be praised for having plenty of pluck and spunk.The relentless cheerfulness is slightly less menacing than contemporary paintings of the Komsomol and Hitler-Jugend youth movements, but it still looks as if it wouldn't have been a good time to be a Smiths fan.On the other hand, it's good to see girls portrayed as self-reliant, athlectic and resourceful - a refreshing contrast to the fragile, consumptive angels of Victorian children's annuals.This girl certainly knows how to handle herself:  In fact, all of the characters appear to very sporty. There isn't even the token plump girl with glasses called Brenda, who likes reading books - in her spare time! \"Well Played!\"   \"Take that!\"\"A good run in mid-field\" \"Ready to start\"\"I say! Is it true that Beryl's been taking flying lessons at the aerodrome? She really is a caution. I wonder what Miss Fothergill would say if she found out.\"  \"Well matched!\"There's no room for Jacqueline Wilson-style social issues in these upbeat tales of fair play, team spirit and moral courage. The only single-parent families you'll find are the ones in which Daddy was killed in the line of duty at Passchendaele.It must have been hard to relate to stories like these if you were working class, unsporty and lacking in sufficient 'jolliness'.Boys annuals weren't much better, but did at least occasionally dwell on the darker side of human nature: \"A daring feat, performed by a police inspector in Buckingham Palace Road, when he jumped from his car at high speed and prevented bandits from escaping.\"I particularly admire the way the inspector's hat remains firmly in place, even at speeds exceeding 37mph.But it wasn't just children who were bombarded with role-models:I'm assuming that this is Daddy returning home from work, rather than a sinister stranger staring through the window at an unsuspecting mother and child. It all looks terribly idyllic, but for many it was an uttainable ideal. In spite of this, perhaps these role models are still better than many of today's. As for me, my roles models as a child were, in no particular order: Jack Hawkins, Mr Spock, Sid James, Virgil Tracy, Leslie Phillips, Mr Blunden, Aslan, Doctor Who, Brian Cant, Admiral Nelson (the Richard Basehart version), Roger Moore, Gambit from The New Avengers, Basil Brush, Gary Glitter (yes, I know), 'Robot' from Lost in Space, Professor Pat Pending and the Milk Tray man.This probably explains a lot."},
{"title": "Off the Rails", "date": "Monday, November 26, 2012", "text": "On Saturday afternoon I walked in the dark through heavy rain to Lewes station, listening to Kate Bush's Hounds of Love album for the first time since the 1980s. I've no idea what possessed me to download that particular album, but it was a Kate Bush sort of day. By the time I arrived at the station I was cold and wet, but the arriving train offered an hour of warmth, light and comfort while it slowly made its way to Hastings. I found a window seat, gave up on The Big Sky and skipped to the far superior Mother Stands For Comfort. Suddenly I was back in the front room of my home in Teddington, lying on the garish pink carpet of our lounge. As Noel Coward (another Teddington resident) once wrote, \"Extraordinary how potent cheap music is\". Sitting in the aisle next to mine was a 50-something air stewardess who was so heavily made-up that she unfortunately looked like a transexual. I wondered what it must be like to spend so many years in a job that was perceived by many as glamorous, but in reality offered little but tedium and stress, with the added pressure of having to match the energy and enthusiasm of younger colleagues. I was now on what used to be the b-side of the Hounds of Love and lamented the demise of the vinyl album, where each side had its own distinct identity and a sense of it being a thing in itself, rather than simply a medium for listening to music. I loved the act of removing the sleeve from the album, followed by the slight, static resistance of the record as you tried to pull it out, the faint smell of vinyl, the alignment of the hole with the centre and the bump of the stylus landing on the lead-in to the first track, followed by a few seconds of click-filled silence.Ahhh...Of course, at the time the clicks drove me crazy and if someone had told me that in 25 years, someone would invent a device that stored hundreds of hours of music  and  played with hiss and click-free sound, I would have been delighted. I noticed a slight movement in the corner of my eye and saw that the stewardess was looking at me and smiling, as if in response to a joke that we'd shared earlier. A voice announced the next station and the stewardess raised her eyes as if to say \"See what I mean?\"After Jig of Life, which I still like, I decided to abandon Kate Bush. I can happily listen to a piece of classical music that I loved 30 years ago, but revisiting an once-loved album always leaves me with mixed feelings. At Bexhill the air hostess turned to me again and looked around the carriage in mock-exasperation. I had clearly missed something. I shrugged my shoulders in a \"C'est la vie!\" manner and hoped that this was the right response. It seemed to be.At Hastings I met up with an old colleague from Ottakar's.12 years ago we both worked in London and regularly met up for drinking sessions in a variety of louche pubs for a cathartic rant about the people who were annoying us. I always enjoyed our drinks, but sometimes they got out of hand. One morning I woke up to discover a third degree burn on my leg and to this day, I have no idea how it happened.During a slightly more restrained drink at the First In Last Out pub, we talked about how much we missed working in the book trade where, at the time, we felt that we were part of something. We went to launch parties, read novels months before they were published and enjoyed some wonderfully surreal encounters with authors. We had fun.The contrast between the quiet, mud-filled world of the present and the noisy, stimulating world of the past nagged at me. Suddenly, I wished I was leaving work in South Kensington and catching a 49 bus to Clapham Junction, where I'd meet some friends in an absurd bar with a swimming pool. But then I remembered that when I was sitting in those bars, drinking absinthe with someone I'd met 15 minutes earlier, I dreamed of ending up somewhere like here:The moral of the story could be that boring old \"Be careful what you wish for...\" cliche that's regularly trotted out. I do find my life a little too monastic these days. However, I would hate to be one of those launch party stalwarts who never move on, still knocking back the bottles of Becks in their mid-40s, unsuccessfully trying to chat-up a publishing assistant who could be their daughter.I turned to my ex-colleague: \"I think we miss being younger and the book trade before it became a bit crap\". Not a terribly eloquent summing-up, but I was on my third pint. She agreed.It's one of life's tragedies that alcohol liberates the mind, only to enslave it in banal, half-baked assertions that don't withstand any degree of scrutiny. However, we were abstemious enough to reach several conclusions:1. It was fun while it lasted, but it had to end (insert youth, getting away with it or any other apposite phrase). 2. Bookselling isn't what it used to be.3. We loved the books, but never really enjoyed managing bookshops. Once we found ourselves in charge of 15 people, responsible for the tedious administration tasks that resulted from this, our enthusiasm waned.We finished the evening with a curry and as we walked back to Hastings station, I felt a sense of gratitude that I had met so many good people through the book trade. I may spend my days working amongst consumptive calves, listening to Polish techno music and Heart FM power ballads, but a warm pub and good conversation are only an email away."},
{"title": "The Art of Seeing", "date": "Tuesday, November 20, 2012", "text": "I've been feeling a little stale recently, so yesterday morning I set off on a walk through Lewes, trying to regain the sense of novelty and wonder I felt when I first moved here, 11 years ago. I had no idea where I was going or how long it would take, but knew that my journey should include some unfamiliar roads.In a town the size of Lewes, it could be a challenge to find a different route. But like the human circulatory system, if you unravelled the streets and twittens of Lewes, they would probably extend for hundreds of miles. Everywhere you go in the town, there are narrow passageways that have defied the best attempts of Google to comprehensively map the local area. It is a medieval town that was built for people, not cars.Here, in no particular order, are some of the things that caught my eye: I've always loved Hugh Rae, the gentlemen's outfitters, with its elegant art deco font: However, the frontage belies the fact that the actual building is more 1330s than 1930s: In 20 years' time, I shall be coming to Hugh Rae for my Harris tweed suits, if they're still around. Sadly, with the sartorial standards of the older generation in rapid decline (only yesterday I saw a man in his 70s wearing a fleece and trainers) I sometimes wonder if the Hugh Raes of this world will survive. Perhaps the Government should offer additional pension credits for the wearing of cravats and ties.During the walk, I kept reminding myself to look up as well as ahead and was rewarded with the sight of an urn placed on a 15-foot-high tree stump. Maybe it's someone's ashes.This unusual view, taken at the end of Castle Ditch Lane, shows the town's oldest building (circa 1069), next to one of its newest.I must have walked past Gideon Mantell's house hundreds of times without noticing this curious keystone.Another view of the 1330 building, as seen from St Martin's Lane. This lane takes you down a steep hill to an area called Southover:This is Southover Grange, which was built in the 16th century out of the stones from the recently-dissolved Lewes Priory of St Pancras. The diarist John Evelyn spent most of his childhood here. Today it's owned by the local council, who maintain one of the most beautiful public gardens I've come across.In the spring, a small cafe opens and the gardens suddenly fill with young families and teenagers on their way home from school. I made this short film about Southover Grange a couple of years ago.The gardens used to have a tree that was on the verge of collapsing and an area with a sheer drop into a fast-flowing watercourse. These were both a huge hit with the local children, but the local health and safety spoilsports have erected some ugly, cheap wooden fencing. It's a great pity.My son won't go there any more, now that the threat of being swept away into an subterranean network of rivers has been removed.This wall betrays Southover Grange's origins.Like Gideon Mantell's house, I'd never noticed this feature before. I need to make a habit of looking up more often.This rusted pump sits on top of a well. I've always liked 'street furniture' of this kind.A Tudor window, where people probably film clips of fake ghosts to entertain the gullible on YouTube.On the subject of fake ghosts, I once held a book signing session with Derek Acorah and before he arrived, I spoke to his publisher's sales rep:\"There's just one thing you need to know about Derek. He never, ever drinks anything except sparkling spring water, so just get several bottles of that and he'll be perefectly happy.\"I dutifully went out and bought three bottles of  Tŷ Nant, which I placed in a tasteful arrangement on the signing table. Two hours later, he arrived: \"Hello Derek. Nice to meet you. Before you begin, can I get you anything to drink?\"\"Oh yeah, thanks very much Phil. I've have a coffee. White with one sugar.\" We didn't have any milk. Perhaps he was psychic after all.At Southover Grange, even the chimneys are interesting.This is in Keere Street, which connects Southover Grange with the High Street, via a steep climb that finishes at the famous 15th Century Bookshop. It's one of Lewes's most attractive streets and if you're lucky, you might catch a glimpse of Lord Briggs working in his study. At this point, I was almost home and could have switched off, but my walk had taught me to look again at buildings that I hadn't noticed for years. The doorway below is surrounded by 'mathematical tiles':Many of us travel thousands of miles in search of novelty, but perhaps the real challenge lies in finding it on your doorstep."},
{"title": "Lorsque les Billes Chuté (or Life Begins at 14)", "date": "Saturday, November 17, 2012", "text": "Walking home from school yesterday, I watched my two sons skipping ahead, earnestly discussing a computer game called Minecraft whilst jumping onto low garden walls and racing each other to the next lamp post. They could have been friends in the same class - one slightly taller than the other. When I tell people that the age gap between them is six years, they are always shocked.My oldest son increasingly reminds me of Oskar Mazerath in The Tin Drum - a boy who consciously decides to stop growing as a rejection of the adult world that awaits him. I've no idea why my son isn't growing, but I can only hope that when puberty eventually arrives, it will empower him.As today is my younger son's seventh birthday. I've been thinking about the Jesuit motto \"Give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man\" and wondering how true it is. My life up until the age of 14 seems like a nebulous, badly-written play in which I had a largely non-speaking part. However, the moment my voice broke, I felt as if I had become a clearly-defined person.I've no idea why a surge in testosterone should result in a new passion for Beethoven, Radio 4 and Ingmar Bergman films, but almost overnight, things that had once baffled and bored me were now utterly fascinating. I became interested in current affairs, bombarding the London embassies of various nations with requests for information about their countries. I also started avidly watching Newsnight.Since then, my tastes have changed remarkably little. There are some things that I can no longer stomach - Mahler symphonies, Radio 4 comedies and Constable - but I still enjoy many of the things that appealed to me 30 years ago. It's odd how a one-year growth spurt can seal a person's destiny.I hope that my older son's testicles are limbering up for a similar transformation. Some people look back on their childhood with fondness, but for me, life began at 14."},
{"title": "Found and Lost", "date": "Tuesday, November 13, 2012", "text": "I never find it easy revisiting old workplaces. Even when I've left under amicable circumstances, there is always an underlying awkwardness; almost like a meeting between former lovers. Behind the broad smiles, there is a subtle game of one-upmanship, with each party trying to demonstrate how much they've thrived since the split.A few weeks ago I returned to my last workplace to collect some stock. The department I'd created had now moved to a separate building and apart from one familiar face, the staff were all new. I felt as if I'd been erased from history. I wondered why the managing director had offered me my old job back a few months ago. The new building appeared to be well-organised and the staff seemed more industrious than ever. I felt slightly disappointed to see how well they were doing without me.People looked up with expressions that said \"Who on earth is he?\" and I couldn't wait to leave, but decided to make some polite conversation first. Before leaving the job, I'd told my successor about some unique items that we'd found: a 1591 Bible, a box of 17th century books and a collection of Victorian photo albums. I'd been tempted to take one of the albums with me, but it wasn't my property. I'd often wondered how much money the Bible had sold for.\"How did you get on with the Elizabethan Bible?\" I asked.There was an awkward silence for a few moments. \"Er...we lost quite a lot of stuff during the move.\"It now seems that the 1591 Bible, the Derek diaries and the Victorian photo albums weren't saved from oblivion after all. They merely enjoyed a brief reprieve.I'm sure you can imagine how I felt.I'm relieved that I made some high quality scans of the best of the photos. Many of the images have been shared on a number of websites, so the album survives, in a way. You can see the original blog post here and the full album is on this Flickr page. Sadly, poor old Derek hasn't been so lucky. His countless foolscap binders of carefully typed A4 diaries have been largely consigned to oblivion.I say largely, because I do have a little of Derek in my attic. I felt able to keep some of his diaries because they had no financial value, so there is probably one more Derek post in the pipeline. I owe him that.I feel haunted by the loss of the Bible and although I'm glad that I scanned the Victorian photographs, they feel anchorless without their original album. As for Derek, I'm sure that his complete diaries could have been turned into a good book by an experienced editor (however, I should add that finding the extracts I published was rather like panning for gold).Ironically, I now have enough storage space for thousands of Dereks, but hardly ever come across gems like these any more. Perhaps that will change when I find new suppliers.There are dozens of recycling companies all over Britain, largely staffed by people on minimum wage, working at great speed. They don't have the luxury of stopping to look properly at the tonnes of sacks and crates that arrive daily. If it's a book, save it. If it isn't, chuck it.I try not to think about the things that are thrown away. One day, when my business is on a more secure footing, I hope that I can devote more time to saving some of this ephemera, making the best of it available online.People's lives shouldn't be casually thrown into a skip."},
{"title": "Upstairs Downstairs", "date": "Saturday, November 10, 2012", "text": "The last few months have been a little challenging. In addition to the usual stresses of dealing with our oldest son, my wife developed pneumonia and during her treatment, blood tests seemed to reveal a condition that used to be fatal, but can now be treated with chemotherapy and steroids. We weren't told this straight away, but I had a feeling that something was wrong when my wife's GP started phoning us in the evening to ask how she was feeling.I was pretty upset at the prospect of seeing my wife undergo chemotherapy, but she was more concerned about the steroids: \"I can cope with the treatment, but I can't bear the idea of becoming fat.\"At one point it was all looking pretty grim and, selfishly, I wondered how I was going to cope with caring for four people, including an 83-year-old woman and a boy with special needs. At least I now had a working life with flexible hours, but was I really up to the challenge? I found myself becoming increasingly grumpy and anti-social towards the world at large.During this period, one of the things that helped to keep me sane was a boxed set of the original 'Upstairs Downstairs'. I am now halfway through the fourth series and when I reach the end, I'll probably feel compelled to write a blog post about the programme. In the meantime, here's something else that has been a source of huge delight.This is from the BBC Radio 4 website:'Upshares, Downshares', the PM programme's daily business and economics slot with Nils Blythe, charted the economic crisis daily from November 2008. Once the listeners (David Cartwright in fact) had named the slot, we began to play the original theme fromUpstairs Downstairs but then, unbidden, listeners began sending in their own renditions and interpretations of the tune.Here's the original:And here are some of the different versions created by Radio 4 listeners:First, \"in the style of George Shearing\":Next, Spaghetti Western:Third, Bossa Nova:And crumhorn trio:Electro-pop:Organ fugue:One of my favourites - 'acid house':Ancient handbells version:The Elvis version:Morris Dancing:Junior school recorder club version:And finally, the splendid 'Retro arcade game' version:This is only a small sample of the wonderful selection that bears witness to the ingenuity of BBC Radio 4 listeners. If more people devoted themselves to harmless pursuits like growing roses, collecting stamps and creating different versions of theme tunes, the world would be a better place.My wife and I are rapidly working our way through the 68 episodes of Upstairs Downstairs and when we reach the end, I feel that the it will also mark the conclusion of something else. Further blood tests have now shown that my wife doesn't have the condition that was initially diagnosed. There is something, but it's not life-threatening and won't require a gruelling regime of medicines (we hope). My wife is delighted that she won't have to put on weight. Sadly, I have, as a result of several months of comfort eating - those Waitrose macaroons are like crack cocaine - and I shall have to resume the tedious business of dieting. I'll make sure that the next drama series I watch isn't mainly set in a kitchen.However, it will have to have lines like these:"},

{"title": "Wishin' and Hopin'", "date": "Wednesday, November 07, 2012", "text": "One thing I've noticed about Mitt Romney and Barrack Obama during the last two months has been their desperate attempts to seem like 'regular guys'. Both have been dropping their 'gs' and talkin' about folks and bucks, rather than people and dollars.Obama has been thinkin' and hopin', whilst Romney has complained about folks bein'  tired of payin' nearly four bucks for a gallon of gas.What is it that makes a multi-millionaire and an aloof academic start adopting the speech patterns of a truck driver? Is it a cultural meme in the American psyche that associates a patrician accent with ancient forces of oppression? It didn't seem to do FDR any harm:But could any American politician get away with an accent like Roosevelt's today? I doubt it. One of the last politicians to speak with a distinct New England accent - Edward Kennedy - has been mercilessly lampooned through the figure of Mayor Quimby in the Simpsons.In England, perhaps the most powerful linguistic meme goes back to 1066, when the William of Normandy defeated King Harold and French became the language of the ruling class for nearly three centuries, whilst English went underground.600 years on, people still employ French phrases like \"Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose\" if they wanted to convey erudition and authority. Conversely, plain English stands for honesty and directness. Winston Churchill's famous \"Blood, sweat and tears\" speech was almost entirely Anglo-Saxon in origin.I suspect that similar forces have been at work in the Presidential election, with both candidates trying to out-normal each other by adopting the speech patterns of a mid-western everyman.I was particularly impressed by Mitt Romney, who was a genuinely charismatic figure. Unlike Ronald Reagan, who died his hair black, Romney used the 'Just For Men' approach, carefully allowing a little grey at the sideburns to give the illusion of a natural colour. It was a useful metaphor for Romney's policies which seemed to change hue a little too often.I'd like to think that Romney was rumbled for having no coherent policies, but I think the result was ultimately more about the changing demographic make-up of America. Romney was a 1984 candidate. The USA has changed and cheesy, handsome WASPs can no longer rely on empty rhetoric and a bottomless pit of corporate donors to guarantee victory.I can only assume that the Republicans will now do a lot of soul-searching and, if they have any sense, find a Hispanic candidate to upset the apple cart in 2016. Instead of folks and talkin', the meme will look further south.In the meantime, I was relieved to see that in Barack Obama's victory speech, he was once again hoping. So am I. Good luck, Mr President."},

{"title": "Ayn Rand - the Objectionable Objectivist", "date": "Thursday, November 01, 2012", "text": "This blog is currently in 'economy mode' as I'm in the middle of moving 7,000 books, along with the accompanying shelving, bolt by bolt. It's gruelling work. But on the plus side, if I had a latent heart problem, it would have probably manifested itself during the last seven days.In the meantime, here is a clip about Ayn Rand. I have to confess that when I first became a bookseller, I'd never heard of her. However, I quickly became intrigued by Rand because the only people who asked for her books were, without exception, utter and complete tossers.Who was this mysterious wanker-magnet?Several things are clear from watching this video. First, Steve Moore of the Wall Street Journal wears a wig. Second, Ayn Rand's body language is deeply disturbing, particularly the shifty eyes. Third, Paul Ryan is even more ghastly than I thought.I had thought of reading an Ayn Rand novel, in spite (or because) of Christopher Hitchens' description of them as \"transcendentally awful\", but unless I'm detained in an institution with a choice that is limited to either Atlas Shrugged or The Bridges of Madison County, it's not going to happen.In the meantime, let's ponder this pearl of wisdom from Ayn Rand:\"The ladder of success is best climbed by stepping on the rungs of opportunity\" That's so profound, it almost seems banal and fatuous. I wonder if it's on an 'inspirational' poster?Ayn Rand rings my alarm bells quicker than a Love and Hate tattoo. So far, I haven't seen any of her novels on friends' bookshelves, but my local taxi firm is on speed dial just in case.You can never be too careful."},
{"title": "South Riding", "date": "Monday, October 22, 2012", "text": "It may seem perverse to describe a novel that has been filmed once, adapted for television twice and never been out of print since publication, as a forgotten masterpiece. But now that I've read 'South Riding', I understand why people have applied this label to Winifred Holtby's last book.Holtby's story of provincial life didn't bowl me over from the first page. There seemed to be too many characters and I wasn't quite sure where the narrative was heading, but I persisted and my admiration began to grow with each chapter. By the end, I was convinced that I had read a novel that was every bit as good as 'Middlemarch'.Set during 1933-34, in a thinly-disguised part of Yorkshire that stretches from Hull to Horsea, South Riding is an ambitious novel with a cast of characters that range from the local gentry to a family living in slum accommodation. Many stories of this kind collapse under the weight of their own ambition, but Winifred Holtby pulls it off an aplomb that few writers could match.There are many reasons why South Riding works as a book, but here are just four. First and foremost, it has credible, three-dimensional characters that the reader cares about, with a very moving love story at the core of the novel . Second, although Holtby clearly has something to say about the condition of England, the narrative never feels as if it is being driven by a crude political agenda. Third, there is a good balance between the broad canvas of a community and the more intimate portraits of some of its citizens. Fourth, although South Riding contains many elements that wouldn't be out of place in a Victorian novel (including a homage to Charlotte Bronte), the author writes with a candour that must have shocked many contemporary readers. Perhaps South Riding was a little racy because Winifred Holtby had nothing to lose. Diagnosed with Bright's disease in 1931, the 33-year-old author was given two years to live. South Riding is the work of a dying woman, who put everything she had into her last work. The result is a passionate, life-affirming masterpiece. This isn't the place for a biographical sketch of Winifred Holtby or a summary of the narrative, but I should mention the fact that as the author was an active socialist, pacifist and feminist, you would expect South Riding to be something of a manifesto, with the novel's heroes representing the forces of progress and egalitarianism.In the hands of a lesser writer that's probably what you'd get. But to coin Virginia Woolf's description of Middlemarch, South Riding is a novel for grown-ups, not a pantomine with easily recognisable villains and heroes. Its characters are flawed individuals, struggling against the limitations of background and circumstance. It is to Holtby's credit that one of the novel's heroes is a man who stands for everything she fought against.South Riding has been described as a story of 'provincial life', which may suggest that its scope is narrow and its ambitions limited. But nothing could be further from the truth. This is, without a doubt, a truly great novel that has an enduring message about the human condition.This blog contains a much better review of South Riding than anything I could write, so if your appetite is even slightly whetted, please click on the link.I'll finish with a few quotes that I particularly liked:\"And who are you to think that you could get through life without pain? Did you expect never to be ashamed of yourself? Of course this hurts you. And it will go on hurting. You needn't believe what they say about time healing. I've had seventy years and more of time and there are plenty of things in my life still won't bear thinking. You've just got to get along as best you can with all your shames and sorrows and humiliations. Maybe in the end it's those things are most use to you.\"\"We're so busy resigning ourselves to the inevitable that we don't even ask if it is inevitable. We've got to have courage, to take our future into our hands. If the law is oppressive, we must change the law. If tradition is obstructive, we must break tradition. If the system is unjust, we must reform the system.\"\"I'm an old woman. But when you're seventy you don't always feel old. I know I don't. There are times when you find yourself thinking of yourself as a girl. 'Now the girl went downstairs.' 'Now the girl put her hat on.' And then you look in the glass and there's a stiff heavy lump of an elderly person facing you, your face all wrinkles and the life gone out of your limbs. But you can still feel young.\"The latest Virago edition has an introduction from Shirley Williams, whose mother - Vera Brittain - was Holtby's best friend. Sadly, the jacket design portrays a very different Yorkshire to the flat wolds that make up the landscape of South Riding:The two television adapatations were filmed 37 years apart. One is a 13-part ITV series by Stan Barstow, filmed in 1974. The other is a three-part BBC mini-series from last year. Comparing clips of the two, the 2011 version looks stunning, but probably only bears a passing resemblance to Holby's novel, whereas Barstow's adaptation appears to be pretty faithful to the original narrative, so there's no competition.It's a great pity that screen adaptations of classics have become such vapid affairs in recent years - beautiful to look at, but hacked to death until the result looks like a trailer.But that is a subject for another blog post. I think the last word should go to the wonderful Winifred Holtby:“These are the moments of revelation which compensate for the chaos, the discomfort, the toil of living. The crown of life is neither happiness nor annihilation: it is understanding. The artist’s intuitive vision; the thinker’s slow, laborious approach to truth, climbing through the alphabet of A, B, C, D, up to R, on the long way to Z; the knowledge that comes to the raw girl, to the unawakened woman—this is life; this is love. These are the moments in which all the disorder of life assumes a  pattern; we see; we understand; and immediately the intolerable burden becomes tolerable; we stand for a moment on the slopes of that great mountain from the summit of which we can see truth, and thus ‘enjoy the greatest felicity of which we are capable.’"},
{"title": "The Dignity of Labour", "date": "Saturday, October 20, 2012", "text": "When I left high street bookselling, I swore that I'd never work on a Saturday again. But that was before I ended up here:Even on a grey, misty morning, the drive to my cow shed always cheers me up. The fields appear still and empty, but the surrounding hedgerows are full of life and as I approach, rabbits, squirrels and pheasants run for cover, whilst hopeful sparrowhawks hover above. So far I haven't hit any animals, but a man in Spandex cycle shorts almost came a cropper.The cow shed may be rather spartan, but it is in a beautiful, quiet place, run by an old Sussex 'gentleman farmer', whose family have been there for generations. After years of working in awful places like Slough and Crawley, it seems too good to be true.I could quite happily stay there forever, but sadly I'm about to leave and move here:This is a very different sort of farm - one where sullen, limbless people glare at visitors and the ground is littered with dead rats, whilst semi-erect dogs bark half-heartedly. I'm not joking about the limbs, by the way. I saw four people today and only two of them were in full possession of their extremities. I shall steer clear of any farm machinery while I'm here.Why am I swapping my rural idyll for this post-apocalyptic settlement, you may ask? The answer is simple: money. The new barn is relatively cheap, with enough space to allow the business to expand significantly. It also has doors that are big enough to take lorries, so deliveries and waste collections will no longer involve an absurd, albeit scenic, time-wasting drive around the lanes of East Sussex.The one downside of a large space is that it will be impossible to heat, so I have spent most of today building a garden shed-cum-office with a carpenter from Brighton:I'd been a little apprehensive about spending a whole day making something with a complete stranger, but I needn't have been. The carpenter from Brighton was a true gentleman and when the time came to say goodbye, I felt a genuine pang of regret.As we chatted, he told me that he'd left school at 16 and joined his father's business in the building trade. He loved the work, but hated the environment: \"You know, there's only so long that you can work with racist, homophobic Sun readers.\" He has now set up a silk screen printing business, but still does a bit of carpentry on the side. I wish him well.The shed may not be the height of luxury, but it will be warm and I'm sure that with a little effort, I can imbue it with the opulence of an Ottoman palace.It took six hours to build the shed, which was quite long enough for me - I'm not a huge fan of manual labour. When I returned home, my reward was reading the Guardian Weekend magazine in a very deep, hot bath.I will miss the old farm, with its chocolate box scene of lush green fields and rolling hills in the distance. The new farm is muddy, smelly and unfriendly, but offers me the chance to make hay while the sun is still shining, if you'll forgive the crass metaphor. I've no idea what will happen to the book trade during the next few years, but I have to assume the worst.In the meantime, I have found a new rural idyll:While I'm hanging around, waiting for my son to finish his hour of 'farm therapy', I get to brush the mud out of a pony called Lucy. She seems to enjoy it and I'm picking up a useful skill for the post-apocalyptic society that will begin in 2017.Everyone's a winner."},
{"title": "More Random Photos Found in Books", "date": "Tuesday, October 16, 2012", "text": "I almost avoided using the r-word in the title of the post, as it has been hijacked by teenage girls - \"That's like, so random\" (with the annoying questioning intonation at the end) - but 'miscellaneous' sounds a little too cosy, as if I should be sitting next to a roaring log fire, sucking a Werther's Original. Today's selection consists of five photographs, in chronological order, and a postcard.We begin with a family portrait taken, I presume, during the First World War. The young sailor looks a little more cheerful than his poor brother - and with good reason. The number of casualties in the Royal Navy between 1914 to 1918 was 35,000. In the British Army, almost a million lives were lost. As a father of two sons, I can't begin to imagine what the parents ofservicemen went through during World War One. I know that in my own family, the death of a young man in the Battle of Loos affected three generations of people for decades after. Indeed, my grandmother never really recovered and even as late as the 1970s, still clung on to the belief that her brother had survived, but lost his memory.I wonder whether both of the young men in the photograph survived.Next, a photo of a man who looks as if he was named Len: This picture is from the days when men still wore ties in the workshop and had a decent selection of pencils in their top pocket. Len probably subscribed to the 'Valves Yearbook' and certainly knew his oscillators from his cavity resonators. The invention of the printed circuit has taken all the fun out of electronics, in the same way that the synthesizer ruined the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. A microchip is no substitute for a roomful of glowing valves, overheating diodes and magnetron tubes.  The 1970s, when children could still cycle around suburban streets with only a 23% chance of getting knocked down by a passing motorist. Drivers were still 'motorists' then, as if they possessed a professional skill like a chemist or dentist. If you were a driver, you were probably sitting behind the wheel of a van or lorry. A grainy 1978 study, next to an unusual window. The back of the photo doesn't give any clues. Is the younger man Sebastian Faulks?It would be so easy to write something about this photo, but I will refrain, except to say that I'm sure that he was the apple of his mother's eye.Finally, can anyone guess which part of London this postcard shows? Obviously it's a trick question. It's not London, it's Tehran. I had no idea that they had Routemaster buses, but a quick check on Google confirms that they used to be a 'main feature' of the city's public transport system. The other side of the card contains some nice stamps of the Shah and a mention of the 'appetising' food.  Fingers crossed for Iran that Mitt Romney doesn't get elected. In fact, fingers crossed for all of us that Mitt Romney doesn't get elected. Was that too random?"},

{"title": "The Tooth Will Out", "date": "Sunday, October 14, 2012", "text": "I was sitting in the dentist's chair yesterday, about to have a new crown fitted - the old one was gold and made me look like a James Bond villain. I'd been assured that the old crown was too far back for anyone to see it, but every Christmas photograph showed me smiling like a pimp and I was getting fed-up with having to airbrush the offending molar out in Photoshop. It was time for a change.Tap, tap, tap. \"How does the tooth feel?\" It hurt. Surely there shouldn't be any pain at all if the nerve had been removed? The dentist explained that some root canal fillings fail, but she knew a man who could probably fix it for £600.£600 seemed a lot of money to spend on a tooth that occasionally hurt a little, but then I found myself making the following calculations:If I die at the same age as my father, then I'll live for roughly another 12,000 days. £600 divided between 12,000 is around 5p a day. Would I spend 5p a day to avoid suffering from dental pain whenever I ate? Yes, absolutely. Suddenly it all seemed very clear and I tried to explain my reasoning to the dentist, but as soon as I alluded to any intimations of mortality, I knew I'd gone too far. I might think about my death every day, from the basic questions of when and how, to the more trivial ones like how many novels I'll read before I die, but my dentist just needed a simple yes or no. Spending money on dentistry is as rewarding as repairing a gutter, but the alternative is too horrible to contemplate. By the time they were 40, both of my parents had dentures, which foamed at night in pink and blue plastic containers on their bedside tables. Without their teeth, they looked like figures from a nightmare.As a child, I was given the impression that the same fate awaited me. My mother certainly did everything she could, albeit unwittingly, to ensure that I followed the same path. Every bedtime I was given a glass of orange squash, which I sipped through the night, bombarding my teeth with a relentless assault of sucrose.During the day, sweets were added to the mix: Trebor Mints, sherbert lemons, fruit salad chews, Spangles, Refreshers and the original Curly Wurly, which could remove a filling quicker than a Harley Street dentist:If we were travelling anywhere by train, I could also expect to be treated to a bar of Dairy Crunch, if the Nestle vending machine didn't swallow my 5p. My teeth didn't stand a chance.By the age of seven, I was already being given fillings. An unscrupulous dentist called Mr Maclean claimed a small fortune from the NHS by filling milk teeth that were about to fall out. To add injury to insult, he didn't bother giving me any injections. It was like being in Marathon Man.I bore the pain with a stoicism that my sons regrettably lack and my reward for bravery was a record of this:Filmed in Teddington in winter, it was probably the last time I found Benny Hill funny.I often wonder why my mother was (and still is) determined to give me as much sugar as possible. Was it the wartime rationing that gave her generation an obsession with toffees and biscuits, or simply the novelty of being able to afford things that were once rare treats?By the age of 20, most of my teeth had fillings and during the last 25 years, I've felt like a late Byzantine emperor, fighting a futile war of attrition against an increasingly powerful enemy. But all hope is not lost. According to the dentist, my gums are in reasonably good shape and none of the teeth have quite reached the point of no return.The foaming denture containers will have to wait.I will finish with this piece of popular verse, which will be familiar to most readers in the UK, Australia and New Zealand, but probably unknown to anyone else.

{"title": "Nature and Nurture", "date": "Saturday, October 06, 2012", "text": "My oldest son turned 13 today - an occasion that would probably inspire mixed emotions in most parents. In my son's case it's all a little more complicated. His refusal to go to school or travel beyond the environs of Lewes makes me wonder how he is going to negotiate his way through the teen years and emerge as an employable, datable adult.When I look at photos of the small, wrinkled creature whose whole hand was half the length of my index finger, it's sometimes hard not to wonder if we could have pursued a course that would have guaranteed a different outcome. But then I remember everything my wife did: becoming a full-time mother, buying organic food we couldn't afford, organising play dates and constantly reading to my son. She was jokingly nicknamed the 'perfect mother'.Perhaps the one thing that could have made a difference was if we'd got a diagnosis six years earlier, rather than being labelled by some psychologists as the ineffectual parents of a badly behaved boy (on one occasion, a rather strange German woman, who wore an absurdly revealing top, turned to us and said \"Why do you want to medicalise your child? Hiss behaviour is just simple sibling rivalry\").In the face of 'expert opinion', we meekly acquiesced. Perhaps we were just neurotic, middle class parents, over-intellectualising problems that were simply the result of poor parenting. It took many years and a lot of suffering on our son's part before we met a psychiatrist who changed everything.I feel rather anxious about the next few years, but there are plenty of positives too. My son is a bright, quirky individual with a good sense of humour and a strong moral sense (when his classmates started using 'gay' as a term of abuse, he not only refused to join in, but openly challenged anyone that said it). He will never be part of the crowd and that's no bad thing, but isolation can be debilitating.As he grows older, my son should find more people like himself and has the potential to lead a fulfilling life, if he can just find his niche. His main challenge is to find a way of functioning in the world of neurotypicals who won't understand why he doesn't want to go on the staff trip to Thorpe Park or attend a two-day seminar in Telford.In the meantime, we're trying to fill his life with calming, fulfilling activities that will also get him away from the Xbox. That latest idea is 'farm therapy':The concept is simple enough. You go to a farm, groom the animals, feed them and do a few odd jobs. It's basic farming, but without the stress of crippling debts, EU quotas and bullying supermarket executives. It's supposed to be very effective for children with severe anxiety.It's also very good for adults too. As I brushed the mud off a pony, I felt myself experiencing flow and left feeling more physically and mentally relaxed than I had been for a long time. Why should brushing mud off an animal be so rewarding?On reflection, I liked the way the pony became very still and seemed to enjoy the brush strokes. I also enjoyed the repetition of the action and the way the coat became increasingly silky as the dirt was brushed out. When it was time to groom the pigs, the snorting and probing snouts added an element of humour too.The farm was only a mile away, but it felt like another world, far removed from the nonsense of marketing meetings, public relations and rebranding exercises. I'm not sure if my son wants to go back, but if he doesn't I'll go on my own.Finally, on the theme of nature, I went for a walk up on the Downs today and found something unusual in this puddle: It was easy to miss. Barely thicker than a blade of grass and just under an inch long, this baby newt stopped next to a piece of string:Judging by the recent weather, there seems little danger of the pond drying up, so I only hope that it survives the steady traffic of horses hooves and hiking boots, not to mention the adders.I was going to say something along the lines of the best things in life being free, but apparently the farm therapy isn't, so I'll have to think of another platitude."},

I'd love to think that beneath his amiable exterior, the Rev. Awdry hid a dark, shameful secret, flinching at the mere mention of Ursula Hourihane's name. On the other hand, it would also be fun to portray the elderly Miss Irene Mabel Cloke as a shameless plagiarist, who lived in fear of being exposed as the Railway books became increasingly popular. Sadly, the truth is probably a lot duller."},
{"title": "Carpe Diem", "date": "Saturday, September 29, 2012", "text": "It is exactly a year since I left my last job. Like some politicians, I resigned to 'spend more time with my family'. My elderly mother had just moved to Lewes and my oldest son was struggling with a debilitating condition that prevented him from attending school, so I wanted to be near them.However that wasn't the whole story. I also think I'd reached a crisis point where, in my mid-40s, I was no longer willing to tolerate the frustrations of working for other people. Ironically, it was probably the most successful job I'd had and I enjoyed a good relationship with my employers. But I felt ground down by the nine-to-five routine, the 25-mile commute and the grim environment - an open plan office on a drab industrial estate.Although there was little danger of me regretting my decision, I made this short film to remind me why I'd left:One year on, I feel as if I have become myself again for the first time in 25 years. It is as if I have been been deprogrammed after belonging to a rather unpleasant religious cult.Some people find security in the routine of working so many hours a day, for so many days a week, for so many weeks a year, but I couldn't stand it and felt as if the best years of my life were ebbing away. I had watched my father endure years of hard work and a tortuous commute, only to succumb to heart disease within months of retirement. I wasn't willing to follow the same path.The last year has been difficult. I have been trying to negotiate the thin line between self-employment and unemployment - time versus money - but I think I've cracked it. In a few weeks I will be starting a new project which should, hopefully, provide the financial security I need to deal with the challenges that lie ahead.That's Plan A. There is no Plan B, so I'd better make sure that I get it right."},

{"title": "A Day Out", "date": "Sunday, September 23, 2012", "text": "Whenever I go to zoos, I always see at least one young couple carrying a bemused-looking two-month-old baby. \"Look at the elephant Poppy!\" the father exclaims in the high-pitched voice of a children's television presenter. Poppy looks on impassively. For her, the large grey thing that she will later discover is an elephant is no more notable than the large brown thing that is a gift shop.I did exactly the same thing with my first child. It was ridiculous, but I was so excited at the prospect of being able to take him on days out I couldn't wait. I probably wasted a lot of money on trips that my son has no memory of. With my second son, I have had the good sense to ration museum excursions and lower my expectations of the visit.Yesterday I took my younger son to the Imperial War Museum. Normally, the word museum doesn't provoke a terribly positive reaction in my children, so I carefully said that we were going to the *mumble* Imperial *speak up* WAR *mumble again* Museum. My son look thoughtfully and replied \"Cool\".I wish he wouldn't say that.I like travelling to London on a Saturday. During the weekdays the trains are packed full of weary-looking people that hate their jobs, self-important businessmen who think the carriage is an extension of their office and lumbering NVQ students on their way to Crawley, with headphones pumping out cicada-like rhythms. On Saturday everyone's in a good mood.The train arrives on time and to my relief, it is 12 carriages long. Occasionally, for reasons unknown, the train only has four carriages and an unseemly scramble ensues. It's quite amusing watching well-to-do people desperately running down a platform, trying to maintain their dignity. I wonder how we will pass the one-hour journey. Sometimes my son is extremely garrulous, bombarding me with questions like \"Dad, how many bullets would it take to kill a stegosaurus?\" Today he is silent, possibly overawed by the experience of being on a train, so I'm able to eavesdrop on other people's conversations:\"I say she should be able to do whatever she likes, but she can't go around wearin' a bodice all day. I mean, it's not the Victorian age.\" I look behind me and see two men in their late 20s. I was hoping to hear more, but they are drowned out by a recorded annoucement.To my left, a man in his 60s is holding court to some people who don't seem to know him very well:\"Well I love looking at the boats in the harbour and seeing what the people are doing and if that makes me a peeping tom, then yes, I suppose I am. But they don't kow anyone's looking at them so there's no harm in it. I think people are fascinating. As you get older, you can get a bit cut-off being in the country. I'd quite happily live in the centre of Lewes, right on the High Street where I could watch everything going on, but Sheila says she'd miss having a front garden.\"I am distracted by the trolley service. I don't know why, but having a tea or coffee on a train always feels like such a treat, I'll even buy one when I don't really want a drink. Like every other trolley attendant on this line, the young man who serves me is Eastern European. A few years ago, there used to be a man in his 70s who must have been one of the last people to have a real Sussex accent: \"Tay, cahfee, beerrr...\"The man on my left is still talking:It's an investment. They won't build any more like that. Last Sunday I was sitting in the conservatory, watching the thunder storm. It was the most spectacular storm I've ever seen. I saw three forks of lightning dancing along the top of the Downs...\"We arrive at Wivelsfield. The name always makes think of an obsequious, Uriah Heep-style character in a Dickens novel. No-one ever gets off at Wivelsfield.The rest of the journey is uneventful so I read the Guardian magazine, which has an interesting interview with JK Rowling about her new novel for adults. I was one of the early supporters of Harry Potter, but grew disillutioned when it became a franchise. By the time of the fifth book, I was so sickened by the hype and the obligation to dress up as a wizard at midnight, I decided to liven things up with some real snakes and venomous spiders. That was a memorable book launch.We stop at Gatwick,  where two men with beards, backpacks and flip flops board the train. One of them sits next to me and leans right into my body space. I glare and he shuffles away. Welcome to Britain. At Clapham Junction we change trains. I tell my son to look out for Big Ben, but the skyline has changed and we can't see a thing. Waterloo is packed and I compare the station with a 1979 photo I posted recently, which shows a greyer, grimmer, half-empty concourse. We take an escalator to the Bakerloo line, where the tunnels are reassuringly shabby, and travel one stop to Lambeth.The walk from Lambeth North to the Imperial War Museum is unremarkable, but I have a pleasant surprise:  I'm particularly pleased to stumble upon this house, as my sole contribution to my older son's home education at the moment is to study the mutiny on the HMS Bounty. We've already watched the 1935 Hollywood film with Charles Lawton. Next, we'll tackle the 1984 version with Anthony Hopkins and Mel Gibson. Apart from teaching my son a little history and geography, I hope that it will get him thinking critically about the reliability of the narrative in historical films. Was Captain Bligh the sadistic brute of popular myth? With a screenplay by Rober Bolt, the 1984 film should be more balanced. If only they hadn't asked Vangelis to write the music.The Imperial War Museum is a big hit, but my attempts to emphasise the pity of war fall on deaf ears: \"Those guns are big! Could they destroy a whole house? Cool!\"On the way back to the tube station, I am subjected a stream of questions: \"Who was on our side? France? But I thought they were our enemy. Why did they lose to the Germans? Was Spain on our side? Why not? Was Africa on our side? What weapons did they have?\" We finish the day at the London Eye, where there are the usual people pretending to be statues of Michael Jackson. \"Who's that?\" my son I asks. I explain that it's a real person standing very still, dressed as Michael Jackson. \"Who's Michael Jackson?\"What a difference three years makes."},
{"title": "There and Back Again", "date": "Thursday, September 20, 2012", "text": "Yesterday I had to make a 200-mile round trip for a meeting that only lasted for a few minutes. It went well enough, but I wonder if, in the age of the internet, a couple of emails wouldn't have covered the following exchange:Person: Is this the sort of thing you want? Me: Yes.Person: Good. Still, I suppose it is important to meet people face to face, shake hands and establish contact. I also quite like the opportunity to get out of the house and visit places I haven't been to, even if most of them seem to look exactly the same.After planning my route, I realised that I'd be passing Aldbury - a village I'd wanted to visit ever since I watched this (try 1:16 to 3:20):In this episode, Murdersville, Aldbury appears as 'Little Sworping In-the-Swuff' a wonderful name that is only slightly more absurd that those of many real villages I can think of. Was Aldbury as idyllic as it seemed and if it was, how much had it changed in the 45 years since that episode was filmed? Would I be like George Bowling in Coming Up For Air, searching for a land of lost content, only to find that it had been ruined beyond all recognition?Fortunately, Aldbury seemed to be completely unaffected by the march of progress:The centre of Aldbury is dominated by pre-19th century buildings, including several Tudor houses with thatched roofs. It's a picture postcard village, almost too perfect, as if it has been constructed for a film set. Unsurprisingly, Aldbury has appeared in 'Midsomer Murders'.These stocks are next to the village pond, where Mrs Peel was subjected to waterboarding. Even today, it's quite a shocking scene and I pity her poor stunt double. Up on the hill, there's a rather interesting looking building. I know that someone who grew up in Aldbury occasionally visits this blog, so I hope they might be able to shed some light on this mystery:Almost every house I passed had something unique and eye-catching. I particularly liked this chimney, which seemed a little ostentatious for a small cottage:This building below is the local primary school. Again, it's an unusual, quirky building, full of character. I'd spent the previous hour driving through bland estates of cheap, badly-designed modern housing, so it was a relief to visit somewhere that hadn't been ruined by commerce and short-sighted pragmatism. But as villages and towns like Aldbury and Lewes become increasingly desirable to those of us who aren't completely enamoured with the modern world, the disparity in house prices becomes increasingly polarised.When I saw one man waxing one of three 1960s MGs in his drive, I wondered how many of Aldbury's current inhabitants were born there.On the way home, I listened to a podcast of an interview with Salman Rushdie and was delighted to discover to during his time in advertising he was responsible for this:"},
{"title": "George Gissing - Our Friend the Charlatan", "date": "Tuesday, September 18, 2012", "text": "I thought I was reasonably well-informed about George Gissing, but last week I downloaded 18 of his books onto my Kindle for a mere £1.29 and came across a novel I'd never heard of: Our Friend the Charlatan. Out of curiosity I looked at the first few pages and before long I was reading the whole thing, utterly gripped. Was this a scandalously neglected masterpiece or an enjoyable, escapist potboiler?Like Ingmar Bergman films and Tori Amos albums, you have to be in the right mood for Gissing. His bleak tales of poverty and thwarted ambition aren't for the faint-hearted and as with Hardy, it's sometimes hard to commit yourself to a narrative where the outcome seems predetermined from the first chapter.But I'd forgotten how funny Gissing can be, in spite of his übermiserabilist credentials . I'd also forgotten how good he was at capturing the mood of late Victorian Britain, outwardly comfortable and complacent, but inwardly racked with tensions over issues of sex, class and religion.With its gentle social satire and absence of grim melodrama, Our Friend the Charlatan sometimes feel more like an abridged Trollope novel in which the verbose digressions have been removed by a foward-thinking editor. Like so many Victorian stories, there is an elderly aristocrat, a young man on the make, a question of inheritance and a dilemma between marrying for love or money. But these familiar elements are merely a device for Gissing to create something where the sum is far greater than its parts.Dyce Lashmar, the improbably-named main character, is a young man whose Oxford education has given him ideas above his station. Blessed with no discernible gifts except an unwavering confidence in his own abilities, Lashmar is horrified when his two sources of income - an annuity from his improverished father and the tuition fees he earns from instructing the son of a young widow - suddenly come to an end.However, when the daughter of a former family friend tells Dyce that she is a secretary to a wealthy philanthropist, he sees an opportunity to cultivate a patron who will sponsor his glittering career.Like Vanity Fair, this is a novel without a hero and all of the main characters are highly flawed individuals, but none more so than Dyce Lashmar, whose ability to recycle the ideas of an obscure French book on sociobiology convinces others that he is a 'coming man': \"All I know is, Dyce, that you might be the coming man, and you're content to be nobody at all.\"    Dyce laughed.    \"The coming man! Well, perhaps, I am; who knows? At all events, it's something to know that you believe in me. And it may be that you are not the only one.\" A master of self-delusion, Lashmar soon believes that the Frenchman's ideas are merely a crude prototype for his own sophisticated philosophy and this genuine convinction successfully gains him a growing number of supporters. Only one person sees through him and their mischievous intervention adds tension to what could have been a rather plodding story.Dyce Lasmar is clearly a vehicle for Gissing to explore the growing frustrations of the emerging middle class at the ruling aristocracy:What, in deed, did such titles mean nowadays? They were a silly anachronism, absurdly in contradiction with that scientific teaching which rules our lives. Lashmar, of course, was right in his demand for a new aristocracy to oust the old, an aristocracy of nature, of the born leaders of men.In Our Friend the Charlatan, it is Darwin who has changed everything, not socialism. Even Dyce's father, an impoverished rector, agrees:The Rev. Philip was in his sixty-seventh year; a thin, dry, round-shouldered man, with bald occiput, straggling yellowish beard, and a face which recalled that of Darwin. The resemblance pleased him. Privately he accepted the theory of organic evolution, reconciling it with a very broad Anglicanism; in his public utterances he touched upon the Darwinian doctrine with a weary disdain. Later in the story, Gissing mentions that Lashmar and a friend have become interested in Nietzsche and in a passage that is remarkably prescient for a novel published in 1901, they discuss their reservations about his philosophy: \"He'll do a great deal of harm in the world,\" she said, this same afternoon, as Dyce and she drank tea together. \"The jingo impulse, and all sorts of forces making for animalism, will get strength from him, directly or indirectly. It's the negation of all we are working for, you and I.\"    \"Of course it is,\" Dyce replied, in a voice of conviction. \"We have to fight against him.\" He added, after a pause, \"There is a truth in him, of course; but it's one of those truths which are dangerous to the generality of men.\" Nietzsche's views are, of course, the symptom, not the cause and Gissing clearly feared certain aspects of the fin de siècle culture that was replacing the old order:Mrs. Toplady had always wished for the coming of the very hero, the man without fear, without qualm, who should put our finicking civilisation under his feet. Her god was a compound of the blood-reeking conqueror and the diplomatist supreme in guile. For such a man she would have poured out her safe-invested treasure, enough rewarded with a nod of half-disdainful recognition. It vexed her to think that she might pass away before the appearance of that new actor on the human stage; his entrance was all but due, she felt assured. Ah! the world would be much more amusing presently, and she meanwhile was growing old. Mrs Toplady, a woman in early middle age, would have probably lived long enough to see her wishes come true, albeit in a rather different guise. Gissing didn't even reach his 50th birthday.Gissing's novels about the lower middle classes, educated beyond their means, trapped in lives of genteel poverty on trifling annuities, will have resonances for many modern readers and their obscurity is ill-deserved.Today, only New Grub Street is widely read whilst others like The Nether World, In the Year of Jubilee and The Odd Women are merely admired. This is a great pity, as few writers have managed to create such a vivid panorama of late Victorian society. His descriptions of suburban London in In the Year of Jubilee are so well written that the sights and sounds almost become a false memory of something actually experienced.Perhaps Gissing would have attracted more readers if he'd emulated Hardy, moving his stories to a more attractive rural setting where he could begin each novel with a portentous topographical description of the local area. I'm glad he didn't.In Our Friend the Charlatan, the narrative is dominated by dialogue. This makes it very easy to read but suggests that this is a slight work, produced in a hurry. Some of the characters are a little two-dimensional and the Lady Bracknell figure feels all too familiar. However, I found it fascinating.Gissing's portrayal of the plight of someone of limited means whose ambition was inversely proportional to their talent, is extremely entertaining. But, more importantly, it provides an insight into a society that was hurtling towards civil unrest and world war. This novel does not deserve its current status as an obscure, linkless item on Wikipedia. I hope that in the age of the blogosphere, Gissing's time will come."},

Not only does it now take less time to scan an image than it does to make a cup of tea, but it also makes half-decent copies of slides and for the first time in years, I've been able to look at the photos I took as a child in the late 1970s.I don't think many schoolchildren were into slide photography in those days, but my father had access to a steady supply of slightly out of date films and in the void left after my all-consuming obsession with Marvel comics, I needed a new hobby.As luck would have it, my Auntie Nance died and left me the princely sum of £30. I used it to buy the latest Abba LP and a no-frills 35mm 'manual focus' camera. It was money well spent.Looking at the pictures over 30 years on, I have no idea why I took most of them. I can only assume that a trip to London was so exciting (despite living a mere ten miles away from Hyde Park Corner) that even the most mundane features warranted a photograph:At a glance, the Waterloo station of 1979 doesn't look radically different. In the background, you can just about see the brown and orange livery of WH Smith and the font on the signs seems to be the same, but you'd search in vain for a cappuccino or a pain au chocolat.However, if you think Waterloo station's boring, try this for size:High Street Kensington. From a modern perspective this photograph has a timeless dullness, but the advert for Silk Cut cigarettes clearly dates the image. It's also nice to see a poster for Pernod after my recent experience with a bemused barmaid.I haven't been to Earls Court for a long time, but I remember the blue signs with illuminated arrows that indicated where each train was going. During many a long wait for the Richmond line, I developed a deeply-rooted hatred for Ealing Broadway and Wimbledon, which seemed to have more than their fair share of trains.London seems more drab in these photos and if I remember correctly, parts of the Thames were lined with disused warehouses and gaps left by bomb sites. I wish that I'd had the sense to photograph that aspect of the city rather than waste film on shots of Big Ben and the Tower Bridge.Home: the dreaming suburb of Teddington, with street upon street of semi-detached Victorian houses. I never liked it that much and couldn't understand why Teddington became a property 'hotspot' until I started visiting other London suburbs. When you've been to Sidcup and Perivale (not to mention Ealing Broadway), Teddington suddenly looks very attractive.Twickenham riverside, taken from the bridge to the once famous Eel Pie Island, where the Rolling Stones used to play at the now defunct hotel. As a child I took this area, with its parks, stately homes and Georgian buildings, completely for granted, but by the time I bought my camera I was beginning to see it differently.The Richmond May Fair, 1979. Interestingly, I don't think it's the man in the bow tie that dates the  photo - you'll probably still see people like him wandering around  Richmond - but the woman on the left, with the long dress.I used to dread going to this fair because my parents invariably bumped into people they knew from their childhood and I would have to listen to one conversation after another. In the 1980s something changed - perhaps the advent of the Yuppie era - and it was as if the area had been ethnically cleansed. The last time I went to the fair with my parents, they didn't meet a single person they knew.When I tell people that I grew up in Richmond-upon-Thames, their reaction is usually something along the lines of \"Oooh, la-di-dah!\", but it was a normal place in those days. Like Hampstead, Richmond had more millionaires per square mile than most London suburbs, but there weren't many of them by the gasworks where my mother lived.In many ways I prefer the London of 2012, but I wish that the local communities hadn't been destroyed by the vagaries of the housing market. Today, Richmond feels soulless, almost like a gated community for the very wealthy.I went to school with over 1000 children, but could spend a week walking the streets of Richmond and Twickenham without bumping into anyone I know. Where did everyone go?In addition to photos of London and Richmond, I also found a few from trips to the west of England (including the picture at the top):This is a medieval barn in Bradford-upon-Avon, Wiltshire. It has an ingeniously-designed feature where, at a certain time of the day, the setting sun produces a golden cross on the floor. By sheer chance, I turned up at exactly the right moment:Further west, the photo below of Dartmoor makes it look even more desolate than I remember:For a cheap camera, manufactured in one of the lesser regimes of the east, these photos beat the Kodak Instamatic hands down. If only the pictures hadn't been quite so dull. Why did I take photographs of Brentford high street, mallard ducks in Bushy Park and a blurred shot of a train entering Twickenham station?Thank God there were no digital cameras in 1979. If I'd been let loose with 8GB of memory, then there's no telling how far I would have gone. Bus stops? Lamp posts? It makes me shudder to think of it."},

Outside, an ice cream van is playing Greensleeves to empty streets and my youngest son is recreating jungle warfare in our neglected garden. The house seems curiously barren since we handed Maisy the dog back to her owners.(Maisy's departure wasn't quite as straighforward as I'd anticipated. After a seemingly emotional reunion with her family, she ran away the following day and was discovered sitting on our doorstep. I can only assume that this and subsequent escapes were prompted by happy memories of long walks and Tesco's Finest dog food)It has been a sociable weekend. Yesterday I spent a very pleasant afternoon at the Coal Hole in the Strand with a couple of friends from university. We argued about Twitter, agreed about the Olympics opening ceremony and recalled a rather unpleasant encounter I had with a vicar who worked in a boys' home.We ended up in the Chandos where, to my horror, a young Australian barmaid had never heard of a Pernod and lemonade. I felt like a man who had been released from prison after a very long stretch.I felt slightly fragile this morning, but when a friend reminded me that this was the weekend for the wonderful Heritage Open Days scheme, we decided to visit St Michael's Church in Lewes:On the outside, St Michael's is a pleasant but fairly unremarkable medieval church, right next to a main road. However, it contains one of Lewes's hidden gems: a beautiful walled graveyard, tucked away between the Castle and some old houses:If ever I feel the need to get away from everything and enjoy an hour's solitude, then I come here. The bustling high street is only yards away, but there is an eerie quietness that evokes an older world and spiders' webs lie undisturbed.Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,  Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,  Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,  The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.With Lewes Castle towering over the churchyard, you can enjoy the same  view that Thomas Paine and his bride had, when they married here in  1771. I wonder how much this view of St Michael's, from the top of the Castle, has changed in 241 years? I'd like to think that Thomas Paine would find 21st century Lewes reasonably familiar:"},

There is a rather melancholy aspect to acquiring books that have become available as a result of death or senile dementia, but at least they are being saved from ending up on a landfill site.Over 90% of the stock is disappointing: book club editions, out of date encyclopaedias and bestsellers by unfashionable authors like Howard Spring, Frank Yerby, Naomi Jacob and Frances Parkinson Keyes, but the remaining titles can produce a modest profit if you know what you're doing.Occasionally I acquire 'private collections' that I'm sure their owners would have destroyed if they hadn't been caught short by an unexpected misfortune. I certainly won't forget the photograph album I discovered (I was going  to write 'came across', but decided against it) which began with shots of a reasonably attractive blonde  woman in saucy lingerie, but gradually revealed that she was more of a  man than I'll ever be.It won't be like this forever. These days, the darker recesses of the human psyche can be sated in the privacy of cyberspace, so the day will come when house clearances no longer reveal as much about people's hidden fantasies. Also, their books, photo albums and music collections will be conveniently stored in an object no bigger than a coin.But in the meantime, there are plenty of gems. Today, I found a collection of magazines tucked away at the bottom of a box. This was my favourite:Published in New York in October 1968, Man's Story is an absurd collection of short stories, salacious tabloid journalism and saucy photoshoots.Judging by the many adverts for hairpieces and cures for baldness, I'd guess that the magazine was aimed at middle-aged men who had missed out on the sexual revolution and wanted a piece of the action:THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION AND ITS IMPACT ON YOU.This is the era of the swinger when anything goes and no holds barred. Yet it can become the time of your greatest frustrations as it has for many.\"I've done eveything they suggest in the Kama Sutra and then some. There's no possibility of committing the act that I haven't tried. And that goes for all the exotic buildups too. Frankly, sex is getting to be a nothing with me.\" The speaker is a 20-year-old coed whom we'll call Connie.19 pages on, another article asks: \"Is sex dead? Before you laugh at the thought, listen to what the experts are saying. You may be in for some startling surprises.\"By now, you don't know whether you're coming or going, but luckily there are plenty of helpful products to help you negotiate your way through the late 1960s sexual minefield.Let's begin with the hair:Perfect. Those groovy chicks will dig your hair, but if you're not convinced that $20 will be enough to maintain the illusion of youth, there are more expensive alternatives:I think I'll go for the Seville, but although my hair now looks great, there's not much I can do about my appalling physique, or is there?The Charles Atlas adverts were a staple of American magazines and comics long after this edition of Man's Story was published. Even as a boy, I hated this advert when I saw it in the imported Marvel comics that I was addicted to. For me, the 'weedy' man's transformation into someone like my PE teacher was a betrayal.However, if you have managed to develop the perfect physique, you'll need a racier range of underwear:Now that you've transformed yourself from a balding, flabby middle-aged man into a 60s swinger, you can join the sexual revolution:But how will you afford all of this sex? Fortunately, Man's Story is packed full of useful career advice:I'm not convinced that those swinging chicks would be attracted to a man who'd just spent the day cutting up dead animals. Surely it would be better to go for something like this:Sorry, no dames. Judging by this advert, in addition to a generous salary and a new car, you are also encouraged to have sex with victims of car accidents. Perhaps you might even meet someone like Collette Berne:There are several photoshoots of 'aspiring actresses' who, posterity now tells us, continued to aspire.As for the stories, they are surprisingly literary in tone - obviously the work of frustrated authors. To compensate for their dullness, the magazine's editors have added sensationalist bylines:Through the vice-ridden cess pool of Oran, I clawed my way to the sinister abode on Rue de l'Aqueduc where the diabolical auctioneer dealt in lovely sex slaves and hideous slaughter...But the best has to be the Nazi biker story on the front cover:\"WE'LL TAKE YOUR CHICK THE HARD WAY, PUNK!You owe us something, Narko. And doll face here is your first payment.\" The way they looked at Arlene told me just how high their price would be.However, beyond the humorous aspect of these magazines, the portrayal of women and the casual link between sex and violence makes me feel quesy:When I was at university in the 1980s, the pendulum had swung so far in the other direction that it sometimes felt as if we were living in a theocratic state, where even the most innocuous remarks could be branded as sexist and offensive. But after reading these magazines, I can see exactly why the reaction was so strong.Ten years on, the pendulum had swung back again, but this time the sexism was 'postmodern' and 'ironic'. I don't think magazines like Loaded and Nuts have been our finest hour, but at least they didn't contain the awful sensationalist violence of their predecessors.The one thing I really like about American magazines of the 60s and 70s is the adverts. You couldn't have got away with this in spoilsport Britain:"},
{"title": "In Chains", "date": "Tuesday, August 28, 2012", "text": "It's now over a year since my mother moved to Lewes and she's settled  down very well, but the one thing she doesn't like is the shops: \"They don't have anywhere where I can buy nice blouses in my size\".By nice,  my mother means the sorts of clothes that faintly resemble the staff  uniforms of building society employees in the early 90s: pastel,  understated floral patterns in washing machine-friendly artificial  fibres.As for size, Lewes is not fat town. Nationally, 66% of  men of my age and height are heavier than me, but in Lewes I feel like a  pasty-eating slob compared to the gaunt, earnest-looking men with  beards who think nothing of starting the day with a 20-mile cycle ride. I should  move to Walsall.We needed to go further afield. I asked  my mother if she'd like to try Eastbourne, a coastal resort with the  highest number of people over 80 in the UK. Without pausing for thought,  she replied \"Not 'arf!\"As  I parked the car at Lewes railway station, my mother remarked that this  would be the first time that she'd been on a train in 30 years. I found  it hard to believe, but her look of wonder as we boarded the  air-conditioned carriage was genuine.Suddenly, my mother looked worried: \"But we can't sit here. This is 1st class isn't it?\".  I assured her that it wasn't and that the rail network had changed a  lot since the days when scuffy men in donkey jackets half-heartedly  ambled along the platform with a broom in one hand and a cigarette in  the other. \"Cor!\" my mother replied, \"It's posh isn't it!\"For me, it was an unremarkable train journey. For my mother, it was time travel.Many  aspects of the service industries have improved during the last three  decades. This is obviously a 'good thing', but during my visit to  Eastbourne's rather depressing Arndale Centre, I was reminded of the  darker side of this cultural shift by a huge poster advertising  'exciting' job opportunities in a new branch of River Island.Since  when was working in a clothes shop exciting? You put clothes on  display, tidy up the mess that customers have made and occasionally  operate the till. It might be enjoyable if you like the work and get on  with your colleagues, but surely the job's pretty low on thrills apart  from the odd spat with a shoplifter.Sadly, the River Island  advert is symptomatic of a growing trend in which retailers want their  employees souls as well as their bodies. You can work as hard as you  like, but if you're not excited about the brand, you're not being part of the team. It's an employers' market.When I joined the Ottakar's bookshop chain in the mid-90s, there was no nonsense about having to be excited.  The senior managment used to motivate staff by giving them a lot of  autonomy and rewarding success with generous bonuses. It worked. Staff  were generally enthusiastic and, sometimes, even excited, but we didn't  start grinning inanely at every customer who walked in the door.However in today's economic climate, bonuses are thin on the ground and the main motivational tool is fear: \"Work  hard, look as if you're really enjoying yourself and you might get to  keep your job, but don't think you can fool us. If you're in a shop,  leisure centre or museum, we have mystery customers. If you're in a call  centre we will be listening to you. As for the drivers, we're tracking  you all the way. Any unscheduled stops will be monitored. No-one is  beyond our reach\"I'm very pleased that service has  improved since the days when many shop assistants talked amongst themselves and treated customers like an inconvenience, but the growing trend of subjecting poorly-paid employees to  an Orwellian regime of constant surveillance and 'thought police' who  look for any signs of dissent disturbs me deeply.In some cases,  the result isn't even good service, but manic, rather desperate and  intrusive behaviour that is deeply off-putting. When I walk in a clothes  shop I want to be left alone, not befriended by an insincere assistant  who is clearly terrified that I might be a mystery shopper, beaming at  me every time I glance in their direction. Also, I'd like to be able to just buy something without any nonsense about bars of chocolate, loyalty cards, mobile phone top-ups and stamps.During my last few  months at Waterstone's, we were encouraged to get 'added value' from  purchases by asking customers if there was anything else they wanted  and, if there wasn't, would they be interested in buying \"this £12 book on wine for £5? No? Well how about joining our loyalty card scheme...\"Some  people responded, but most looked embarrassed or irritated and couldn't  get out of the shop quickly enough. We were able to measure how many  customers joined the loyalty card scheme, but not how many were put off  by this approach. I hated it and knew that it was time to leave.High street retailers are trying to save themselves by squeezing as much money as possible out of their diminishing pool of customers, but their methods are simply driving people like me towards the hassle-free environment of the internet. Sadly, they usually can't give their customers the thing they really want: value.Back in the Arndale Centre I rejoined my mother, who was in Bon Marche,  buying a coat that looked as if it would repel a chemical warfare  attack. The shop assistant was desperately trying to sign my mother up  to a new loyalty card scheme, but something wasn't working properly and I  sensed a growing desperation. \"I'm really sorry madam. I'll just try one more time...\"As we left the shop, my mother turned to me and said \"That poor woman. I don't suppose I'll ever use this thing.\""},

{"title": "Dog Tired", "date": "Thursday, August 23, 2012", "text": "When  my wife announced that we would be looking after a dog for five weeks,  she tried to sweeten the news by promising that my involvement would be  limited to the occasional stroll around the block. Like a fool I  reluctantly agreed.However things didn't quite turn out as I'd  hoped. News travelled around the Lewes grapevine that there was a family  who looked after dogs for free and before long we were joined by a  second terrier - a neurotic Jack Russell that would only sleep with  humans. I wasn't happy, but decided to try and put a brave face on  things.Then my wife developed pneumonia and I suddenly found  myself in charge of a household of feral children and incontinent dogs.  At this point something snapped.I didn't mind the cooking and cleaning. I'd even resigned myself to the long walks and the dog poo. But after a day of being an überfather,  I felt that I'd earned the right to a decent night's sleep. Sadly,  Poppy the Jack Russell had other ideas, howling, barking and scratching  at doors as soon as it was bedtime.After two sleepless nights I  felt a deep, primordial rage at Poppy. When, just before lunchtime,  Poppy and I were alone in the dining room, I decided to vent my  frustrations:\"Look, you ******* ****, we  don't even want you  here. You're a ******* ***** ** *** **** and I can't wait until you go.  I never want to see you again, you ******* annoying, neurotic canine  ****\"The rant was cathartic and Poppy was blissfully oblivious to my sentiments. It was a win-win situation.Then the door swung open and my oldest son walked up to his laptop:\"Hi! Are you still there?\"\"Yeah. I've just been crafting an obsidian sword...\"At  this point, I realised my son was in the middle of a Skype conversation  and that my expletive-ridden diatribe against Poppy had been relayed to  her owners in Scotland. Apparently the whole family were sitting around  a table, listening to my obscenities.It wasn't my finest moment, but on the plus side I don't think we'll have to worry about looking after Poppy again.Maisy  the border terrier will be with us for another week and although I  can't say I've ever got used to the constant smell of overcooked peas, I  will miss her when she's gone. She has, without exaggeration,  transformed our lives and my older son seems happier than he has been  for a long time. For that reason alone, I'm prepared to endure the  grimmer aspects of dog ownership.I know several people who say  that owning a dog is almost like having a child. I always agree with  them because I don't want to shatter their illusions, but I'm afraid  that owning a dog is nothing like having a child.If only  children were content to sit in a basket for hours, occasionally  requesting a brief tummy tickle or a walk around the block.A  month ago, my oldest son was the only dog lover in the house. My wife  was indifferent, I was hostile and our youngest son was terrified. In  the space of four weeks, Maisy has won us all over. When I tried to  explain to our six-year-old that he needed to wash his hands because  Maisy was a magnet for bugs, he was indignant: \"No she isn't! She's a  magnet for love\".Before  they left for their five-week holiday in France, Maisy's owners said  that they were going to arrange for her to have puppies in the autumn. With any luck, a mini-Maisy will be with us by Christmas."},

HOME-MADE MUSIC\"Ever had a strong desire to make music, with no musical instruments to hand? Robert and Terry had just that desire the other day...\"2. MAKING A COLOURED WOOLLEN BALL3. BLOW FOOTBALL\"When it's raining outside and you are just longing for a game with a ball, why not try making a blow football game\"4. A PAPER TREE5. THE NOSEY MATCH-BOX\"Here is a good way of starting up some party fun. It is just the sort of game to get everyone laughing\"6. A GYPSY GIRL6. THE \"GUESS WHO\" GAME7. HAND PUPPETS\"You will find it great fun painting faces on the palms of your hands\"8. THE SHEIK OF ARABY9. PAPER SCREECHER\"Most boys like to make a noise occasionally, and Robert is no exception\"10. THE BOOK RACE\"Not one of the fastest games for a party or family gathering, but certainly one of the funniest is the 'book race'\"I was born too late to enjoy most of these pleasures, although I do have a memory of my father trying to organise a game of blow football on my 8th birthday party. I was so embarrassed, I wouldn't talk to him until my friends had gone home.Did children ever enjoy these activities? To me, they seem a poor substitute for real play, in which children spend time outdoors with their peers in an environment that is not mediated by adults.Very little of that happens here these days and we are poorer for it. The 'soft-play centre', where children manically run around health and safety-approved cages, bouncing off padded walls (whilst parents sit in a corner sipping overpriced cappuccinos), is a soulless environment in which play has become commodified, stripped of creativity, spontaneity and risk.The days in which children could form gangs and find dens are long gone, whilst childrens desires for these activities have been sublimated into multiplayer computer games like Club Penguin, most of which are controlled by corporations like Disney.On the plus side, at least no child ever has to endure sheer tedium of making a paper tree these days.Every cloud..."},
{"title": "The New Victorians", "date": "Friday, August 10, 2012", "text": "When someone told me that they'd discovered an album of Victorian photographs, I got excited. Sadly, the actual pictures were a rather disappointing collection of faded images all smaller than the palm of my hand:But thanks to Photoshop, even a print as unpromising as the one above can be transformed:Admittedly, this probably isn't the most fascinating image I've come across (although I find it benignly soporific). However, some of the others are more interesting:This picture may not immediately strike you, but zoom in and it comes alive:In the photograph below, closer scrutiny reveals a figure in the hallway, a cat in the alley and a smiling Victorian:I can also detect the trace of a smile in this photo:Frustratingly, with photos as small as these (which were contact prints from the negatives), the resolution can be improved to a point where you have a tantalising glimpse of people's faces, but no more. Further magnification simply produces a blur.This street scene and the one below were taken in France or Belgium, but I have no idea where.Finally, my favourite photograph from the album:This still life of a mantlepiece and its surroundings fascinates me. Its cluttered look is from an age in which most people had relatively few possessions, cherishing what they had, displaying them with pride.My comparatively minimalist sitting room only has a couple of photos on display. The rest are on various hard drives, which will be completely redundant when civilisation collapses in 2027."},
{"title": "Bonkers", "date": "Wednesday, August 08, 2012", "text": "I feel British again. Like many people, I had come to regard Britishness as an anachronism. In a post-colonial, post-industrial era, its totems seemed irrelevent and I retreated into an identity that was one part English (more specifically, southern English), one part European and one part world citizen. However, Danny Boyle has changed all that.When I started watching the Olympic opening ceremony, I expected to be embarrassed. Last year's unveiling of the Countdown Clock in Trafalgar Square was an awkward, uncomfortable ramshackle affair that was as British as a man making love with his socks on. I squirmed at the awfulness of it.But the opening ceremony was a triumph. It may have baffled 99% of the world, including most people under 25 in Britain, but Danny Boyle's vision was pitch perfect in its reinvention of Britishness for the 21st century.I've read a lot about how the ceremony appealed to people on both the right and left, but for me the real acid test was my mother. She watched it with a group of people in their 80s, most of whom read the Daily Mail and think that there are too many 'coloureds' in Britain. What would they make of what Aidan Burley described as \"multicultural crap\"?They loved it.If I could have changed anything, I would have got rid of the Arctic Monkeys and had fewer people expressing things through the medium of contemporary dance, but the rest of the evening was a box of delights. I particularly enjoyed the spectacle of Dizzee Rascal singing 'Bonkers' to the Queen. It was also a wise move on Danny Boyle's part to give David Beckham a non-speaking role.As for the Olympics itself, I'm completely impervious to sporting triumphs and feel quite indifferent to the growing tally of gold medals. I certainly don't feel proud to be British - I've never understood national pride. However, I suppose I would say that I'm quite happy to be living here. I can't imagine being anywhere else.So as part of my celebration of Britishness, I thought I'd share some photos that I found in books during the last few weeks.First, we have England:On the back, someone has written 'Shaz'z 18th, January 1987'. There may be an 80s revival at the moment, but I haven't seen anyone who has had the courage to revive this look. Why would a teenage girl willingly make herself look 35?Next, we celebrate the musical traditions of Wales:The man on the right seems to be suffering from a moment of existential angst, which is not a good thing when you live in a small town.On the subject of Wales, I found this Welsh version of Ladybird's 'Peter and Jane' series today. Jane is predictably Siân, but for some reason Peter has become Gareth and the dog is Carlo:I studied Welsh at university and managed to achieved a record result for the lowest exam score in the subject.Third, Scotland the brave:This proud father looks slightly pregnant himself, rather like the famous 1970s poster and the haunted expression suggests that he isn't entirely at ease.Finally, a celebration of family life:This cover is from 'The Family Chord Songbook'. I'm sure that if Danny Boyle had had the time, he would have included some organ action.Perhaps there'll be a spot at the closing ceremony, in between the bare knuckle fighting and the 'best-kept village' competition."},
{"title": "Small World", "date": "Saturday, August 04, 2012", "text": "This time two months ago I was making the final preparations for a  family holiday in Spain. I'd booked it during a moment of foolhardy  optimism on New Year's Day, blithely disregarding our oldest son's  agoraphobia and my fear of flying.Three months later, the whole  idea seemed absurd and I was tempted to cancel the booking. But I  naively clung on to the belief that if we could take our son away from  his comfort zone to a beautiful place with warm seas and blue skies, he  would be transformed. Some people never learn.As for the fear of  flying, I decided to undergo a course of hypnotherapy sessions with a  lovely woman who came highly recommended. The hynotherapy seemed to be  very successful. Within minutes of arriving, she was able to put me into  a deep trance and induce a feeling of tranquility that I hadn't enjoyed  since I was a foetus.Sadly, when I sat on a plane for the first  time in six years, I realised that instead of being cured of my phobia,  I had merely been hypnotised into believing that I wasn't scared of  flying. When the plane took off, everything changed and the three-hour  flight was one long silent scream.Since  then, I've been feeling rather gloomy. My son won't travel beyond the  environs of Lewes and I seem to be limited to a damp part of  northwestern Europe.As if that wasn't enough, my wife casually  announced that she'd agreed to look after someone's dog for five weeks,  adding a further layer of restrictions to our movements. My world, which  once extended to South America, had now contracted to a tiny,  dog-friendly corner of England. I wasn't happy.But then, one  afternoon, I walked in the front door and found a small border terrier  looking up at me, with trusting brown eyes. \"This is Maisy\", my wife  solemnly announced. Maisy ambled towards me and jumped up, gently  resting her paws on my legs. I smiled nervously, hoping that she  wouldn't damage the sofa.In many ways, Maisy is the ideal dog.  At home she is only slightly more animated than a stuffed toy, which is  perfect, but outdoors she becomes far more active and performs the sorts  of tricks that children expect from dogs. I can't say that I  particularly relish the hairs and the smell, or having my face licked,  but I'm grateful to her for getting my sons out of the house.The  South Downs are less than ten minutes' walk from our front door, but  persuading the boys to go there is usually almost impossible. If they do  agree to have a walk, the continual carping and moaning puts a bit of a dampener  on things. But since Maisy joined us, they've been up on the Downs  every day: (Trivia fact - this is the site of the Battle of Lewes in 1264, which resulted in the birth of parliamentary democracy)Seeing my youngest son swinging on a farm gate, describing it as \"The  best fun ever\" made me realise that I had to put all of my reservations  about the smell, the hairs, the inconvenience and, worst of all, the  poo, to one side. If this is the price I have to pay for getting my sons  to swap the virtual world for the real one, then so be it.Sadly,  for the boys, this is a holiday romance that will have to end. In just  over a month, Maisy's real family will return from their absurdly long  holiday in France and I suspect that the house will be very quiet  without her."},
{"title": "Six of the Worst", "date": "Wednesday, August 01, 2012", "text": "I've no idea how many secondhand books I've sorted through during the last three years, but even a conservative estimate puts the total at over 100,000. During that time, I've come to several conclusions:Most bestselling authors are destined to go out of print. When was the last time you saw a novel by Naomi Jacob, Howard Spring, Frances Parkinson Keyes or Frank Yerby in a bookshop?Publishers between 1964 and 1979 were obsessed with sexAlmost every book published by Rupert Hart-Davies is worthlessA tatty, obscure 1970s horror title will usually be worth far more than a beautiful old Penguin paperbackThe period from 1954 to 1974 was a golden age for book design, but it also saw some incredibly awful, garish covers, like these reprints of popular classics:Jane Austen is synonymous with refinment and understatement, unlike this hideous jacket design. I particularly hate the almost fluorescent font for the title.Slightly less offensive, but once again with rubbish fonts and a girl who looks like Nellie Olsen, for those who remember 'The Little House on the Prairie'.Cor! A saucy French novel. I'll 'ave some of that! But where's the sex? I'll flick through to the end of the chapter...no, nothing there...maybe the next chapter...no, still nothing.Maupassant and Zola may have been 'racy' in the 1890s, but I suspect that many 1960 book buyers felt that the cover design promised more than it delivered.But the deception wasn't limited to adults. I wonder how many children struggled to read the copy of 'Gulliver's Travels' that Auntie Doris had given them for Christmas?\"Heathcliffe, it's me, Cathy, I've come home\". Perhaps I'm being geeky about fonts, but this one is only acceptable in the credit sequence of a David O. Selznick Hollywood film. Like the Gulliver, this is also a children's edition cover. Lucky kids.Finally, here is the 31st book in the famous 'Bancroft Classics' series:No, I haven't heard of them either, but the cover design is in a class of its own, with Jane Eyre depicted as a 10-year-old with encephalitis. The eyes follow you around the room.If you're feeling corrupted by this horrible display, then I'd recommend visiting this wonderful collection of Penguin and Pelican covers.

{"title": "Wet Afternoons", "date": "Saturday, July 14, 2012", "text": "My wife has been ill since yesterday, so I have been busily washing-up, cleaning the house and entertaining children.  I wish I could pretend that my motives were entirely altruistic, but if it's a virus I may be a day or two behind and need to ensure that I receive the appropriate level of care when my wife recovers.I was going to take my sons out, but the weather has been terrible. Instead, I'm ashamed to say that that are both playing computer games while I've been comparing different performances of a piano composition by Bartok called, ironically, 'Out of Doors'.When I first became interested in music (which curiously coincided with the onset of puberty), it was very difficult to listen to a recording before I bought it. I suppose I could have asked the man in Richmond Records to give me a quick blast, but he had mastered the art of condescension to the point where I was too scared to even ask for a bag. As a result, I was completely dependent on the wonderful Penguin Stereo Record Guide, written by Edward Greenfield, Robert Layton and Ivan March.At an age when I should have been snogging or drinking 'snakebite', I was more likely to be found checking which version of Tapiloa was Robert Layton's recommended recording. My youth was not so much mispent, as unspent (at least, until university).The Penguin guide was usually spot-on, but occasionally I'd be disappointed to discover that so-and-so's performance was much slower or faster than expected and I was unable to listen to the music without a nagging sense of regret. If only I'd had access to YouTube, perhaps I might have learned to realise that every approach has its merits.For example, here are four performances of Bartok's 'Out of Doors' suite. If you try the first 40 seconds of each, you'll hear some very different approaches to the music.In the first extract, once the pianist has made himself comfortable and checked that he hasn't lost his bus ticket, he delivers plays with an almost machine-like tempi, but at least you can hear all of the notes:It's a solid, rather unexciting performance, but he's a dab hand (or foot) with the pedals. However, I prefer the next version, where the faster tempi produce a greater sense of urgency:Much better, although he's a little to free and easy with the sudden, brief changes of tempo. I really like the next version too:Fast and very percussive, with a real sense of momentum. However, the faster speed results in a loss of detail in the passage around 25 seconds - he could take a few tips on pedal use from the Clive James lookalike in the first clip.Finally, this performance takes a very different approach. It probably doesn't help that the pianist left his glasses at home and has to lean very close to the keyboard:This is one of the ways in which I waste my time on wet weekend afternoons when everyone else is occupied. I've also been reading Angelica Bell's autobiography (thanks to the person who recommended it in one of the comments).I was enjoying a guilt-free afternoon. I'd built up credits this morning by going shopping in Lewes, emptying the dishwasher twice, playing Monopoly with my son and doing domestic chores, but daring to write this blog post has tipped me back into the guilt zone. There are still unwashed plates and two children who need to be dragged away from cyberspace.How long is it until their bedtime?"},
{"title": "Taking the Waters", "date": "Tuesday, July 10, 2012", "text": "I've  no idea who this man is, but I have his photo album. Compiled around  100 years ago, the captions are written first in German, then later in  slightly stilted English. I think he may have married an Englishwoman.Today,  when the collective memory of war still taints Anglo-German relations  (and the audience of 'Britain's Got Talent' boos a man who announces  that he's from Germany), it's easy to forget how close the two countries  were before the First World War. The sense of kinship with 'our German  cousins' was reflected in the late Victorian vogue for Teutonic names  like Hilda, Walter and Gertrude.People even went on holiday in  Germany. When I suggested going there to my wife, she snorted and looked  at me as if I'd made an indecent suggestion, but I think she'd be  pleasantly surprised if she went here:This  is Rothenburg, a rather attractive-looking medieval German town. I had  wondered if it had been flattened in the War, but fortunately the  far-sighted mayor of Rothenburg and a senior figure in the US military  worked to ensure that the town was relatively unscathed:A century ago, the album's owner stayed at Rothenburg before moving on to a spa town called Bad Kissingen, where he met a man called Sir Lionel Phillips (seated):Phillips  was a remarkable man. Born in London to a family of Jewish merchants,  he went to South Africa to make his fortune and at the age of 20, walked  the best part of 600 miles from Cape Town to the diamond mines of  Kimberley, where he went on to become a diamond sorter, ran a newspaper  and managed a mine.When this photograph was taken, over 30 years  later, Phillips was a wealthy mining magnate and politician, with a  colourful career behind him. Perhaps too colourful for some people. In  December 1913, he was shot five times by a disgruntled South African  trade unionist.Sir Lionel survived and perhaps he came to Bad Kissingen to take the waters and recuperate. I can only assume that Herr Doktor's treatment worked, as Sir Lionel lived for almost another quarter of a century.I quite fancy the idea of spending several weeks in a spa town, but it would have to be an old-fashioned one with exiled aristocrats and American heiresses. Obviously gyms would be out of the question, but strange machines and ridiculous diets would be allowed (compulsory, in fact).In the evenings I'd dress for dinner and, perhaps, attend a chamber music recital or discuss Schopenhauer with pallid young women.Phillips appears in several photos, including this grainy shot:And this group portrait, with Phillips on the left:Sadly  the rest of the album largely consists of blurry shots of well-known  landmarks around Europe, although there are some interesting views of  Sir Lionel's Hampshire estate, Tylney Hall (now a luxury spa hotel), which he and his wife Florence restored, incorporating the latest Arts and Crafts designs. Even Gertrude Jekyll was roped in.'Mrs Lionel Phillips'There are also two more photographs of unnamed people:The  final photograph is from 1916. The trauma that was experienced by  thousands of Anglo-German families is vividly portrayed in Philip Gibbs' underrated novel 'Blood Relations'.In the 1920s, once the vitriol against the Hun  had subsided, the cultural ties between Britain and German began to be  restored, but of course it was not to last. Sadly, Sir Lionel lived long  enough to witness the rise of Naziism.Unlike most of the photograph albums I've come across, this one gives  the reader a few clues, but the lack of dates and the often illegible  script is frustrating. I had hoped that there might be a memoir or  biography about Phillips, but I can't find anything.As for the mysterious figure who created the album, I don't suppose that  I'll ever discover his identity. But thanks to him, I have discovered a  place I want to visit and a life that I'd like to know more about.I'll send a postcard from Rothenburg."},
{"title": "Afrika", "date": "Saturday, July 07, 2012", "text": "At the beginning of the week I was thinking about how much more interesting this blog used to be when I had access to the vast collection of photo albums and journals that ended up in my old workplace. I miss the personal diaries and the extraordinary pictures that used to lie hidden in a delivery of ex-charity shop books. I miss Derek.Hours later, by an extraordinary coincidence, my ex-boss phoned. I hadn't spoken to him since September. He wanted to know if I'd consider returning to my old job. I was flattered to be asked and said that I would think it over, but I already knew the answer.Going back is always a mistake.I thought ruefully about the photographs I'd never see; but in the second odd coincidence of the day, later found an album at the bottom of a box of dusty books:The photos appear to have all been taken in South Africa around 1911, but the writing is in German. It's possible that some of these scenes were taken in Namibia, which was then the German colony of South-West Africa.Some of the scenes look cosily European, but others provide a stark reminder that these people were in a very different environment:AutofahrtI presume that this is a double exposure, rather than any exotic variety of local faunaAlthough this is Africa, the natives barely feature in this album. They can occasionally be seen in the background, quietly, invisibly performing the menial tasks that allowed the Europeans to enjoy such a high standard of living.Mr KrauseThis photo is one of several that shows damaged buildings and vast crowds of men. I wondered if there was some civil unrest in this period between the Boer War and First World War, but couldn't find any references.This is my favourite picture - an extraordinary image which looks staged, but I'd like to know more about the background (or 'backstory' as everyone seems to say now)This album raises so many questions. Are they German settlers in South Africa and if so, what happened to them when war broke out in 1914? If they lived in South-West Africa, did they remain when the colony was ceeded to South Africa, or did they return to Europe?The children might have lived until quite recently. I wonder what their stories were.Finding this album reminded me that my favourite part of working with 'recycled' books was always the photos, with their tantalising glimpses of lost, forgotten lives. However wonderful a book might be, it is always one of many. A photograph album is unique.I have been distracted by other things during the last nine months, but I'm going to find some new sources of pictures. There's nothing I like more than restoring a worn photograph into an image that gains a whole new lease of life on the internet.I'm sure some readers of this blog will remember this:I hope that there's a lot more to come."},

{"title": "Television Centre", "date": "Tuesday, July 03, 2012", "text": "One of the best books I've come across for a long time is a beautifully-produced 1960 hardback, celebrating the opening of the BBC Television Centre in White City, London. That might not sound terribly exciting, but aside from being a stunning piece of architecture, the Television Centre was also emblematic of Britain's changing identity.I was just going to post a succession of images from the book, but to really capture the energy and optimism of the period you need a bit of BBC Radiophonic music. This clip features a 1960 composition by Desmond Briscoe called 'TV March' :The optimism of the clip is at odds with the reality of a country that was bankrupted by the Second World War and had only recently abandoned rationing, but modernity seemed to offer a new hope. If Britannia could no longer rule the waves,  perhaps it could conquer the airwaves (I'm sorry, it's been a long day).The following three decades were, arguably, the golden age of British broadcasting.My favourite image from the bookIt's hard to believe that the Television Centre is now over 50 years old, but someone in the BBC clearly feels that it is past its use-by date and in 2010, an official announcement stated that all broadcasting from White City would cease by 2013. Thankfully parts of the building are listed.I have only been to the Television Centre once when, due to a horrible misunderstanding, I appeared on Radio Five as a science expert. The building felt like a powerhouse, packed with enthusiastic people in their 20s, rushing around in a very organised manner. I felt like plankton.In a multi-channel, digital age, perhaps we no longer need a huge, modernist behemoth at the heart of the BBC, but I'm sure that I wouldn't be alone in mourning the demise of Television Centre."},
{"title": "Happy Birthday Dad", "date": "Monday, July 02, 2012", "text": "My father would have been 86 today. Sometimes I wish that I could magic him back to life, if only for a day, but I also know that within ten minutes he'd be telling me an anecdote about his scouting holidays and not listening to what I was saying.If I asked him what the afterlife was like, he'd probably tell me about a chap he'd met who knew Lofty Woods, who was stationed at the same RAF base as Bill Kent and suddenly we'd be back to the frustrating conversations we had when, as a teenager, I tried to get my father to talk about his feelings.But my father came from a different age, when talking about emotions was regarded as effeminate or weak. You just put the lid on and got on with things. Perhaps this attitude became more widespread during and after the First World War, when the phrase 'unspeakable horror' became more than a figure of speech.His parents were both working class and when my father left school at 14, he seemed destined to spend the rest of his life in a factory. But then the War came and with it, National Service. My father joined the RAF and spent two years working as an electrician, servicing and repairing Lancaster bombers.After he was demobbed, everybody expected my father to return to his old job in the local factory, but he had other ideas. Instead, he went to night school and studied for the Civil Service Entrance Exam.He passed the exam and joined the National Savings Bank as a clerical assistant. It was a poorly-paid job, but my father regarded it as a step up the social ladder and during the 1950s, he sought to acquire the trappings of a gentleman. Sometimes he didn't get it quite right:I remember cringing with embarrassment as a child when my father appeared in ordinary social situations wearing a bow tie. Other children's dads dressed casually and drove modern cars. My father drove a 1960s Morris Oxford and wouldn't be seen dead without a tie. He even shaved twice a day.With four decades between us, many people assumed that he was my grandfather. His 1930s childhood was very different from mine.As part of his social ascent, my father joined the Young Conservatives and remained a diehard Tory for the rest of his life. Sometimes he felt that they were a little too left-wing and was very relieved when Margaret Thatcher got into power.During my teens I had a very difficult relationship with my father and every meal turned into a blazing row. We disagreed about everything. Politically I regarded myself as fairly moderate, but in my father's eyes I was a militant socialist. When I started listening to classical music my father was delighted, but the moment I started to play \"that flippin' modern rubbish\" we clashed.In hindsight, he was a man in his mid-50s who was frustrated by so many things, not least his job. After years of drudgery his career was really taking off and he had been offered one of the higher posts in the Civil Service, but was losing his sight. It had been a gradual process and both my mother and I had grown used to telling him what colour the traffic lights were when he drove, not facing the reality of his blindness. When my father agreed to take early retirement, it must have been a very difficult decision to make.I was a classic example of \"Be careful what you wish for\". My father wanted a middle class child, but made the mistake of thinking that it would result in a Hay Wain-loving, Conservative-voting clone. Instead, he had an intolerant, opinionated prig who ridiculed his views.Luckily we both grew up and when we stopped feeling threatened by each other, we rediscovered the love that had always been there. I learned to see my father in the context of his background and realised what a remarkable journey he'd made.I can't speak for my father, but I hope he saw that I possessed the same sense of moral conviction that drove him. We may have ended up holding opposing views, but we held them for the right reasons and both despised people who were motivated by self-aggrandisement.As I grew older, I learned to appreciate the best things about my father. The flip side of his bigotry was a moral courage and sense of conviction that didn't waver under pressure. His love was never conditional and he was incredibly loyal to people.The bigotry was frustrating, but if I bought home friends who didn't conform to my father's ideas of normality, he still was unfailingly polite. I remember him cornering one friend, who was black and dressed in outrageously foppish clothes, trying to convince him to join the Civil Service.Today, I judge my father by his actions, not his views. He could be maddening to talk to, but in spite of everything he said, he was one of the kindest people I've known. When he died, I asked people to send donations to Sightsavers rather than waste their money on flowers. In less than two weeks, we had raised enough money for over 50 cataract operations. The funeral was packed.My father almost died in 1994. His last eleven years were spent living a diminished life, limited to short journeys that made him feel terrible. But when my oldest son was born, he found a new reason to live.As I descend deeper into fatherhood and hear myself uttering the same banal cliches that my father did, tutting at the vacuous children's television presenters and complaining about declining standards, I feel a growing sense of humility.I am my father, but possibly not as good."},
{"title": "Something Old", "date": "Friday, June 29, 2012", "text": "Before I bluffed my way into the world of secondhand bookselling, I naively assumed that the older a book was, the more valuable it might be.How wrong I was. With a few notable exceptions, it's the 20th-century books that make any real money.I suppose it's all to do with memory. Long-forgotten titles, that have slipped out of our collective cultural consciousness, can be very hard to sell and I've even had to throw some 18th-century books away.Admittedly the books were very dull and in terrible condition. They couldn't even have graced the shelves of a provincial faux Ye Olde hotel, but it still really went against the grain to bin them as they'd been built to last.As I tossed the books to their doom I thought of their long histories, from their auspicious debuts in the libraries of gentlemen like the one above, to their sad demise - 250 years later - in a skip on a drab industrial estate in Sussex, with Heart FM playing in the background.From Haydn to Rihanna. It was just too awful to contemplate.I'd kept the books for as long as possible, until my desk was surrounded by teetering piles. After a fruitless search for new owners,  I realised that I was in danger of looking like one of those people who bottle their own urine because they won't throw anything away. In the end, the books had to go.Yesterday I found another 18th-century book that will probably also be impossible to sell:Perhaps it's even the book in Gainsborough's portrait, although I think it's highly unlikely that David Garrick would have owned a copy of this:It sounds terribly dull, but in fact it's a box of delights, giving the reader a fascinating glimpse of late 18th-century society:Over 6lb of opium? Nancy Reagan would be spinning in her grave (but apparently she's still alive).In the same chapter, the author makes a few little jokes to allieviate the tedium of the subject matter, creating characters like Roger Retail, Thomas Teapot, Lady Strawberry and Ben Bibant. But my favourite part of the book is a section called 'Rules of Practice', which lists the sorts of things a gentleperson might buy:15 pistols, 16 cwt. of cheese, 22 tons of hay, 81 firkins of soap, 33 yards of flannel, 120 doz. candles, 54 acr. land, 56 pipes of wine, 63 gall. of oil, 99 bushels of malt, 70 barrels of ale, 144 reams of paper, 100 stones of wool, 110 sheep, 18 cwt. of tobacco, 66 gall of rum and 48 acr. of pasture ground.Oh for the days when a gentleman could casually buy 54 acres of land! But I'm not sure about selling 15 pistols to an alcoholic drug addict. It would never happen today.Other chapters concern vulgar fractions, promiscuous questions and evolution - maths was never this exciting when I was at school, but at least it was less complicated. I know that the media keep telling us that young people are getting progessively cleverer, but I'd like to see today's generation of hugging, halter-top-wearing GCSE students tackle this:In fact, whenever I find a very old textbook, I feel humbled by its complexity. If I was transported back to a 1788 classroom, I'd be the one in the corner wearing a dunce's hat.Were people cleverer then? No, of course not. Was the standard higher because the most stupid people were excluded from the education system? As the descendant of generations of barely literate Kentish peasants I'd naturally disagree, but I suspect that Messrs Cameron and Osborne might nod their heads in approbation.I can't say that I have any great yearning to go back to the 18th century, but the prospect of wearing a wig and tricorn hat would appeal greatly. I would also enjoy throwing my silk gloves onto a shop counter and saying \"Sir, I demand satisfaction!\""},
{"title": "After London", "date": "Wednesday, June 27, 2012", "text": "Twelve years ago I was a London commuter, highly skilled at the art of slipping quickly through slow-moving crowds without spilling a single drop of the latte I'd just bought on the station platform. I needed the coffee. After a journey that involved a long walk, a painfully slow bus journey and 20 minutes on a crowded train, I felt exhausted before the day had barely begun.In the evenings I would stand on the platform at Clapham Junction and look longingly at the destinations of the trains that rushed past: Winchester, Exeter St David's, Arundel, Dorchester West. But although I loved the countryside, I never seriously thought about leaving London.In the world before children, I didn't mind commuting. I liked the possibilities of being in a city. Impromptu after-work drinks, publishers' launch parties and gallery exhibitions were easy to get to and although the last trains were never quite late enough, there were always taxis.Today, things are very different. This is how my day at work began yesterday:The sheep in the front is particularly ridiculous, but all of them are fairly absurd. I've noticed that they succumb to fits of mass hysteria twice a day, bleating as if something awful is about to happen. I've checked and it's always a false alarm.When I look at the sheep and the outline of the South Downs in the background, I always feel slightly frustrated that I don't enjoy it more. It's an idyllic place, with no noise apart from the sound of birdsong and the bleating of sheep. In the days of dark winter afternoons on Clapham Junction, this would have seemed too good to be true.But the sad thing is that we are remarkably adaptable. In the same way that my mother became used to having bombs rain down on her between the ages of 10 and 15, I have become quite indifferent to the beauty and tranquility of my new surroundings. Indeed, the main feeling I have when I look at the Downs is guilt over the inadequacy of my response.I feel nothing but sympathy for the very rich. It must be awful to keep having what you thought you wanted, only to be confronted with the terrifying emptiness of your existence. I can quite understand why so many very wealthy people crave novelty and find it hard to settle in one place. The wisest of them realise that philanthropy helps.The one thing that does make my heart lift is that I no longer have to pretend to care about things that aren't important, like 'brand values' and initiatives that I know will fizzle out in a few months.  Today, my working  life has been stripped down to a hut full of books and a field of sheep, but for the first time in years, I look forward to going to work."},
{"title": "Londoners", "date": "Sunday, June 24, 2012", "text": "What makes someone a Londoner?The Canadian writer Craig Taylor examines this question in his excellent book 'Londoners: The Days and Nights of London Now—As Told by Those Who Love It, Hate It, Live It, Left It and Long for It' and finds a bewildering variety of answers from the hundreds of people he interviewed.For some, being a Londoner is simply a matter of having been born within a clearly defined geographical area, but nobody seems to be able to agree what on is and isn't London, with definitions ranging from anywhere within the M25, to a few miles either side of Trafalgar Square.For others, being a Londoner is a state of mind, or a badge of honour that can be earned by anyone who learns to survive in the city.Technically I suppose that I'm a Londoner. I grew up in the London borough of Richmond upon Thames and spent the first three quarters of my life living within ten miles of Hyde Park Corner. But as a child, I always regarded London as a remote, exotic place, full of odd-looking people, where everyone seemed to be in a hurry.The impression of remoteness was compounded by the tortuously slow journey into London by bus and tube, which usually took at least an hour. On the one occasion I cycled into London, I was amazed at how quickly I got there.We rarely went up to London. I was never given a reason, but I overheard depressingly bigoted mutterings about the expense, the coloureds and the people on drugs. My parents were much happier driving out to the Surrey countryside or, if the weather was good, down to the coast, where we would huddle behind a windbreak on pebbly beaches and pretend that it was still 1935.My father always told people that we came from Middlesex and rued the day when the county was absorbed into Greater London, as if a wall had been breached. London was elsewhere. It began somewhere after Putney; on the other side of Hammersmith Bridge; just before Clapham Junction. It wasn't Wimbledon, but it was Acton.For Craig Taylor, Londoners are simply \"the people you see around you. The ones who stock the tube trains and fill the pavements and queue in Tesco with armfuls of plastic-wrapped veg. Whatever their reason or origin, they are laughing, rushing, coniving, snatching free evening newspapers, speaking into phones, complaining, sweeping floors, tending to hedge funds, pushing empty pint glasses, marching, arguing, drinking, kneeling, swaying, huffing at those who stand on the left-hand side of the escalator, moving, moving, always moving. It's a city of verbs.\"But my favourite defintion of a Londoner comes from a stranger that Taylor met in a Cricklewood pub:\"The only thing I know is that a real Londoner would never, ever, ever eat at one of those bloody Angus bloody steak houses in the West End. That's how you tell.\"A 448-page book consisting of 200 interviews with people who live and work in London could be a rather dry read, but Londoners is one of the most moving and compelling books I've come across, with some stories that are more extraordinary than any work of fiction. Anyone who has ever travelled on public transport and wondered about the hidden lives and secret thoughts of their fellow passengers will enjoy this book.Reading Londoners, I felt an increasing admiration for the interviewees' passionate, brave, difficult and sometimes rewarding struggles with an unforgiving city, particularly those who had migrated from abroad, with no family or friends to support them. I also felt a growing conviction that being a Londoner was not a birthright, but something that had to be earned.I have never eaten in an Angus Steak House, but I would never dare to call myself a Londoner."},

{"title": "Gibraltar", "date": "Monday, June 11, 2012", "text": "The entrance to GibraltarOn a list of places I'd like to vist, Gibraltar ranks slightly lower  than Burkina Faso and Wisbech, but when I realised that I'd booked a  holiday in Andalucia during the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations,  the idea of visiting a British colony was too tempting to resist.Before  I begin, let's get the 'c word' out of the way. Too many people  conflate the word 'colony' with 'colonial', which is why territories  like Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands are seen as the dying embers of a  defunct imperial power. If that was true, they would have been  jettisoned with the rest of the British Empire in the late 1950s, but  their relationship with the 'mother country' is quite different.Gibraltar  was captured from the Spanish in 1704 and ceded to Britain in  perpetuity nine years later, as part of the Treaty of Utrecht. During  the next three centuries, the 'Rock' attracted successives waves of  immigrants and the Gibraltarians are made up of many different ethnic  groups, including British, Spanish, Genoese, Portuguese, Italian,  Moroccan, Jewish and Maltese. Today, Gibraltar has a unique identity  that is quite different from Spain's, with a history that is almost a  century longer than Australia's.Naturally, Spain isn't terribly  happy about having a British colony on their soil and it is viewed as a  national humiliation by some. I'd have some sympathy for this viewpoint,  but the Spanish objections are rather undermined by the fact that they  have a very similar colony on the other side of the Mediterranean, in Morocco.I also  think that regardless of the historical rights and wrongs of  colonialism, territorial disputes must defer to the wishes of the  current inhabitants and on several occasions, the people of Gibraltar  have made it clear that they do not wish to be part of Spain (in 2002,  98.4% of Gibraltarians voted to remain part of Britian).Perhaps  one answer would be to cede part of Britain to Spain - maybe the Isle of  Sheppey. I'd welcome the opportunity to enjoy Spanish culture without  having to endure the ordeal of EasyJet and I think that the citizens of  Sheppey would benefit immensely from the introduction of tapas bars and  flamenco dancing.It was going to be a family trip, but everyone  pulled out except our friend Kathryn. \"How long do you think you'll  be?\" my wife asked. I checked the map. Gibraltar was 60 miles away, so  it would be a bit like London to Brighton, plus two or three hours to  have a look around. \"About five hours\" I confidently replied.An  hour later, when Kathryn and I found ourselves on a mountain pass with  terrifying hairpin bends, courtesy of my SatNav lady, we realised that  they journey was going to take a little longer. Kathryn kept apologising  for telling me that I was going too near the edge, while I tried to  reassure her that I'd rather know.What were we doing here?  At one point, we both wondered if the SatNav had been possessed by an  evil spirit.After an hour of what seemed like aimless wandering,  we reached a motoway and started to make up for lost time. Kathryn checked her  Rough Guide and saw that it warned against driving into Gibraltar, recommending parking in the Spanish border town of La Linea and crossing on foot. We  revised our plans and ignored the increasingly frantic pleas of the  SatNav lady.If you ever get a chance to visit La Linea, don't.  It reminded me of all the worst aspects of a Mexican border town - the  petty criminals, prostitutes and all-pervading stench of stale urine -  without any of the redeeming features. Worst of all, because the Spanish  don't like to officially acknowledge the existence of Gibraltar, they  won't tell you where it is.  We spent a miserable half hour in La Linea  before we finally stumbled across the border.By the time we  passed through customs (during which a bored official pretended he  hadn't seen us), a thick mist had descended. Kathryn looked around her  and said \"God, even the weather's British.\"Arriving was a huge  culture shock. On the one hand it was all terribly familiar, from the  red telephone boxes to the London Transport font on the local buses, but the  setting - a blend of 1960s Malta, Ceausescu's Bucharest and  Littlehampton - was deeply unsettling. I felt as if I was in an episode  of 'The Prisoner'.We boarded a bus and began a ridiculously long  and convulted journey that belied Gibraltar's three-mile length,  passing a succession of bland concrete apartment blocks, whose windows  were festooned with Union Jacks. It made the muted displays in Lewes  look positively Calvinst.Two  buses and nearly an hour later, we reached the bottom of the Rock of  Gibraltar, where a cable car shuttled visitors to the 1,400ft high  summit. I'd never been in a cable car before and kept thinking of  'Moonraker'.Travelling in a small metal box suspended on a piece  of string is not for the faint-hearted and I carefully scrutinised the  cable for signs of metal fatigue, whilst Kathryn sat on the floor.  However, as the car climbed above the clouds, we were rewarded with a  stunning view, with the coastline of Africa in the distance:But for me, the real attraction of the Rock was the colony of Barbary Macaques - Europe's only native apes:The  macaques seemed completely indifferent to the humans who visit their  territory, although they apparently like snatching cameras and throwing  them into the sea. Wise creatures.You can sit right next to an ape and they won't move. Some visitors have  mistaken indifference with tameness and been rewarded with a nasty  bite.According  to popular myth, Gibraltar will only remain British as long as the apes  live there. Winston Churchill was susperstitious enough to augment  their population with some Moroccan cousins during the Second World War.Meanwhile, back in the town, the Jubilee fever was hotting up:We  decided that walking back to La Linea would be quicker than travelling  by bus and as we aproached the centre of Gibraltar, I looked forward to  seeing the colony's thriving commercial quarter:Gibraltar  is an internationally-renowned tax haven,  but this hadn't saved it  from the long reach of the global recession. I saw a number of empty  stores - most of them clothes shops. Only Marks and Spencer appeared to  be thriving, which explains why so many women were wearing Per Una.The heart of Gibraltar is a pleasant mixture of 18th and 19th century  stone buildings - Lyme Regis with a Mediterranean twist - and if we'd  had more time, I would have liked to explore the narrow alleys. But it  was getting late and my wife's texts sounded increasingly desperate.We walked back to the border, where a single British bobby looked out  for international drug gangs and illegal imigrants, in between posing  for photographs with German tourists. The Spanish customs official didn't even look up from his computer screen. On the Spanish side of the borderAt the underground car par in La Linea, I programmed a new, direct route  on the SatNav. It had been an exhausting day and I couldn't face any  more mountain passes. Within minutes we were on a motorway, speeding  back to my distraught family. Kathryn texted my wife to say that we'd be  home within the hour.Then it happened again: \"After 500 yards, take the next turning on the  right\" and before we knew it, we were back on a road that was barely  wider than the car, negotiating bends that made Grand Theft Auto look  like Genevieve. My heart sank.By the time we reached another main road we were already three hours  late and the sun was beginning to set. But just as Kathryn and I were  beginning to lose heart, our road met the coastline and I caught a  glimpse of Africa on the other side of the water, so close that you  could see houses and boats.I thought it was wonderful, but Kathryn had had enough: \"Oh, fuck Africa\".It was almost dark when we arrived at our house in Los Caños de Meca. My  wife's irritation at being  left alone for so long had turned into a  relief that we had finally made it back. \"How was Gibraltar?\" she  asked.I quoted Dr Johnson's verdict on Fingal's Cave: \"Worth seeing, but not worth going to see\"."},
{"title": "Trouble in Paradise", "date": "Saturday, June 09, 2012", "text": "I have just returned from a week in Andalucia with my family and a friend of ours.How  and why we ended up taking a child who doesn't even like to go beyond  our front door is a long story and I won't bore you with the details,  except to say that our decision was a triumph of hope over experience  (also, the deposit was non-refundable).I booked the holiday  months ago, in the naive belief that a week in a quiet, beautiful place  might transform our son, restoring his faith in trying new experiences.In  a way, I was right. My son did undergo a transformation, but  unfortunately it was from bad to worse. The one crumb of comfort is that  it is much easier to restrain a 12-year-old than a teenager, so things  could have been far grimmer.During our stay we caught brief  glimpses of the holiday we could have had - family trips to the beach, meals  out and visits to historical towns - but sadly we were caught in a  momentum that we couldn't control and ended up operating a shift system around our son.In spite of everything, the  holiday wasn't a complete disaster. The first night, spent on the  rooftop of a Seville hotel, was a magical experience in which the spires  of the largest cathedral in the world were complimented by a full moon,  darting swallows, a rather nice Spanish beer and a naked woman hanging her washing out on the building opposite. Life doesn't get any better than that.I  also enjoyed my terrifying drive into the centre of Seville, during  which an old man on a bicycle led me around a labyrinth of back streets  that were barely wider than our car. Quite how I managed to reach our  hotel without scratching the vehicle or crushing anyone's foot will  remain a mystery.Seville is apparently the hottest city in  Europe and even at the beginning of June, the temperature reminded me of  Death Valley. Kerbside tapas bars tried to alleviate the stifling heat  with nebulising water spays, but they were no match for the thick stone  walls of Seville Cathedral:Mrs Steerforth and friendThe  cathedral was awe-inspiring, but my favourite place was the stunning  Royal Alcázar palace, with its Islamic-influenced architecture and  breathtakingly beautiful gardens. We went in the evening, outside the  normal tourist site opening hours and were able to experience the  ethereal tranquility without having to jostle with coach parties of visitors:After  a day in Seville, we drove down to Los Caños de Meca - a very pleasant  seaside resort that is slightly spoiled by an excess of dog excrement  and hippies (not the nice, eco-warrior ones, but the old,  leather-skinned variety whose brains have been addled by four decades of  marijuana), where we stayed in a German-owned modernist house.With the exception of a bizarre trip to Gibraltar (which warrants a  separate blog post), we didn't do an awful lot. My wife occasionally  went running with the friend who'd bravely agreed to come on holiday  with us, whilst my sons pottered around in the grounds of the house. I  read a book about London and drank Cruzcampo.In many ways, it was idyllic. The weather was perfect and the only  sounds we could hear were of birds and the distant roar of the surf, but  in spite of this (or because of this) both boys kept asking when they  could go back to England. For them, paradise consisted of bad food, computer games and mild weather.I have learned my lesson."},
{"title": "Sedimentary", "date": "Tuesday, May 29, 2012", "text": "The  other day I took my younger son to Birling Gap where, at low tide, a  rather dull, pebbly beach becomes an enchanted world of rockpools  populated by crabs, anemones and fragile, transparent fish that dart  into cracks the moment they sense danger. My son seemed disappointingly  indifferent to the wonders of marine life, but later told someone that  he was so happy he wanted to cry. Children are strange creatures.What  a contrast to his older brother, who is virtually imprisoned by an OCD  that won't allow him to venture beyond the front door. It has taken me a  while to realise how much my son's condition has changed our lives.  Unlike an accident or conventional disease,  Obsessive-Compulsive  Disorder can assimilate itself so insidiously into the sufferer's world  that  even their family can't always recognise the huge tectonic shift  that  has taken place.Why does one child possess the capacity  for happiness whilst another is wretched? In my sons' case, the glib  answer would be that the world is a much happier place when you're six  than it is at 12, but I don't think that's the answer. Even at six, my  oldest son was a troubled soul.On the beach, I looked up at the cliffs and marvelled at the fact that  they were made up of the skeletons of countless billions of marine  creatures. On the clifftop, tiny figures walked along a thin, grassy  topsoil, probably unaware that the solidity of the landscape was the result of so many forgotten, insignificant, prehistoric lives.I looked at my son. What would he remember of this day, if anything? But  did it even matter? Perhaps the sum total of who we are is like  sedimentary rock, largely comprised of invisible, forgotten events that  have helped to silently create solid foundations.But  I'd done all of these things - the rockpools, the forest walks, the zoo  and the museums - with my oldest son, and they hadn't created a bedrock  of security. If I could go back, what would I change?  I can't think of  an answer.In many ways life has become very challenging. I have had to give up a  secure job for the uncertainty of sporadic, freelance work. My wife and I  now pass like ships in the night, taking it in turns to spend time with  our oldest son. We aren't the house of spontaneity.However, I feel quietly hopeful. The OCD has been very powerful, but it  is no match for a neighbour's Border Collie that appeared one day on the  doorstep, demanding to be taken for a walk. After witnessing  several  professional strategies fail, it was a surprise to see a dog have such a  huge impact, but in many ways it made perfect sense. The front door has  been breached.The next phase will involve territorial expansion: a street corner  today, the postbox tomorrow and the end of the road by Friday. But the  dog may have its own ideas, guided by unknown smells and hidden  memories. My son will follow the dog.I've no idea what will happen next, but I'm now resigned to a life of  living in a house that smells of dog, out in all weathers so that an  incontinent canine can relieve itself.I can't wait."},
{"title": "Joy and the Joystrings Update", "date": "Thursday, May 24, 2012", "text": "Apologies to fans of Salvation Army rockers Joy and the Joystrings. When I saw this 1967 book, I assumed that it was a work of fiction:However, thanks to MikeP, I now know that Joy and the Joystrings were a real band:They were even signed to EMI and released albums like this:And, during their LSD period, ones like this:But what about the music? Actually, it's not bad (epilectic readers may wish to look away):The song doesn't quite live up to the opening riff, which is deceptively mean n' moody, but they give Freddie and the Dreamers a run for their money.The Joystrings appear to have dropped off the pop radar after 1970, but enjoyed a cult following in Salvation Army circles and staged a successful reunion in 2004. This tribute website includes some clips of the band in action.I've threatened to add some Joy and the Joystrings to our holiday car music mix, but Mrs Steerforth has vetoed the idea, so it will have to be a private pleasure."},
{"title": "The Sacred and the Profane", "date": "Wednesday, May 23, 2012", "text": "I'm now on Twitter. I resisted for several years but finally gave in a week ago; partly out of curiosity, but mainly because I was beginning to feel like a Luddite. After a few days in the Tweetosphere, I now realise what has happened to those bloggers who became increasingly quiet during the last couple of years.I can see the uses of Twitter. A journalist friend of mine loves it, as he can canvas opinions, publicise interviews and shamelessly network. By the time he arrives at his desk, he has rubbed shoulders with thousands of fellow Londoners, checked out the latest business news and caught up with the trade gossip. By the time I arrive at my desk, I have passed a dead badger and wondered why people are now saying \"Back in the day\".I'm not sure if I'm suited to Twitter. Sometimes it feels as if I'm at a party and although many of my favourite people are there, it's not quite working because I have to shout to make myself heard. It feels very ephemeral - a sometimes exciting, but an all-too-brief encounter, compared to the enduring relationships of the blogosphere. Perhaps I just need to give it more time.One thing Twitter is very good for is posting amusing book jackets:It sounds quite exciting and the couple in the photo look very animated, but a big bucket of cold water is thrown over the whole thing with the authors' names: Leonard P Barnett and Douglass A Griffiths (just so we don't confuse them with all the other Leonard Barnetts and Douglas Griffiths's).There's certainly no adventure, unless you include trying to cop-off with someone under the disapproving glare of Leonard Barnett.But if you're worried about young people falling under the spell of pop music, with its lustful rhythms and licentious lyrics, here is the answer:As a bookseller, I missed out on the subgenre of novels related to the Salvation Army rock scene.  Ignore it at your peril.After church youth groups and Salvation Army pop concerts, marriage is surely inevitable and doesn't every young woman dream of a pipe-smoking, alsatian-holding man in a v-neck pullover and sta-press trousers that glow in the dark?Look at him. He's every woman's fantasy:I expect he has a lint-covered Murray mint in the deepest corner of his trouser pocket and a young male lover in the youth branch of the Bible Study group, but Avril won't know this until she's tidying out his wardrobe and discovers the gymnasium photos.Bitter and disillutioned, Avril will put  her old life behind her and embark on a new voyage of discovery:This book was published in 1969:One of the least-offensive limericks goes as follows:There was a young lady of CheamWho crept into a vestry unseenShe pulled down her knickersLikewise the vicar'sAnd said: \"how's about it, old bean?\"As far as I know, there was no reprint.As I've commented before, between the Lady Chatterley trial and the advent of AIDS, the media world appeared to have been obsessed with sex. Even classics weren't exempt:Published as part of the 'Boudoir Book Selection'. I love the way it says 'COMPLETE AND UNABRIDGED', implying that some very saucy bits have been left in. I wonder how many people bought this book in hope of some titilation, only to find themselves being lectured about political corruption during the reign of Louis Napoleon?Finally, a novel which may strike a chord with zombie fans:\"Man, she had a shape to make corpses kick open caskets - and she was dead set on giving me rigor mortis\". I can't think of anything to add to that."},
{"title": "Hue and Cry", "date": "Monday, May 14, 2012", "text": "When I told someone that I spent this afternoon with my mother watching Hue and Cry,  I couldn't understand why they looked so perplexed. Then the penny dropped. No, I explained, not the mid-80s Scottish pop duo. I was talking about the 1947 British film that is generally recognised as the first Ealing comedy:My mother and I watch a lot of Ealing films together. She loves them because they give her the opportunity to revisit her the world of her youth. I love them because it beats listening to her repertoire of six anecdotes about other people's illnesses, which are repeated on a never-ending loop. Instead, we sit together in a companionable silence.Hue and Cry may be the first Ealing comedy, but it is also a children's thriller, inspired by the wonderful Emile and the Detectives. The plot is simple enough: a teenage boy discovers that a children's comic called 'The Trump' contains secret messages aimed at London's criminal underground. Ridiculed by the authorities, he decides to tackle the criminals himself, aided by a gang of local children.The intro sequence is one of the most imaginative I've seen from this period and captures the film's fun, knockabout quality:(Sadly, since writing this post, the film's current distributors have had the clips removed from YouTube on copyright grounds. It seems a bit of an own goal, as the clips were effectively encouraging people to buy the DVD) The star of the film is Harry Fowler (centre), who died earlier this year.I didn't recognise the young Harry Fowler, but this face should be familiar to anyone who watched British television during the 1970s and 80s:Although the film poster billed Jack Warner, Alistair Sim and Valerie White as the stars of Hue and Cry, Fowler outshone them all. His performance as Joe Kirby fulfilled the promise he showed five years earlier as the cheeky cockney boy, George Truscott, in Went the Day Well?It's a pity that Harry Fowler ended up playing bit parts in series like Minder and The Bill, as he was a first-rate actor who deserved more starring roles.The other star of the film is, arguably, London itself. Unlike many films of this era, which portrayed an undamaged, prewar city, Hue and Cry shows a war-scarred London of bombed-out houses and empty streets. It is easy to see how the War bankrupted Britain, leaving it with an economy that would take 40 years to recover.But it's not all about bomb sites. One of the strengths of Hue and Cry is that it gives a panorama of postwar London, with just as many scenes shot in the West End, Convent Garden and Hampstead. While I was watching the film, I occasionally stole a glance at my mother and saw her delight at seeing her London. It isn't the past that's a foreign country, it's the future.The girl in this scene was an actress called Joan Dowling, who went on to marry Harry Fowler in 1951. She made a dozen films in six years, but in spite of this success she was, allegedly, bitterly disappointed by her career and in 1953, committed suicide.As for Alistair Sim, although he gets top billing, he only appears in Hue and Cry for under ten minutes. But what a ten minutes! I was very tempted to create a YouTube clip of Sim's performance, but this would spoil the film for anyone who hasn't seen it.On the subject of spoilers, I should stop now.You may be wondering why I'm reviewing such a well-known film, but the truth is that until two weeks ago, I'd never heard of Hue and Cry. Have I been living in a bubble, or is it relatively obscure compared to Ealing comedies like The Lavender Hill Mob?As far as I'm concerned, Hue and Cry is a masterpiece. Apart from being a fun, life-enhancing comedy (much funnier than The Titfield Thunderbolt), it is also a fascinating social document with some stunning cinematography that is worthy of the best film noir. Discovering it was an unadulterated pleasure."},
{"title": "A Slightly Spooky Bloomsbury Moment", "date": "Wednesday, May 09, 2012", "text": "Last week I wrote this post about a trip to Virginia Woolf's home in Rodmell and almost included this photo of Woolf with her niece, Angelica Bell:I'd seen a copy of it in Virginia Woolf's writing room and was immediately struck by the image. Apart from being beautifully composed, Angelica is very striking, with a pretty but rather solemn, adolescent face. Apparently she found life in the Bloomsbury Group a bit of a bore when she was young, as there were no other children to play with.During the visit, I wondered if Angelica was still alive, but after looking at the date of the photo it seemed rather unlikely. The next day, I wrote the blog post and in the end, decided not to use the photo, as there were already more than enough images. Then I forgot all about Angelica Bell.But today, during a quiet moment this afternoon, I looked up Angelica Bell on Wikipedia and discovered that when I was looking at her photo in the garden she knew so well, she was still alive. Horray! The link with the Bloomsburys, TS Eliot, EM Forster, Lytton Strachey and Keynes wasn't comletely severed.But then I read on and discovered that sadly, Bell died the following day at the age of 93, just as I was deciding not to include a photo of her in my post. As Dame Edna would say, that's spooky.Angelica, left, in CharlestonIt's too late in the evening for a potted biography of Angelica Bell's bizarre life, but if you don't know how she discovered that her father wasn't her father and ended up marrying his lover, becoming Mrs Anglica Garnett, click here for the Wikipedia entry or here or here for an obituary.You won't regret it."},
{"title": "A Taxing Problem", "date": "Tuesday, May 08, 2012", "text": "The knives are out for Amazon. Following a recent report that revealed that they are allegedly guilty of tax avoidance*, the great and the good of the UK book industry have lined up to condemn the online retailer. My old boss James Heneage recently described Amazon as \"dangerous\", whilst Tim Waterstone condemned them as \"rude, contemptuous, arrogant and subversive\".Strong words, but relatively mild compared to Waterstones' (the apostrophe was officially moved in January) current managing director, who branded Amazon a \"ruthless, moneymaking devil\". Devil? That sort of hyperbole is usually associated with some of the more outspoken members of the Iranian parliament, not retail executives.Amazon have clearly got under a few people's skin.James Heneage, somewhere in WiltshireAccording to James Heneage, Amazon are \"damaging the high street book trade and threaten to undermine publishers' ability to nurture new talent. If you are concerned about the sort of books that get published you have  to look to the future and the amount of value that businesses like  Amazon can remove from the publishing business model\".Heneage goes on to argue that \"great writers such as Patrick O'Brian and Joanna  Trollope...did not start out as uniquely brilliant. (They) built gradually because publishers worked with them and had  the money to invest, and pay for the expertise that spotted the books in  the first place.\"There is a lot to be said for this argument. I remember how it took around ten years for Ian Rankin to become a bestselling author, by which time he had written over a dozen books. When I worked at Waterstone's in the early 90s, the only Rankin we'd heard of was Robert, the author of humorous fantasy novels.(On the subject of Robert Rankin, I once had an embarrassing exchange with a middle-aged woman who'd asked what I'd recommend for her 17-year-old son. When I said \"Has he tried Rankin?\" she misheard me, but to her credit didn't bat an eyelid and replied \"Well, I suppose that would keep him quiet\")Ian Rankin could have continued to languish in the midlist, but he had a publisher that believed in him (probably encouraged by a recent Gold Dagger award) and they relaunched the Rebus novels with new jackets and a nationwide marketing campaign. It worked and the rest is history.I wonder how Ian Rankin would fare today if he'd just written his first Inspector Rebus novel? Would he find a publisher for 'Knots and Crosses' as easily as he did in 1987 and if he had, would they publish a further six books before Rankin really hit his stride with 'Black and Blue'?It's possible that a writer of Ian Rankin's talent could still succeed today by circumventing the normal publishing process. Several lesser writers have gained publishing deals by making their work available for nothing (or a nominal fee) to Kindle readers, allowing viral marketing to do the rest. But could Ian Rankin have afforded to do this without the financial support of a publisher?As far as I was concerned, James Heneage had hit the nail on the head, but then I read this (and please forgive me for quoting it at length):\"I don't like it when someone like James Heneage steps forward to give  the media a quote and blows it by mumbling about irrelevancies. Perhaps  he is being misquoted or the paper is focussing on what were intended to  be peripheral remarks, but this article makes it seem like his main objection to Amazon is that they're not really members of the club.Firstly (sic) he seems to believe that great authors need to be nurtured by  publishers: eliminating publishers imperils literature. I personally am  quite sure that great authors will continue to emerge if 'publisher'  goes the way of 'lamplighter' or 'footman'. He also seems to believe  that publishers have an important role spotting those great writers:  without publishers we wouldn't notice the diamonds in the rough. I agree  that's a role publishers fill... for now. But if what replaces the  current model is readers reading any old thing, including lots of  self-published novels, and then blogging and tweeting about them, I  think we'll see books with lasting appeal being taken up more not less  quickly. I won't lament the loss of the 'kingmaker' role in publishing.  And there will still be prominent figures who can champion new writing.Heneage also thinks that Amazon is not 'investing'  enough in the  industry, in (implied) contrast to the way that publishers do. He  doesn't elaborate, but single-handedly developing and popularising a  global e-book platform sounds like investing to me. As does allowing any  solvent reader with an internet connection to get any book through the  mail in a day or two - including titles that 99% of bricks-and-mortar  stores never carried. And it may not be the sort of investment Heneage  likes, but Amazon have also made books cheaper. In fact I would say that  the problem is that Amazon is investing too much rather than too  little.                                                              Heneage  concludes by saying that if you have the long-term success of the  industry at heart you don't undermine the competition too much. This is a  terribly woolly remark. Is he suggesting that the only thing that's  stopped Macmillan or Random House from grabbing 99% of the book market  is a sportsmanlike restraint and a custodial mindset? The directors of  publicly-traded firms would be fired if they announced they'd called a  halt to growth because they were worried about the competition.\"The author of this extract is Rob Jones, co-owner of the small publisher Snowbooks (you can find the full article on their blog, here) and he argues his case very persuasively. He could have added that what's happening now is the logical outcome of a process that allowed Ottakar's to expand so quickly during the ten years following the collapse of the NBA.However, the advent of self-published ebooks is my idea of hell. Yes, there are some very good novels that have failed to gain the attentions of agents and publishers, but how can we identify them amongst the thousands that are available? It's equally woolly to suggest that the glut of self-published books can be successfully curated by a loose coalition of bloggers and tweeters.I regularly receive emails inviting me to read and review a 'remarkable' new novel by an author I've never heard of. If I had more time on my hands and wasn't such a slow reader, perhaps I'd occasionally take some of these offers up out of curiosity. But life's too short.  I'd rather spend my spare time reading unread masterpieces like 'Catch-22' or 'Mansfield Park'.Even if I did review the new thriller that claims to \"revive the genre with a splendid mixture of innovation and cutting edge timeliness\" (I'm quoting from the publicist's email), what are my credentials? What's my relationship to the author? I'm not against amateur criticism and trust the integrity of bloggers like John Self far more than some of the 'You scratch my back...' reviews that appear in the broadsheets. But with the exception of John Self, Caustic Cover Critic, Gaskella and a few other notable book bloggers, I still prefer to leave it to the professionals rather than wade through the blogosphere.As far as Amazon are concerned, I think it's naive to expect them to do anything other than avoid paying taxes.  Unless they suffer a drop in sales from outraged UK customers (and let's face it, they won't), Amazon can't be expected to unilaterally sacrifice a sizeable chunk of their net profit. That's why governments need to force the issue rather than simply trust 'the market'.What's the point of this article? I did have one an hour ago, but that was before a succession of \"Daaa-aaad, Daaa-aaad\"s from upstairs completely broke my concentration...Naughty Amazon, yes, but they're very good at what they do and unlike some people, I love ebooks, seeing a wonderful opportunity to bring thousands of obscure titles back into print.As for James Heneage, I'm not sure if he's in a position to complain when, 15 years ago, he was charging across the high street bookselling landscape like Attila the Hun, driving many independent bookshops out of business (I know, because I was one of his henchmen). Admittedly Ottakar's paid its taxes and James was a wonderful man to work for, but like Amazon, we used our buying power to drive the competition out of business.Nobody knows quite how the book industry is going to change during the next decade, but there are two certainties: bookshops will continue to close and ebook sales will probably overtake those of paperbacks. The worst case scenario is a virtual Amazon monopoly, with Kindle charts dominated by thousands of self-published titles of questionable quality. But in the same way that the best independent bookshops are thriving (think Topping's or Much Ado), I believe that imaginative publishers and booksellers will ride the storm successfully.I'm sorry if this post has rambled. There was a cogent argument here somewhere, but it disappeared into the ether, aided by screaming children and an exploding lightbulb (or was it my Kindle?).* Thank you to the kind person who advised me to change the original word to 'avoidance'."},
{"title": "An Afternoon With Virginia Woolf", "date": "Friday, May 04, 2012", "text": "Although I only live five miles away from Virginia Woolf's rural retreat of Monk's House, it has taken me ten years to get there. I tried to go on several occasions, but the house never seemed to be open, limiting its admission times to the odd afternoon. Fortunately, the National Trust have now extended the opening hours.As yesterday was a particularly dull, dank, overcast day, with a muted light that felt as if the sun was failing, I decided that this was a good opportunity to enjoy Monk's House without being jostled by any Virginia Woolf fans - they're famed for their brutality.It took ten minutes to reach the idyllic village of Rodmell, but the incredibly noisy birdsong made me feel as if I'd travelled to a remote, temperate rainforest. I was also slightly unnerved by the fact that although I occasionally heard voices, the village seemed to be completely deserted. Perhaps I've watched too many episodes of the Avengers.Unlike many historic properties, the entrance fee was very reasonably priced at under a fiver, but that's probably because most of the house was off limits, with only four rooms on view. However, the gardens alone make Monk's House worth a visit:The building in the background is the early Norman church of St Peter's. It is believed that the font predates the church and may be over a thousand years old. The view from the graveyard reminds me of an Eric Ravilious painting:This is Woolf's writing room. It's an inauspicious-looking building, but played host to some of the most important figures of the early 20th century. For example, the man on the right is John Maynard Keynes:Keynes is also in this photo taken in the garden, with Lytton Strachey on the left:Here are some photos taken from inside the writing room:Even on such a gloomy day, the garden still provided some colour:This is the downstairs bedroom:Compared to Charleston, it seems quite austere, but there are several nice touches by Vanessa Bell. The original books were sold after Leonard Woolf died in 1969, but they have been replaced with volumes from the same period.Apparently, Woolf decorated the spines of these books as a displacement activity when she was feeling at a particularly low ebb.The sitting room looks very cosy, with many appealing touches by various members of the Bloomsbury Group.The large object to the left of the chair is a radiogram, with one of those wonderful dials that lists places around Europe: Luxembourg, Athlone, Paris, Budapest. Woolf was no stranger to the radio and made this recording for the BBC in 1937.The photograph below is of the dining room, which is rather small for the social milieu of the Woolfs. These chairs have supported many famous bottoms, including TS Eliot's, EM Forster's, the Bells' and Roger Fry's:The painting on the right is by Virginia Woolf. It's competently executed, but she clearly didn't possess her sister's artistic talents.To coin Doctor Johnson's quote about the Giant's Causeway, on its own merits, Monk's House is worth seeing, but not worth going to see unless you're a Virginia Woolf fan or live within a 30-mile radius. If the whole house was open, it would be a different matter.Fortunately, the creative powerhouse of the Bloomsbury Group -  Charleston - is only a few miles away (Virginia regularly walked across  the Downs to visit her sister Vanessa there), so it's possible to  combine the two in half a day. Ideally, if you're fit and weather's good, you can walk from Monk's House to Charlestone via Southease and  Firle Beacon.I've been to Charleston several times and would strongly recommend it to anyone. The rooms are stunning and the guided tours are the most interesting I've been on. There's also a rather nice teashop that serves homemade cakes - a definite plus point.For more information about opening times, this link takes you to the National Trust page for Monk's House whilst this one is for Charleston.N.B - Since publishing this post, I've realised that I failed to mention the beautiful parish church in Berwick - only a mile east of Charleston - which was decorated by Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant. No visit to Monk's House and Charleston would be complete without a brief detour to Berwick. For fans of the moving image (and middle-aged men wearing floral, metrosexual shirts), this video contains a beautifully-shot five-minute film of Monk's House, complete with marimba music."},
{"title": "Why I Wish I'd Been Born in 1946", "date": "Wednesday, May 02, 2012", "text": "When was the best time to be born?There are many periods that I'd like to visit if I could: Britain during the late Victorian age, America in the 50s, or Andalucia before the reconquista are three that instantly spring to mind. But would I want to swap them for my comfortable world of antibiotics, hot water and edible food? I don't think so.Sometimes I find myself yearning for a world where no-one has ever heard of Alesha Dixon or Facebook, but if I start to get dewy-eyed about the past, I remind myself that history is always written by the winners and survivors. The stories of the millions of individuals who lived Hobbes's \"poor, nasty, brutish and short lives\" will never be heard.After a great deal of thought, I've chosen 1946 as the best time to be born. If I'd been born ten years earlier, I would have experienced warfare, rationing and Shirley Temple films. But in the late 1940s, I'd be entering a world in which improved healthcare and educational opportunities were transforming the lives of millions.Also, I could enjoy growing up in the world of Ealing comedies, Uncle Mac and steam engines.It's a world that is celebrated in a Ladybird book I found recently, which has the slightly creepy title 'In the Train with Uncle Mac':This is a Britain that now only exists in model railway displays and episodes of Chigley. It is a world of timeless villages and market towns, where technology has unobtrusively augmented peoples lives rather than changed them beyound all recognition.Old maids still cycle to communion, village greens echo to the sound of willow on leather and car ownership is limited to the great and the good.\"Hullo! Here are our friends Bob and Betty just off on a long journey to the seaside. Dog Trigger is with them, so they are happy\". Whatever happened to 'hullo'? Nobody uses it any more, although Lionel Richie's notorious song sounds more like hullo than hello to me. Even hallo is disappearing.I don't know how old Bob and Betty are, but I don't think I'd send them halfway across the country, unaccompanied, on a journey that includes changing in London.It's time to leave and this smartly-dressed guard is a stark contrast to the scruffy, slouching men in donkey jackets who shuffled around the station platforms of my youth, blowing their whistles half-heartedly and shrugging their shoulders when I told them that the Nestle machine had swallowed two 5p coins.\"It is thrilling to stand on a railway footbridge and watch the trains rush by\"In those days, even a small, provincial station would have a full complement of staff, including porters, guards, clerks and signalmen:I have vague memories of waving to men in signal boxes when I was very young. They always waved back. Then the signal boxes became automated. I wonder what happened to the signalmen?\"Bob and Betty are by themselves, but the guard will keep an eye on them\". Oh, well that's all right then.\"So at last our express train has reached London where all is bustle and hurry\". It's time to change trains and the station porter is giving Bob and Betty directions to the Underground. But hasn't anyone noticed that creepy stranger standing right behind them?Oh dear - it's that man again. Bob and Betty are so excited by the underground train that they haven't noticed that they're being followed.\"The train is rather noisy, and it sways and rattles as it rushes along\".The stranger sits next to Bob and Betty, pretending to read a newspaper.Betty has now noticed the strange man following them and a woman on the down escalator looks concerned. But as they reach the top of the escalator, the man is stopped by a policeman, who seems to know him. Perhaps the man is a detective.\"There is a kitchen on the train and a real chef to cook the meals. Betty and Bob are smiling at the thought of a jolly good meal\"Bob and Betty are about to enjoy a bowl of thin, tasteless oxtail soup and a shepherd's pie of indeterminate origin, washed down with two glasses of weak squash.\"Betty and Bob had a glimpse of the driver. But an equally important person is the fireman, or stoker. He MUST keep up steam for the engine to pull the train. He shoots more and more coal into the great furnace and the wheels go faster and faster. Well done, fireman!\"Sadly, the recently-qualified fireman is unaware that the line is due to be electrified in a couple of years..\"Bob and Betty know that the long run is nearly done\"\"Thank you for a safe and lovely journey!\"\"Glad you enjoyed it!\" grins the driver, while the fireman waves a grimy hand. The engine, too, looks dirty but somehow very proud\".So there you have it: incontrovertible documentary evidence that if I'd been born in 1946, this was the world I would have grown up in. A society in which youth crime meant St Trinians and young men who wanted 'respect' wore tweed.It might have been a stuffy, stifling world, but that wouldn't have affected me because by the time I'd reached 18, everyone would have been listening to the Rolling Stones and sleeping with each other.Obviously I'm being silly, but there is a kernel of truth. My wife's parents were part of the theatrical world of the 1960s and whenever I hear anecdotes about them or their friends, it sounds as if they lived in an enchanted age. It's not that stories themselves that impress me, but the incidental details: being able to move around London easily by car, turning up at the BBC to see if they have a job and actually getting one (which changes from teaboy to assistant producer within  months), buying a four-storey house in Islington for a few thousand and the way a casual flirtation would end up in bed.It was an enchanted time, for some at least, because it felt as if they lived in a world of possibilities where people were no longer tied to jobs or relationships for life. This experimentation was all done against the backdrop of their secure, Uncle Mac childhoods, blissfully unaware of the consequences of their actions on the next generation.If I'd been born in 1946, I would also be retiring at a time when health care, benefits and private pensions were still sustainable.I could spend my dotage enjoying fond memories of exciting holidays with Betty and Trigger, travelling across Britain by train, being offered sweets by kindly strangers.NB - People born in 1946 include Stephen Spielberg, Sylvester Stallone, Alan Rickman, Susan Sarandon, Tommy Lee Jones, David Lynch, John Waters, Brian Cox, Charles Dance, Diane Keaton, Danny Glover, Cher, Charlotte Rampling, Dolly Parton, Liza Minelli, Freddie Mercury, Joanna Lumley, Felicity Kendal, George W Bush, Steve Biko and Philip Pullman."},
{"title": "A Man With a Van", "date": "Saturday, April 28, 2012", "text": "I am a broken man, crushed by the ordeal of physical labour. I don't suppose that I've done anything out of the ordinary - thousands of people load and unload vans every day - but it has been a shock after seven months of relative indolence.I won't bore you with the details, except to say that I have been moving some furniture for someone over the last couple of weeks, driving a large van that has 166,000 miles on the clock and a suspension that amplifies the tiniest piece of grit on the road into something that resembles artillery fire at Stalingrad.I'd burned some CDs of Radio Four podcasts to relieve the tedium of motorway driving, but even at full volume, Andrew Marr couldn't compete with the constant squeaking and rattling of metal parts trying to separate. I hadn't heard metal make noises like that since Das Boot.The nadir came when the wipers stopped working during a flash flood on the M23 and the view ahead turned into a pointillist landscape of greys and dark greens. I took the first exit I could find and stopped at a layby, where I texted Bob, the van's owner: \"Coming back. Wipers not working.\"20 seconds later, my phone buzzed with a new text message: \"Is it raining?\"In fairness to Bob, he fixed the fault quite promptly, swapping the broken fuse for the windscreen wipers with the one that operated the indicators. It was a novel solution, but I would have preferred to have been warned, as the honking and v-signs were making me quite paranoid.The next day I did my last job for Bob, who gallantly provided me with a man who could stick his arm out of the window if I wished to turn left. Fortunately, the route was only six miles long and quite direct, so neither of us were required to perform any hand signals.It looked as if everything was going to be all right after all. Sadly, at the final destination, I miscalculated the angle I needed to reverse into someone's drive and ended up getting stuck in the middle of their lawn. It took an hour to free the van from the quagmire I'd created and as we crept forward, it revealed a scene of desolation that reminded me of the Somme. I felt awful.I'm not quite sure how I ended up agreeing to work for Bob. I think it was something to do with the mindset that comes with being self-employed, feeling obliged to say yes to any opportunity that comes along, regardless of how suitable it is.But perhaps I also just liked the idea of driving a very big van."},

If they've just give you a naughty little frisson of lexicographical pleasure, then I would recommend this enjoyable article about obscure words, by Will Self.But for me, the high point of Self's piece had nothing to do with logolepsy:\"As for visual arts, the current Damien Hirst retrospective at Tate  Modern is a perfect opportunity to see what becomes of an artificer  whose impulse towards difficult subject matter was unsupported by any  capacity for hard cogitation or challenging artistry. The early works -  the stuffed animals and fly-bedizened carcasses - retain a certain -  albeit recherché - shock value, while the subsequent ones degenerate  steadily to the condition of knocked-off merchandise, making the barrier  between the gift shop and the exhibition space evaporate in a puff of  consumerism.\"That has to be one of the most galumptious things I've read in a long time."},
{"title": "A Publishing Question", "date": "Friday, April 20, 2012", "text": "On the off chance that somebody in the publishing industry may stumble across this blog, I have a question that I'd like to ask (don't worry, I haven't written a novel or, even worse, a collection of 'lyrical' short stories).I have a book that was published in 1943, containing the memoirs of a pilot in Bomber Command. Unlike many autobiographies from this period, the narrative has a disarmingly contemporary feel and reminds me of Geoffrey Wellum's bestselling memoir 'First Light'. In some places the writing almost reads like a screenplay.It's a remarkable book. I bought it a few years ago in a charity shop and forgot all about it. When I went on to get a job working with old books, I neglected reading any of my own as I wanted a break from foxed pages and cracked hinges in my spare time, preferring clean new paperbacks. But the other day I found the book in my wardrobe and was immediately struck by the author's vivid prose style.I've tried to find out more about this title, but I can't find any copies on sale anywhere in the world. I've also found it impossible to learn anything about the author, which obviously has a bearing on copyright.I could put the book on sale, hoping to attract a decent price for such a scarce title, but I'd rather see it gain a new generation of readers.Does anyone in the know have any recommendations?"},
{"title": "Under the Influence", "date": "Tuesday, April 17, 2012", "text": "During a failed attempt to create some space in my wardrobe this afternoon, I was confronted with some of my less judicious internet purchases - all bought under the influence of alcohol.I don't mean to sound like a candidate for the Betty Ford Clinic. I'm not a heavy drinker, but I do enjoy a couple of glasses of wine in the evening and that, it seems, is all it takes to undo years of education and experience.Here are some recent examples:1.  An insect in amber:There is something wonderful about an insect in amber. It is the immediacy of it. We aren't looking at the fossilised remains of a creature; we are looking at the thing itself, trapped tens of millions of years ago in the resin of a tree. It makes my head hurt.During one of these moments of wonder, aided by a particularly nice glass of Pouilly Fume, I ordered an insect in amber on eBay. Sadly, it turned out to be a particularly dull specimen - more of a speck really - in a piece of amber that is smaller than the nail of my little finger. A huge disappointment.2.  A boxed set of 'The West Wing':I'm sure it's wonderful. I like political dramas and really enjoyed Borgen, which is supposed to be a Danish version of The West Wing, but unless my children are sent to boarding school or I find a job on an oil rig, I don't know when I'm going to have time to watch all 59 seasons.Why did I order something that I can't watch?3. A meteorite:Like the insect in amber, there is something awe-inspiring about holding a lump of rock that has travelled through space, but once again, it's very small. Is it even a meteorite? Sometimes I wonder if it's just a bit of molten metal that's fallen on the floor in some obscure foundry in a former part of the Soviet Union. How can I tell?4.  An archery lesson:Two years ago I visited a medieval fair and saw an archery stall. I decided to have a go and, to everyone's surprise, scored one bullseye after another. At last, a sport I was good at!When Groupon sent an email offering a 75-minute archery lesson for under £20, it seemed like the best idea in the world. But in the cold light of day, I found myself thinking \"Oh, I suppose I'd better have that archery lesson. I hope it doesn't rain\". Still, at least I'll have a defence against the marauding gangs in the post-apocalyptic world.5.  The complete works of Webern:I like the idea of Webern. He reacted against the fin de siecle culture of the years leading up to 1914, rejecting the opulent, inflated late-romanticism of the time in favour of a new discipline. His music was uncompromisingly austere, with increasingly shorter compositions for ever-smaller ensembles of musicians (sadly, this process of compression came to a premature end when Webern was accidentally shot by a GI in 1945).Unfortunately, I just can't listen to it.I think I must have liked the idea of conquering the complete works of Webern when I ordered the boxed set, but in the cold light of day it wasn't such a good idea.I like difficult music. I can quite happily listen to this, but not Webern.6.  A Queen Elizabeth I sixpence:I'd always thought that a coin this old would be impossibly expensive. When I discovered that they were actually very affordable, I couldn't resist the temptation to own something that had passed through so many hands. But it was an impulse.I'm not against being online under the influence of alcohol - this blog is largely a product of those second glasses of wine - but after exploring the depths of my wardrobe, I think that there's a strong case for ensuring that all transactional websites emulate the high street, closing their virtual doors at 5.30pm."},
{"title": "The View From My Door", "date": "Sunday, April 15, 2012", "text": "I've moved to a new workplace. I think I'm going to like it:When I was younger, standing on windswept suburban platforms, watching trains full of exhausted people make their way back to the less fashionable parts of London, I used to dream of escaping to the countryside.But instead, I moved to a small, affluent London suburb that had been picked up and dropped in the middle of the Sussex Downs at some unspecified point in the past. The dinner parties with people from Stoke Newington continued unabated, but without the absurdly long bus rides (or the nocturnal cab journeys, driven by someone who had only just arrived in Britain) between places that were only a few miles apart.It was the perfect solution. I could see the countryside in the distance, but wasn't obliged to engage with it in any way.However, during the last few months I have spent a lot of time on farms and have grown to love the silence and remoteness. Ridiculously, I didn't know how much countryside there was. My journeys along arterial main roads hadn't exposed me to the vast interior of the Weald, where it is still possible to escape from light pollution and the distant roar of traffic.I love the fact that I can be sitting in an office, connected to the internet, but all I can hear is the sound of sheep, cows and birds.Last week I was sitting at my desk, answering some emails, when a sheep came up to my window and stared at me for three minutes. I tried waving and flapping my arms around to get a reaction, but it continued to look me calmly in the eye, with a uniquely ovine insouciance. In the end, I was rescued by the distraction of some gamboling lambs.I'm sure that my rural idyll will seem less appealing in December, but at the moment I feel as if all of those hours spent at Clapham Junction and countless bus stops, have finally been rewarded."},
{"title": "Booksellers", "date": "Thursday, April 12, 2012", "text": "After  my recent post about publishers' sales reps, it seems only fair to turn  the spotlight round to the booksellers. What type of people work in a  bookshop? Are they passionate, slightly unworldly bibliophiles, who live  and breathe books? Or are they a bunch of slackers, who break out into a  cold sweat at the prospect of having to do a proper job?During a  very dull moment in a waiting room, I tried to remember everyone I'd  ever worked with. I got to 200 before my memory started to become hazy. I  felt slightly guilty when I realised that I hadn't given some of my  ex-colleagues a second thought since we'd last met, but I expect they'd  probably say the same about me.The weekend staff were  particularly hard to remember. The boys, who all seemed to be studying  'A' level English, merged into one amorphous blend of earnestness and  skin complaints, although there were a couple who amused me by telling  dirty jokes (which I then passed on to the reps).The girls were easier to recall because some of them had recently friended  me on Facebook, in a barrel-scraping attempt to pass the 500/1000  friends mark (I quietly 'defriended' them after a suitable period, but I  doubt that they noticed).However, they weren't 'proper'  booksellers. The weekend staff were merely taking a brief pitstop on  their way to a glittering career (at least, that's what they told me).  The idea of becoming a full-time bookseller horrified them almost as  much as the thought of their parents having sex.When I asked one girl what job she wanted to do, she replied: \"I don't know yet, but I do know one thing: I'm not going to work here.\" She later became our floor manager.As  for the proper booksellers, in the early days of Waterstone's, the  slackers ruled the roost. For them, bookselling was a continuation of  university life, with its constant shortage of money and cramped  bedsits; redeemed only by brilliant conversations with like-minded  people and long periods of inertia. The hours weren't as great, but at  least you didn't have to wear a suit.Anyone who actually wanted to be a bookseller was regarded with a mixture of contempt and suspicion. Was that really the limit of their ambitions?In  hindsight we were probably awful. Our hatred for the customers - those  people who dared to interrupt our conversations and ruin our displays by  buying the books - was only exceeded by our contempt for a head office  who lived in an ivory tower and dared to suggest that we should only  stock books that seemed likely to sell. Philistines!Oddly  enough, the customers seemed to like our bolshy attitude and  inappropriate clothing, so when one male member of staff decided to  create a bondage outfit out of dustbin bags (complete with holes for the  nipples) and serve at the till, no-one batted an eyelid.The  till-points of Waterstone's contained many frustrated writers, artists,  teachers and media people, waiting for their dream job to come along.  Surprisingly, their hopes weren't always in vain. After a year of  displaying no discernible work ethic or talent, X would effortlessly  drift into a key role at the British Council, whilst Y suddenly became a  production assistant at Channel Four. How did that happen?The Waterstone's staff uniform, circa 1993At  the end of five years of watching other people move on to better  things, I felt that I ought to create an illusion of progress and left  to run an independent bookshop. At the time it seemed like a sound move,  but I quickly discovered that I was working for the Arthur Daley  of bookselling, with van loads of dodgy stock mysteriously appearing on  the shop floor overnight. I didn't want to be Terry McCann, so I  started job hunting.In 1996, a new bookselling chain - which  seemed to have risen without a trace - was advertising for managers.  After a rather unconventional interview with James Heneage, the managing  director, I became a 'manager-in-waiting' at Ottakar's.Ottakar's,  which was a nationwide chain of smallish shops in market towns, was a  revelation. I soon realised that outside London, booksellers were a very  different breed. The staff I met actually seemed to take a pride in  their work and would happily break-off a conversation if they saw that a  customer needed help. I felt as if I had joined a group of evangelical  Christians: wide-eyed, enthusiastic and committed. Some of them even wore ties.I've  no doubt that the good morale was a reflection of the leadership, but I  also noticed that outside London, booksellers were generally more  motivated than my former colleagues. They weren't passing through on  their way to something better. This was their career.Keeping up with such enthusiastic people was exhausting, but I did my best.At  Waterstone's most of the staff I met were in their 20s and all of them  were graduates, as Tim Waterstone refused to employ anyone without a  degree (by doing this, he missed out on some very good booksellers). Ottakar's was very different, with a mixed bag of people whose ages  ranged from 16 to 65. Some of them had degrees, but many had simply  joined when they left school or moved across from a completely different  area of retail. Sometimes the recruitment criteria were a little too lax, for me at least.It took a while to get used to seeing a copy  of the Daily Mail (or worse) in the staff room and when I spotted  well-thumbed copies of novels by Patricia Cornwell and Terry Pratchett, I  realised that there weren't going to be many fist fights for a proof  copy of the latest Umberto Eco.My shop in CrawleyI  was at Ottakar's for ten years and, during that time, came to recognise  similar types in every branch I ran or visited. Every shop had its high  flyer (usually under the age of 23) who seemed more competent than the  manager and was usually destined to be their boss in four years' time.  Some managers felt threatened by them. I just saw an opportunity to take  a long holiday without worrying about the shop.These high flyers were usually counterbalanced by one or two no-hopers who could spend an hour discussing Robert Jordan's 'Wheel of Time'  series with a customer, but still hadn't unpacked yesterday's delivery.  They seemed to think that promotion was a simple award for long service  and could never understand why some young upstart had been promoted  over their head.In Ottakar's, although the booksellers came from  a variety of backgrounds, the one thing they all shared was a genuine  love of books and a morbid fear of having to sit at a desk for eight  hours a day. Bookselling provided a variety of work centred around  something that actually mattered, which was not something that the local  call centre could offer.The last day of Ottakar's, Worthing, before it was converted into a Waterstone'sAt  my branch of Waterstone's (which was probably atypical) in the early 90s, the attitude  was more cynical. The staff had no loyalty to the company and regarded  their jobs as a temporary expedient. They might enthuse over certain  titles, but the idea of being passionate about all books would have been viewed as absurd. Indeed, neatly hidden away at the till point was a small sticker that said \"Books are crap\".However,  in their own way, the arrogant slackers of the early Waterstone's years  were often very good booksellers. Freed from the constraints of the  career ladder, completely indifferent to the concerns of area managers,  they ordered what they liked. One buyer was chastised by his manager for  buying ten copies of a £100 Ansel Adams book, but they all sold within  daysFifteen years on, the new owners of Waterstone's were keen  to turn their backs on an era in which the easiest way to identify a  member of staff was to look for the scruffiest person in the shop.  Graduates were no longer essential. The main qualification was a passion  for selling. To the horror of many, a couple of managers had been  recruited from Gap and Burger King!There was a clear message: we don't think bookish people are always good at selling. In today's tough commercial climate, we need proper retailers.(This YouTube video  is a brilliant satire of Borders and the pre-Daunt Waterstone's - sadly  embedding has been disabled, so follow the link and skip the advert  after five seconds)In my darker moments, I wondered if they were  right. Perhaps the traditional booksellers were just unemployable  misfits who'd enjoyed years of sanctuary in the book trade. However,  after three years of 'retailing', with planograms, loyalty cards and a staff training scheme called 'Get Selling', Waterstone's was on its knees and almost disappeared from the high street, until a Russian oligarch came along and bought the company from HMV.Today,  things have come full circle. Unable to compete on price, booksellers  are returning to their traditional role as curators of the huge,  bewildering range of books in print. However good Amazon is, they will  never be able to match the fiction-in-translation table at the Brighton  branch of Waterstone's.During the next decade, many bookshops  will go to the wall - that much is certain - and booksellers will become  an endangered, exotic species. However, the best bookshops should  survive (high street landlords permitting).But to return to the initial question: who becomes a bookseller? Looking  back over 20 years of bookselling, I don't think I could say that there  was a typical bookseller. There were some quiet, bookish types (who  often left to train as librarians), but there were also louche  bohemians, alcoholics, artists, drug dealers, ex-nuns, former policemen,  future policemen, writers, rock musicians, reiki therapists, scientists  and poker players.Misfits. All very different, but all round pegs that didn't fit into  square holes. With fewer bookshops on the horizon, things are going to  get much harder."},

But it seems that this sort of thing wasn't unusual in the 1970s.I found this 1975 ITV handbook recently:Published by the Independent Broadcasting Authority, it's a wonderful snapshot of commercial broadcasting in Britain during 1974, packed full of articles and photos (with a nerdtastic section on IBA transmitter stations).It also clearly shows that television execs in the 1970s had an unhealthy obsession with dance, including this:And this:And this:And this:And even this:What was going on? Did they think that people really wanted to see this, or was it just cheap television?In 1974, I was in bed by eight o'clock, so I missed the worst excesses of this obsession with dancing. However, I do have vague memories of men in trouser suits poncing around to Up, Up and Away, along with the occasional 'rock opera' (which my parents always turned off in disgust because the cast looked as if they were on drugs).The BBC's hands weren't entirely clean either: Seaside Special, The Rolf Harris Show and just about any other live entertainment show had some awful dance group (naturally I exclude the gorgeous Pan's People from this diatribe).At least today, dancing is restricted to a small core of programmes, for those who like that sort of thing. Also, those grim, po-faced contemporary dance groups, who did things like depict the Jarrow Crusade through the medium of movement, have now been replaced by streetdance and hip hop.So next time you find yourself complaining that television isn't what it used to be, buy a boxed set of Homeland and look at this listing for BBC1 on April 16th, 1975.  1230 - Day and Night, including Crime Line.   1255 - News   1300 - Pebble Mill, including Family Advice with Claire Rayner.   1345 - Fingerbobs   1400 - Closedown   1558 - Regional News (Except London/SE)   1600 - Play School   1625 - Boris the Bold   1635 - Jackanory, with Judy Dench   1650 - The Monkees   1715 - If You Were Me (new series).

{"title": "Homage to the Sales Rep, Part Two - From Our Northern Correspondent", "date": "Friday, April 06, 2012", "text": "Many thanks to those who tweeted links to my last post. I had no idea  that a rambling tribute to the humble sales rep would provoke such a  response. One comment, posted by a former colleague of mine, was so long  that Blogger had a brainstorm and rejected it. Fortunately, he saved  the text and emailed it to me.I have reproduced it here, without permission, because it's far too good to languish in the obscurity of my email inbox.Born 17 years before me, Mr X experienced the golden age of the book trade, when booksellers only had their wits and a micofiche to rely on. In those days, there was no '3 for 2' nonsense (a book cost what it said on the cover, so you could like it or lump it) and sales were achieved through good bookselling alone. How things have changed.I'm not sure if Mr X wishes me to reveal his identity, but I have provided two visual clues for those in the know: \"What a  wonderful post, Steerforth – and how brilliantly you capture the dogged  spirit, essential kindness and serial eccentricity of reps. Your piece  set me thinking of my own start in bookselling an age ago in the ‘60s. I had washed  up in Oxford after a failure to return the foetid hug of library school  in the hot Summer of Love. Well, what would you have done in  Aberystwyth in 1967? Bibliography and Classification at Llanbadarn Fawr  or the beach, the Beatles and boy oh boy at Borth?    Clue No.1  My  brother lived in Oxford and I had run there, away from my parents’  searing disapproval of my throwing away a decent living. They had seen a  good career for me among the card files and date stamps of the West  Riding County Library at Wakefield. Naturally I finished up in  Blackwell’s.  Time  passed and I found myself running the General Books Department in what  was then undoubtedly one of the world’s greatest bookshops. Almost  immediately, General became regarded as a dark ravine of insistent  vulgarity, overshadowed by the high mountains of fine academic provision  which surrounded it. I was unbelievably crass and ignorant when I  began. I knew I wanted things to change. After all, not long before, we  had been told to sell the 6 subscribed copies of Portnoy’s Complaint from behind the counter.  Around  the same time, a huge debate among my seniors resulted in a decision  that 36 copies of the first complete paperback edition of Lord of the Rings would suffice to meet the demand from town and gown. Things could only get better.  And  this is where the reps came in. Only they weren’t called that. They  were never called that. They were “travellers”. The qualifying  “gentleman” was invisible but implied. It was indeed exclusively a  masculine world. They tended to be tall, well-made men, red faced and  often with moustaches which betrayed their forces backgrounds. They  almost certainly, you felt, had had a good war. They were kindly and  tolerant. They weren’t in any hurry. They knew what they knew.  Clue No.2  Goodness  knows, by contrast, what they made of me – but they steered me and  persuaded me and educated me so subtly that I often believed I was the  absolute dog’s until I thought back over how I’d got from A to B.  They  all stayed in the Eastgate Hotel on the High. Soon after 9 in the  morning and lugging unfeasibly huge cases of samples, they would come  plodding through Turl Street and into the Broad to begin the day’s  subbing among the myriad BHB departments.  Most  often, they represented individual publishing houses which in today’s  world are mere imprints swallowed into the maw of this conglomerate or  that. So Methuen was in the charge of T. Houston Fraser, a man of huge  majesty and massive dignity; almost Beach the Butler come to life.  Pitman was sold by Stanley Branwhite, who, I now see, displayed  unmistakeable overtones of Ray Winstone. When he was President of the  BPRA and presiding over the dinners which were commonplace then, Stanley  would rise at regular intervals to “take wine” with each of his many  cronies scattered across the room.Reg  Fisk travelled for Collins and I never met anyone more determined to  repeat every word of every AI (Advance Information) in his possession (or die trying). As I  later discovered, it was a Collins trait. Pat Seyd of Harrap had been in  the navy on the Arctic convoys. He unfailingly wore a pinstripe and  bowler hat combination in winter and a straw boater and white suit in  summer. Stanley Nebel represented Macmillan and more than once brought  with him a “learner” – an improbably gangly young American called Nigel  Newton.Bob  Kemp carried Weidenfeld. He’d fought the Mau Mau in Kenya, so staring  down Geoffrey Boycott and shutting him up in the Saraceno in Magdalen  Street was a cakewalk by comparisons. Bob was a Mancunian but nobody’s  perfect. John Oliver of Hamish Hamilton once asked me if he was boring  me (he was). I blush with shame to think of it. Patrick Stephens, who  represented his eponymous list, wore the air of an avuncular don  indulging a promising student.  Alas, alas – they all (apart of course from Nigel) lie in Mellstock Churchyard now.  I  am so glad that you mentioned John, the unspeakably difficult Random  House rep. God forgive me for banning him from the Ottakar’s High  Wycombe store in the 1990s. He had taken to wandering the back offices  at will and in an inspired period had begun unpacking designated returns  and putting them back on the shop selves, replacing them with other  books (sometimes not his own) which he didn’t think we should be  selling. I might have remembered that he was also the man who delivered a  six-foot cardboard standing figure of a star author to a central London  bookshop by taking it on a bus and paying its fare.  It  does seem that the old race of independent ‘ornery reps who often hated  their bosses but loved their customers has gone. The last vestige I  remember was the fabulous gritty Yorkshireman “Dump Bin Dave,” who came  in with the Arrow side of Random House to Ottakar’s in Northallerton.Dave  made all his appointments 12 months ahead and, as his nickname  suggests, was fond of bulk sales. His inevitable sign-off after a  subbing session was in the form of an “Ah just can’t wait…” statement,  reminding me of the sheer irresistibility of his lead title. Some of  these tended to be less convincing than others. I managed to restrain  complete hysterics when he inflicted “Ah just can’t wait ta gerrome and  start that new Oomberto Eco bewk.” This sounds snobbish as I tell it. It  isn’t at all. But it was funny.  Dave is happily working on Leeds Market now. They don’t make them like that anymore.\"Many thanks to Mr X for unintentionally writing this guest post. Here's a photo he might recognise:"},
{"title": "Homage to the Sales Rep", "date": "Friday, March 30, 2012", "text": "In an earlier post I wrote about my first year in bookselling and  casually mentioned that every publisher's sales rep' used to be called  Brian or Keith. Naturally, this was a slight exaggeration. There was also  one called Barry.When I joined Waterstone's, over 20 years ago,  I was told that one of my jobs would involve buying new titles from  publishers. Surprisingly, there was no training, but in spite of this I  was given a monthly budget of £5000 to spend in any way I pleased.  Unsurprisingly, when the word got out that Waterstone's had delegated  its new title buying to a load of chinless wonders, it was like a  feeding frenzy.One of the first things that impressed me was how  many sales reps there were. HarperCollins alone had four, just for SW London (one for  fiction, another for children's, one for general non-fiction, plus a  dedicated rep for maps and reference), whilst most of the other major  publishers had at least two.If you only had one sales representative  per region, you weren't a proper publisher.As a result, I probably spent around 60% of my time buying new titles from sales reps, during meetings that were called 'subbing' sessions. Until I reached the dizzy heights of management, all new title buying had to take place on the shop floor, so we usually tucked ourselves away in a quiet corner where we wouldn't be bothered by customers.Each representative turned up with at least one large suitcase containing huge files of blad  (which stands for book layout and design), showing mock-ups of  dustjackets, blurbs and details of how much publicity the book was going  to get. My job was to decide whether the book would sell in Richmond  and, if I thought it would, guess how many copies we'd need.Initially, I had no idea what I was talking about and the whole buying  process seemed farcical. Some reps saw a golden opportunity for a stitch-up, convincing  me that an obscure £35 book on dolphins warranted a minimum order of  five copies. The more experienced reps took a longer view, knowing that  any duds would only come back as returns, which would have to be  credited back to the bookseller.The best reps effectively taught me how to do my job, gently nudging me in the right direction if I'd overestimated how many books we needed. I had the good sense to listen to them, but not everyone did. When one young bookseller stubbornly refused to accept that he needed five rather than 40 copies of a new poetry title, the rep slammed his folder shut and said \"Look, I'm going to go away now. I'll come back when I can talk to a grown-up.\"The second thing that impressed  me about the reps was how few of them read books. You would imagine that  if a publisher employed people to sell its titles, they would try to  recruit bookish, literary types. However, the majority of the 'old  school' reps had no interest in books and would have been just as happy  selling exhaust pipes or photocopiers.There seemed to be very  strong class divisions in the traditional publishing world. The public  school, university-educated types went into the editorial departments,  whilst the vulgar business of actually selling the books was left to people who had mostly left school at 16.At  first it seemed absurd that publishers had a sales force made up of  people who didn't know that George Eliot was a woman, but over time I  came to realise that the best sales reps were frequently the Brians and  Barrys, who didn't read, whilst the worst were often the bright young  things who may have had English degrees, but didn't know how to sell a book.In the early 1990s, the typical rep was a man in his mid 50s, with a bald head, moustache and a  ruddy face that indicated an approaching heart attack. I lost count of the number of times I heard the phrase \"Keith won't be in for a while - he's just had a heart attack\" (I suppose it was all those 'Little Chef' meals). When he arrived, panting with the effort of dragging a suitcase from the car park, I never knew whether he'd make it to the end of the session.Keith may not have been  widely read, but he knew his market. He understood that X sold well in Windsor  but not in Slough, whilst Y was unknown outside the M25. Sadly,  the editorial departments rarely seemed to take of notice of their reps'  sales reports and a large part of our buying session would be spent  moaning about our respective head offices. \"Honestly Phil, you tell me, how am I going to sell this? They haven't got a clue.\"It  was a working-class, male-dominated world. Hours were spent on the  road, so the car was king and each rep knew every service station and  shortcut. If you wanted to get rid of a rep, giving them an Austin Montego was usually enough.Some of the reps had little scams that made them feel that they  were getting the upper hand over their unsympathetic employers. For  example, when one rep went to get petrol, his wife followed him in her  car and filled her tank during the same sesion (when someone challenged the rep about his fuel costs, he brazened it out: \"It's a thirsty car mate\").Occasionally, a bright young thing at head office would try to get the reps more engaged with the titles they were representing:\"Phil,  I got this fucking memo from some tosser at Head Office telling me I  had to read this new novel and write a report about it! D'you know what I  did? I phoned him up and said I haven't read a fucking book in 25 years  and I'm not going to start now.\"But  not all of the reps were 'wide boys'. One was an ex-public school  man in his 60s, who lived in an expensive London flat with his belligerent, alcoholic mother. In spite  of his effete manner and Brian Sewell voice, he was at pains to let us  know that he was heterosexual, constantly praising the feminine charms  of detox guru Leslie Kenton:When it came to Alan Hollinghurst, he was less enthusiastic:\"This is a book by a homosexual author that will only be of interest to other homosexuals\".He wasn't terribly keen on Irvine Welsh either:\"Here is another book for young people to waste their pocket money on\".It  was all said with a faint twinkle in the eye, but I felt that he  was a rather bitter, disappointed man, trapped in a world he despised. When he was forced to retire, he refused to accept the gold-plated fountain pen that his colleagues had bought for him.But by the  time I became a bookseller, the traditional reps' world was changing. The Keiths were increasingly being replaced, either by Sues (much to the relief of many female booksellers) or earnest young graduates and the subbing sessions - once a mixture of dirty jokes, gossip and moaning - became more businesslike in tone.Overall I got on very  well with the sales reps and came to regard some of them as friends. They  were generally bright, funny people with a healthy cynicism about the  publishing industry and, most important of all, a good sense of humour. When I left high-street bookselling, one of the things I really missed was having a good gossip with a rep.I loved exchanging scurrilous anecdotes about colleagues. I learned that one Ottakar's manager regularly had pyjama-party sleepovers in her shop, whilst another had stolen enough money to buy a sports car (he ended up in prison). But my favourite gossip was about authors. I learned that Jilly Cooper was lovely but Jeffrey Archer was deeply unpleasant, whilst Terry Pratchett could be very grumpy, only turning on the charm for his fans.If a sales rep had ever been treated badly by an author, we all knew about it. In a few cases, an author's career was effectively killed off by the rep, as we all conspired to make sure that their books were barely visible.The  rep's job has got a lot harder in recent years. Every year, redundancies and early  retirement have trimmed the sales forces of publishers and the surviving  reps have been expected to cover ever larger areas for little or no extra pay. The once ubiquitous HarperCollins rep is now as elusive as the natterjack toad.With only one major book chain left, the age of the publisher's rep is almost over. I think that there should be a memorial coat of arms, depicting a full English breakfast, some blood pressure tablets and a large black suitcase on wheels. But sadly, I think their passing will be unnoticed by all but a few."},
{"title": "Light and Shade", "date": "Wednesday, March 28, 2012", "text": "During the last few days, our oven has exploded, the fridge has broken and my car's dashboard keeps flashing an orange light, warning of imminent doom. It feels as if we're in a Stephen King movie. As far as I know, there are no Native American burial grounds under our house, but we're near the site of the Battle of Lewes, so perhaps some tormented medieval souls are making their presence felt.This morning I took the car to be serviced and walked home, cutting through some of the many twittens that are tucked away behind the main roads. Because it was so early, the sun was still low and I was struck by the contrast between the intense, golden light of the castle walls and the gloomy, muted colours of the narrow twittens.I don't normally walk around thinking about light and shade, but last night I went to a fascinating talk about Eric Ravilious, given by author (and blogger) James Russell. Organised by the wonderful Much Ado Books, it was so successful that the venue had to be to changed to a larger place.I'd say that there were at least 150 people at the talk - a number that any bookseller would be very happy with. Even the largest city centre stores struggle to achieve figures like that, so it's remarkable that an independent bookshop in a small Sussex village attracted such a good turnout.It's a great tribute to both the growing popularity of Eric Ravilious  and the marketing skills of Much Ado Books and James Russell.I seemed to be the only person there under 50. I'm not quite sure why, although I know how difficult it is to do anything in the evening if you're in the tunnel of parenthood. Perhaps Banksy would have drawn a different crowd.As for the talk itself, I think it would have been interesting even if I'd never heard of Eric Ravilious, thanks to James Russell's passion about his subject. Using a series of slides, he showed the contrast between Ravilious's paintings and the actual scenes. To a layman like me, it was a revelation.For example, here is a lithograph that Ravilious made of Newhaven Harbour:And here is the actual scene, which I've pinched from James Russell's blog:I had no idea that Ravilous had excercised his artistic licence so liberally, compressing distances and altering the perspective to suit his purposes. That is one of the things that makes him a great artist, along with his ability to capture the spiritual quality of a place:For example, compare this watercolour by Ravilious of the South Downs in winter:With this traditional downland scene by a contemporary artist:Perhaps my favourite Ravilious painting is 'Dangerous Work at Low Tide', which comes from the final years of his life when he was an official war artist. I bought a 420mm x 594mm print from the Ministry of Defence for the ridiculously cheap price of £18.If this takes your fancy, you can buy it here.Even if you only have a very casual interest in the art of the interwar years, I'd strongly recommend getting along to one of James Russell's talks. Recent venues have included London, Oxford and Bristol, so it's worth checking his blog to see where he's off to next.Finally, a quick plug for Much Ado Books. The owners - Kate Olsen and Nash Robbins - ran a successful bookshop in Marblehead, Massachusetts for over 20 years before moving to Alfriston in Sussex. When 'Much Ado' first opened, I confidently predicted that they'd close within two years because Alfriston was too small to sustain a bookshop.Instead, they went on to win the Independent Bookseller of the Year award and now have a thriving business which is an object lesson in how to run a bookshop in the age of Amazon and ebooks. It just shows how much I know.In hindsight, they followed one of the golden rules of bookselling: open a shop where there are lots of posh people. Alfriston may be small, but it has a wonderful catchment area full of literary types who think that buying books at discounted prices from Amazon is insufferably vulgar. The owners have successfully exploited the area's Bloomsbury connection and both the stock and presentation are pitch perfect. It's hard to believe that they're relative newcomers to Sussex.On April 22nd they're holding a book swap, hosted by Scott 'Me and My Big Mouth' Pack and Robert Husdon. The idea is that you bring a book that you love along and swap it for one you haven't read.Frankly, if I love a book, I'm buggered if I'm going to let anyone else have it. I don't even lend books, so I'm not sure whether I'll go or not. Perhaps I could bring a book I'm not that keen on and pretend to like it, but I suppose that really isn't entering into the spirit of the occasion.On the subject of books, I almost forgot to mention why James Russell was holding an event with Much Ado Books. He's written some books - beautiful, lavishly-illustrated hardbacks - that focus on different aspects of Ravilious's art. Here's one I bought earlier:I wouldn't be tactless enough to include an Amazon link, but they are available from all good booksellers and, no doubt, some bad ones too."},
{"title": "This Evening", "date": "Monday, March 26, 2012", "text": "This evening I decided to take advantage of the extra hour of daylight and go for what the Victorians used to call a perambulation. It was a lovely evening - almost t-shirt weather - and the sound of birdsong and horses hooves made me feel as if I was in an episode of Midsomer Murders, without the murders.It almost made up for an otherwise shitty day, during which my wife and I decided to pull our oldest son out of the school system.It has taken me a while to realise what a difficult time we've had. I've known several people with autistic children and compared to them, our life was a breeze, so I think I turned a blind eye to the fact that my son struggled to cope with normal, everyday situations and I kept looking for easy answers.It was confusing. My son doesn't neatly fit into any category, but exhibits symptoms of several syndromes. Sometimes I think he has something that hasn't been named yet. At others I'm more inclined to agree with R D Laing's view that mental illness is a social construct (I'm not denying the existence of full-blown nutters, but there is a general consensus that neurotic and psychotic illnesses are exacerbated by modern, urban life).Would my son's behaviour be regarded as problematic if we lived in a traditional community? Judging by his skill at computer games, he'd be an excellent hunter-gatherer.It does feel as if we're in a big sausage machine sometimes, where people are sucked into a system that squeezes them into the right shape so that they can function in a modern, urban, post-industrial society, and if you're a square peg in a round hole, then you're diagnosed with a syndrome.I don't know; I feel more confused than ever. If I hadn't had a second child I might have gone to my grave thinking that I was one of the most useless fathers in existence, but my younger son is completely different. Indeed, if he'd been my only child I might have been unbearably conceited.I've met those smug parents who seem to delight in telling you how Lily or Hector love visiting the Tate Modern (when they're not busy having viola lessons) and then go on to show you the Matisse-influenced drawings they did when they got home. It always gives me a huge sense of satisfaction when they have a second child who turns out to be a complete 'mentalist': welcome to my world,.I'm not quite sure what's going to happen next. Obviously my son's education is important, but his mental health comes first. Getting him out of the front door is the first challenge (and I think that getting a dog may be the answer), after which I hope that my son will rediscover his curiosity about the world around him.Meanwhile, his brother is downstairs doing maths games and designing a birthday card for his former childminder. His only worries seem to center around the number of people who want to be his friend. Also, the schoolwork isn't challenging enough.Life is such a lottery.PS - Feb 2013. Almost one year on, I can see that the decision to remove our son from school was the right one.  The last eleven months have been a struggle, but there has been a gradual, steady improvement that fills us with hope."},
{"title": "Somerset Maugham Talking About Novelists", "date": "Saturday, March 24, 2012", "text": "\"All novels are, every now and then, a great deal of a bore. You have to accept that. No novel is interesting all the way through unless it's a very, very short one.\"You wouldn't expect to find a YouTube clip of an author born in 1874 talking about a book he'd published in 1915. But Somerset Maugham had the good fortune to live a long life, whilst writers like D H Lawrence (born 11 years after Maugham) seem as remote as Thomas Hardy.Here's an interview that Maugham did with the wonderfully effete Malcolm Muggeridge. The sound is slightly out of synch with the video:Somerset Maugham's longevity was probably a result of good genes and living in the south of France, but there may have been another factor too. According to Clement Freud, Maugham was \"obsessed with staying alive and spent most of his later years averting death, which included the consumption of a range of pills including some made from the entrails of swan\".Freud also noted that Maugham had the worst halitosis he had ever encountered.Fortunately YouTube is still several years away from providing odourama, so we can enoy this close-up encounter with Somerset Maugham without holding our breath."},

After years of working regular hours for a set number of days per week, it feels strange to not know what you're doing from one day to the next.On Monday I received a text from someone that read:\"Hi Phil, I'm in the process of designing a bookshop and could use some helpful input. I think you're probably the man - what do you reckon?\" 24 hours later I was wandering around a huge, deserted haberdashery shop, trying to imagine how it would work as a bookshop. I wasn't sure whether I'd be much use, but I'd forgotten how much I'd learned. Years of opening shops, ordering stock and trawling through spreadsheets of sales data had given me a good overview of the priorities.I made a few suggestions, including moving the till point closer to the entrance, putting the children's books nearer the back and reducing the opening stock order by 80%, but I couldn't bring myself to make the most obvious recommendation. Don't do it!According to an article published in today's Bookseller, \"Four in ten shops will shut and property portfolios will reduce by  30-40% in the next five years as customers increasingly turn to online  shopping over bricks and mortar, according to a report released this  morning\".It's not a good time to open a shop.I'm fairly confident that the best independent bookshops will survive if they have a good catchment area, but sadly this shop wasn't in one of those towns. Indeed, when I looked at the shabbily-dressed locals, slowly hobbling past the window, it reminded me of an episode of The Walking Dead.Luckily the rent is very low, so the shop will only have to sell a few books a day to be profitable. Also, the owner is a very talented bookseller with several successful businesses, so he knows exactly what he's doing. But I still think that it takes a tremendous amount of courage to open a shop in today's economic climate.According to Hugo Clark from Deloitte's, \"The role of stores is changing but that does not mean they will be less  important. The store of the future will be less about driving product  sales and more about a holistic brand experience.\"I think if my name was Hugo, I'd refrain from using phrases like 'holistic brand experience' as people will think that you're a bit of a ponce. But he's right. I think that the retail chains of the future will make most of their money online and only need a small number of stores as showcases for their 'brand'.It all sounds a bit depressing, but with fewer chain stores around we could be about to enter a new golden age of small businesses and independent shops.I'll come clean; I want to see Britain end up like an episode of Chigley and if the recession brings us any closer to the promised land, then I welcome the retail meltdown.

{"title": "My First Year in Bookselling", "date": "Thursday, March 15, 2012", "text": "Sometimes  I find it hard to believe that I spent the best part of 18 years  working in bookshops. Where did all the time go? It's not as if I  particularly wanted to be a bookseller. I just needed a job and my girlfriend told  me  that there was a vacancy in a new shop called Waterstone's. I'd never heard of them.I got the job after an interview with a woman with shaking hands, who already seemed tired and disillusioned with her new shop. It was hard to tell whether she thought I was vaguely employable or irredeemably dreadful, but eventually she cracked a strained smile and talked about a start date. I  was offered a starting salary of £7,250 p/a, rising to £7,500 if I  completed my three month probationary period.Even 20 years ago, if you earned less than  £10,000 a year, your options in life were pretty limited. With such awful pay, the job could only be a useful stopgap. It certainly wasn't a sensible career choice.Sadly, I didn't have a Plan B and my Damascene moment never came. Some booksellers passed through the shop like gap year backpackers in Goa, taking a breather before going on to enjoy successful careers in television or publishing. I stayed and became Colonel Kurtz.I spent the early 1990s at Waterstone's in Richmond - an affluent suburb of London that was quickly changing from 'old money'  into a ghetto for post-apartheid South African exiles, US  business execs and semi-retired rock stars (I think my mother was the  last working class person to grow up in Richmond - there should be some  sort of plaque on her old house).Starting at Waterstone's was a  baptism of fire. I wasn't particularly well-read in those days and each shift was like being on Mastermind, except that the  rounds lasted for three hours at a time and you weren't allowed to make a  mistake or say \"Pass\".Some people actually shouted at me because I  hadn't heard of the book that they wanted. Others merely resorted to sarcasm,  or barely-concealed contempt. At first it was deeply humiliating, but as  my knowledge and confidence grew, I realised that it was quiet unreasonable for people to expect me to be omniscient. I noticed  that a lot of older people seemed to resent the young and welcomed the  opportunity to bully them. Men in their 60s would regularly chastise our  18-year-old Saturday girl for her poor general knowledge of minor politicians of the 1950s, forgetting  that they had lived at least four times as long. Middle-aged women expected me to  be their gimp, running up and down the three flights of  stairs until I'd reached the bottom of their long lists (sadly the demands stopped there).The worst were the South African women, dripping in gold, with vulgar Gucci sunglasses and rottweiler accents: \"Yeess, Ah'm wanting to know if you hev eeny books bah theess lady?\"  The answer was always Jackie Collins, but even if the book was staring  them in the face, it seemed to go against the grain for them to do  anything for themselves.Every day was a struggle, but luckily I  picked the job up quite quickly and learned to talk with great authority  on subjects that I knew nothing about. I also realised that I had a  knack for making sure that we didn't run out of the bestselling titles  (harder than it sounds when publishers took up to three weeks to  deliver and there were no computerised stock control systems).But perhaps  the most important lesson I learned was how to answer back in a way  that wouldn't get me the sack. Once people could no longer smell the  fear, they treated me with respect and I began to enjoy my job more.Interestingly,  the really successful people - whether they were famous authors like  Anthony Burgess or celebrities like Mick Jagger - were unfailingly  polite. It was the noveau riche who were a pain in the arse. They were usually quite thick as well, but felt that their wealth conferred a natural superiority.Anthony Burgess. One of my colleagues dared me to tell him how much I enjoyed his 'Chocolate Orange', but I chickened out.For some reason that I couldn't fathom, the most ghastly people always bought Ayn Rand or The Art of War, whilst the dippy ones couldn't get enough of A Year in Provence. I tried hard not show my contempt for people's book choices, but when one Tim-Nice-But-Dim customer held up a copy of The Bridges of Madison County and said \"This is wonderful, isn't it...\" I cracked and launched into a Bernard Black-style diatribe.Apparently the poor man left the shop looking as if he'd been horribly violated. I'm amazed he didn't complain. During  my first year at Waterstone's, I quickly discovered that bookshops were  magnets for eccentrics, kleptomaniacs and the mentally ill - and that  was just the staff (the most audacious book thief was a man called  Desmond who decided that the most efficient way of stealing stock was to  become a bookseller). We also had a loyal following of lost souls who  spent so much time in the shop that their stock knowledge easily  equalled ours.In many ways bookselling left a lot to be desired. The  money was terrible, working with the public was exhausting and the shift  system meant that many evenings and weekends were wasted. However, the best parts of the job more than  compensated for the irritations. I loved having the freedom to spend  vast sums of money buying new titles from publishers' reps (all of whom  seemed to be called Brian or Keith), taking a punt on an unknown author  or range, only to find that I'd spotted a new trend, like the Aga saga craze. In my first year at  Waterstone's, two buying decisions alone paid for my salary.Trying to look busy, waiting for the self-timer to go offI also loved meeting authors and publishers, deciphering the complex  web of friendships and petty rivalries between people in the book  world. I never read reviews in the same light once I realised how many  of them were written by friends reviewing each others' books.Sometimes  I even liked working with the public - usually on a quiet evening when  there was time to talk to customers, find out what they liked and make  recommendations. Seeing people enjoy the shop, relaxing in an armchair  with a book from a new display I'd created was very rewarding.The  first year passed quickly. 12 months on I still had no idea what I  wanted to do and although I hated being poor, I realised that I loved  my job. The books were interesting, my colleagues were bright, funny  people and I felt that I was quite good at what I did.Some of the staff of Waterstone's Richmond, on Brighton PierI stayed. The money gradually improved and by the time I was a  manager in London, I was able to afford a mortgage, meals out and a  decent holiday every year. It didn't last. I ruined it all by having children and  leaving London. I have lived in penury ever since.I'd probably still be managing a bookshop  now, if HMV hadn't bought Ottakar's. But I'm very glad I left. I don't think that  I could ever go back to working weekends, dealing with the public and  putting up with head office edicts any more. Once you've tasted freedom,  it's hard to go back.However I miss the fun: the buzz of a crowded  shop on the last Saturday before Christmas, meeting old friends at  drunken book launches and having a good bitch with the publishers' sales  reps. I don't think there's much fun in the book trade any more, so  perhaps I was lucky to get out while I did.How many other jobs give you the opportunity to play with wigs, make-up and live snakes?"},
{"title": "Somerset Maugham and a Book Title I Daren't Mention", "date": "Tuesday, March 13, 2012", "text": "I've been feeling under the weather for a while - nothing specific, just aches and pains, lethargy and a general feeling of wrongness. I put it down to stress, working outdoors in the cold or, perhaps, simply middle age beginning to claim its stake.I carried on as usual, relying on siestas in the afternoon to deal with the tiredness and a few glasses of wine in the evening to dull the pain. But last week I started to feel pretty rough and decided to visit my GP for some reassurance.I suppose I was hoping to see an old-fashioned doctor - the sort who still occasionally work as locums, call you \"old chap\" and say things like \"Nothing to worry about, but keep the golf clubs in the boot for a couple of weeks. If the pain starts to niggle, have a small brandy at bedtime\". Instead, I had a woman who looked horrified and used phrases like \"Actually, that's really bad\".After five minutes of watching her pull yikes! faces, I was convinced that I wasn't long for this world. When I discovered that it was just pneumonia, I felt a huge sense of relief.I've now spent five days in bed and instead of wasting my time watching YouTube clips of the Jeremy Kyle Show (I never set out to watch them, but whether I begin with chimpanzees or the Hadron Collider, it always seems to lead back to Jeremy Kyle), I've been reading Of Human Bondage. After some rather unfortunate experiences, I decided not to use the novel's title for this post.I'd never read Somerset Maugham before. I associated him with that group of early 20th century British second-rate writers - Bennett, Walpole and Galsworthy - whose novels were incredibly popular in their day but are now regarded as dated, with turgid prose and half-baked philosophies. Even Maugham himself seemed to agree with this view: \"I am in the front row of second-raters\".But by chance I came across the customer reviews for Of Human Bondage on Amazon and was so impressed by the passion Maugham's novel had inspired in its readers (nearly everyone gave the book five stars) I decided to give it a go.I'm normally a slow reader, but managed to devour all 729 pages of Maugham's bildungsroman in a weekend. Admittedly I was stuck in bed, but if I'd picked up a Joseph Conrad novel I would have soon been reaching for the remote control. Instead, I was fully immersed in the London of the 1890s, walked its streets, sat in its parks and jostled amongst the crowds at the music hall.Of Human Bondage (Wikipedia link included because I don't intend to discuss the plot) is Maugham's masterpiece. The prose may lack the stylistic perfection of Virginia Woolf or James Joyce, but it is a powerful novel of ideas that, with its musings on absurdism, anticipates existentialist works like Nausea and The Myth of Sisyphus.Throughout the narrative, the main character regularly asks himself if  there can really be any meaning to existence. Everywhere he looks,  people lead lives of quiet tragedy, defeated by overwhelming odds, with any last vestiges of hope crushed by the final acceptance of their own ineluctable mediocrity (if only they'd had blogging in those days).If that sounds all rather maudlin, don't be put off. Above all, Of Human Bondage is a compelling story and unlike that other great chronicler of late Victorian London, George Gissing, it isn't relentless gloomy.A typical George Gissing sceneMaugham doesn't shy away from any unpalatable truths and some passages must have shocked its readers in 1915, but he avoids unnecessarry melodrama and resolves the novel with a conclusion that won't leave you banging your head against the wall.Somerset Maugham has never been popular with the critics. Even at the height of his career, Maugham's plain, conventional prose was compared unfavourably to the work of new modernist writers like Thomas Mann and William Faulkner. But although Of Human Bondage may not be stylistically innovative, its sheer weight of ideas, the integrity of its narrative and the strength of its characters make it, in my opinion, a masterpiece.Sadly, Somerset Maugham's greatest novel doesn't appear on any of the recent 100 best books lists that appear with an ever increasing frequency. It doesn't even pop up on readers' choices, eclipsed by masterpieces like The Da Vinci Code and Bridget Jones' Diary. That's why I'm adding my small stone to the cairn.If you harbour any secret time travel fantasies about going back to late Victorian London, this is the nearest you'll get. Of Human Bondage is a panorama of a society in transition during the fin de siecle: outwardly stable, but driven by undercurrents that are threatening long-held views on religion, gender and class. Maugham's descriptions of the streets, cafes and railway stations are so vivid that you will feel as if you've been there.Like most great novels, Of Human Bondage vividly conveys its time, but never seems dated because it asks questions and makes observations that are as pertinent today as they were 100 years ago. For example, one passage, in which Maugham describes a dance hall, could almost be lifted word for word to describe a modern club and the desperate hedonism of its users, anxious to forget the tedium of their daily lives.As with many novels of this period, Somerset Maugham does occasionally get on his soapbox. There's the usual stuff about sex, money and the Church of England; but unlike H G Wells' incredibly tedious novel The New Machiavelli, he doesn't allow his pontificating to spoil the narrative.Of Human Bondage is a great novel to read when you're ill or on a long journey. But frankly, why wait?Sample quotes from On Human Bondage:It is an illusion that youth is happy, an illusion of those who have  lost it; but the young know they are wretched for they are full of the  truthless ideal which have been instilled into them, and each time they  come in contact with the real, they are bruised and wounded.When I read a book I seem to read it with my eyes only, but now and then  I come across a passage, perhaps only a phrase, which has a meaning for  me, and it becomes part of me.It is cruel to discover one's mediocrity only when it is too late.Like all weak men he laid an exaggerated stress on not changing one's mind.It is not wealth one asks for, but just enough to preserve one's  dignity, to work unhampered, to be generous, frank and independent.It was one of the queer things of life that you saw a person every day  for months and were so intimate with him that you could not imagine  existence without him; then separation came, and everything went on in  the same way, and the companion who had seemed essential proved  unnecessary.You will find as you grow older that the first thing needful to make the  world a tolerable place to live in is to recognize the inevitable  selfishness of humanity. You demand unselfishness from others, which is a  preposterous claim that they should sacrifice their desires to yours.  Why should they? When you are reconciled to the fact that each is for  himself in the world you will ask less from your fellows. They will not  disappoint you, and you will look upon them more charitably.

Regardless of its scientific value, there is a heroic quality about manned space flight that excites us.When the space shuttles were decommissioned without being replaced, it was part of a subtle shift that has taken place in our attitude towards the future. I became particularly aware of this when my youngest son asked me why there were supersonic airliners and moon landings when I was a little boy, but not now.As he was too young for a lecture on postmodernism and the cultural legacy of the end of the Cold War, I gave him the short answer: they cost too much money.But NASA's estimate that a return to the moon would cost $104 billion seems a drop in the ocean compared to the $757.8 billion that the US Department of Defense claims that it spent in Iraq (some claim that it's much higher in reality).Maybe it's just the chattering classes of Lewes (aka 'Islington-on-the-Downs'), but whoever I talk to there is a growing pessimism about the future. People seem to be battening down the hatches, buying wood burning stoves, preparing for an age of hardship and struggle.Returning to the moon might seem a frivilous and irrelevant enterprise, but it would help to foster a new sense of optimism. Posterity never condemns a generation for spending too much money on a beautiful building or a miraculous piece of engineering, but it does condemn them for a lack of vision and courage.That's my geeky fantasy, anyway. Obviously, this would be the ideal:I know that I should be thinking about eradicating third world debt, saving public libraries and reducing our carbon emissions, rather than moonbases run by women in catsuits. I'm sorry.I must admit I not all there at the moment. I've been bedridden with a chest infection for the last three days and I think the drugs are getting to me, hence this strange post. I hate being ill.The one thing that's keeping me sane is Somerset Maugham's 'Of Human Bondage', which I'm reading for the first time. Who would have thought that a 1915, 700-page bildungsroman could be so compelling? (Don't tell me how it ends)But as the author wrote:\"To acquire the habit of reading is to construct for yourself a refuge from almost all the miseries of life\"."},

I was going to listen to Shostakovich and eat borsch, but ended up getting waylaid by some Soviet disco hits from the late 1970s, including this gem:I had no idea that disco fever spread beyond the Iron Curtain, but you'd never get bands this big in the West (with the possible exception of the Love Unlimited Orchestra). It's overmanning. No wonder the Soviet economy collapsed.Beyond the wah-wah guitars and dodgy afros, it's a good old-fashioned gloomy Russian ballad. I can't see the Bee Gees covering this track.It's strange to think that a whole generation have been born and reached adulthood since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The USSR, with its Mayday parades, geriatric politicians and five-year plans feels recent to me, but I've read that many Russian teenagers and children are woefully ignorant about the period.This will tell them all they need to know:Returning to music, I found another gloomy Russian ballad - a wonderful song called  Виски (Whisky) by a contemporary singer called Елена Ваенга (Elena Vaenga).

{"title": "Unravelled", "date": "Sunday, March 04, 2012", "text": "It's been one of those weeks. It started well enough and I was going to write a blog post about a very enjoyable pub crawl along some of the historic riverside inns that lie east of the Tower Bridge, including the Mayflower in Rotherhithe and the Prospect of Whitby in Wapping.I would have probably included these photos:London, through a glass, darklyI might also have mentioned the Prospect of Whitby's literary and artistic associations - Pepys, Turner, Dickens, Whistler and Daniel Farson - along with an incident there in 1996 that wasn't my finest hour.But the week unravelled and by Wednesday, it felt as if several months had gone by. Perhaps I'll write about it one day.In the meantime, some readers may remember this clipping from a couple of years ago, featuring the most 'mature' 13-year-old I've ever seen:I've reposted it because I have a strong feeling that D. Greaves of Middleton is also featured on the cover of this book, which I found last week:I'll zoom in further...It's him, isn't it? The attire may be less formal, but he still looks 43.I wonder what happened to D. Greaves? I tried finding him on Google, but the word 'model' yielded some results that had very little to do with the radio-controlled boat world. It didn't help that he came from a place called Middleton either.It will probably remain a mystery.I wish that I could be one of those people who play with radio-controlled boats at the weekend. Perhaps I'd belong to a local club and talk to fellow enthusiasts and every December we'd have our annual Christmas dinner, during which guest speakers would regale us with amusing anecdotes of exploding boats, lost signals and aggressive swans.I'd sleep soundly at night. I wouldn't worry about my son and I wouldn't give a second thought to Iran's uranium enrichment programme, the continuing economic crisis or any of the other things that flitter through my mind at four o'clock in the morning.But my mind has already raced ahead to the broken marriage caused by an excessive devotion to radio-controlled boats, the unsatisfactory friendship with Vic Smeed and the loneliness of the annual Christmas dinner.Perhaps I'll buy a dog instead."},
{"title": "Taped", "date": "Wednesday, February 29, 2012", "text": "If the terms normal bias, low noise, high precision shell, compact cassette, ferric, high position, chromdioxid, noise reduction, head cleaner, metal bias and C90 mean anything to you, these might appeal:At the time, this seemed the most stylish, zeitgeisty advert around. Could the 21st century be much better than this? With my usual visionary flare, I imagined that slightly smaller, dictaphone-style cassettes might be the norm by 2001. If we were very lucky.For this band I'd buy the dodgiest tape I could find - probably something with a name like 'Supertronic' that could only be obtained at a local market stall - in the hope that the music would become inaudible within four plays.Chrome cassettes were the aristocrats of the tape world, but there was a rumour that they were more abrasive and damaged the tape heads. This worried me greatly at the time.The same rules applied to video recording too:Sadly the Scotch video tapes I bought were rubbish, reducing everything to mid-80s pastels, with the grainy quality of a Betamax Portuguese soft porn film.Thank God for digital. It's so nice to be free of chewed-up cassettes, tape hiss and the seemingly interminable wait for a C-120 to rewind back to the beginning. However, I miss that little wave of pleasure that came when I could afford a TDK AD90, rather than a mere D90."},
{"title": "More Book Covers", "date": "Monday, February 27, 2012", "text": "Here are my favourite book covers from last week:It could be a poster for the Big Society,  with a young David and Samantha Cameron looking rather contemptuously  at the boy from the local slums . Perhaps David is searching for a  bobby: \"Arrest that ruffian constable! He's stealing our snow.\"This  rather downbeat illustration is for a collection of stories about jolly  girls doing plucky things. I think that the girl in the deck chair is  probably saying:\"The notion of  ambiguity must not be confused with that of absurdity. To  declare that  existence is absurd is to deny that it can ever be given a  meaning; to  say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is  never fixed,  that it must be constantly won.\"Or something like that.By  contrast, this angst-free cover looks more like a 1950s glamour  magazine than a children's annual. I think the artist was going beyond  his remit.Annuals may have changed over the years, but the one  thing they had in common was that they were always complete crap. I  remember the huge excitement on Christmas Day when I unwrapped a present  containing an annual of my favourite tv programme, followed by the  crushing disappointment when I realised that the contents were a  selection of dull short stories and some poorly-executed drawings.The next book is rather unusual:Airport  was, of course, one of the most successful thrillers of the late 1960s  and the film adaptation spawned a wave of disaster movies. Arthur  Hailey's novel was a worldwide success, but I didn't realise that there  was also an official Soviet version:\"Order of the Red banner of Labour MILITARY PUBLISHING HOUSE, USSR MINISTRY OF DEFENCE. MOSCOW - 1981\"If  I had to write a list of 20th century novels that might meet with the  approval of the Soviet censor, Airport wouldn't be the first book that  sprang to mind. But given Aeroflot's reputation in the 1980s, perhaps  this was seen as a work of social realism.This copy is in  English, but every page has annotations at the bottom in Cyrillic. I  expect they're ensuring that Mr Hailey's narrative is placed within a  Marxist-Leninist context.Finally, a very different novel from the late 1960s:Apparently, quite a few of the women who appeared on the covers of Richard Brautigan's novels were also his lovers. It's comforting to see that a dodgy haircut and moustache is no obstacle to attracting a beautiful woman:As  writers' lives go, Brautigan's was one of the grimmest. Described by  Thomas McGuane as \"a gentle, troubled, deeply odd guy\", Brautigan shot  himself at the age of 49.His suicide note read: \"Messy, isn't it?\"Perhaps he would have been happier if he'd met a crowd of nice young people:"},

{"title": "The New Elizabethans", "date": "Friday, February 17, 2012", "text": "During a long, dull drive to Mortlake Crematorium yesterday, I listened to a podcast of Radio Four's excellent Start the Week, in which Andrew Marr and his guests discussed a quest to find 60 'New Elizabethans'.I'll let this extract from the Radio Four website explain things further: \"To mark the Diamond Jubilee, James Naughtie will be  profiling the 60 public figures who have made the greatest impact in  these islands during The Queen's reign - men and women who have defined  the era and whose deeds will stand the test of time.    But who are the great achievers of the past six decades? Who will stamp  their names in the history books just as Shakespeare, Drake and Raleigh  did before them?  Who will be remembered down the years for changing the  way we live and think, for entertaining and amazing us?     We'd like your help to find The New Elizabethans. They  can come from any walk of life. Their impact must have been on these  islands between 1952 and the present day but that doesn't necessarily  mean they have to be British.You can suggest your New Elizabethans up to 5pm on March 9th 2012. All  the names put forward will be passed to our panel of leading historians  who will debate and decide on the final list of 60. Radio 4 will  broadcast profiles of each of the chosen New Elizabethans during the  summer this year.\"I know that polls like these are a lot of nonsense, but I can't resist the allure of lists.It's a relief to see that Radio Four aren't putting it to a popular vote (although I trust their listeners more than most people). Let's leave it to the experts. Democracy may work in the polling booth, but it's a lousy arbiter of quality.However, the criteria are a little confusing.The extract above includes anyone who has influenced British culture during the last 60 years, irrespective of nationality. But another Radio Four web page suggests that it should simply be a list of 'Great Britons'.To confuse things further, what do we mean by 'Britons'? In 1953, citizens of Australia, New Zealand and Canada were widely regarded as de facto Britons, which is why Edmund Hillary's conquest of Everest was regarded as a British achievement. Where do we draw the line?Driving home along the M25, I had a long time to think about this and started to come up with some names. I decided to limit my selection to individuals who were either born in Britain or  have lived here for a number of years, as an international list would be  far too difficult to narrow down to 60 people (mine would have to  include figures as diverse as Elvis Presley, Bill Gates, Mikhail  Gorbachev, the person who invented the Sony Walkman, Aaron Spelling,  Milton Friedman and President Kennedy).If I'd had more time, the list might have been very different. But for the moment these are the people who, for better or worse, seem to capture the spirit of the age:  David Attenborough  Margaret Thatcher  Rupert Murdoch  Charles Saatchi  Tim Berners-Lee  Germaine Greer  Paul McCartney  John Lennon  Malcolm McClaren  Delia Smith  Verity Lambert  Jack Cohen  David Beckham  Jacqueline Wilson  Richard Dawkins  Spike Milligan  Richard Branson  Stelios Haji-Ioannou  David Hockney  Mary Quant  Peter Cook  Shirley Williams  Richard Rogers  Andrew Lloyd-Webber  Robert Maxwell  Lew Grade  George Best  Bruce Forsyth  Lawrence Olivier  Diana Rigg  Simon Cowell  George Martin  Ian Fleming  Morrissey  Chris Evans  Princess Diana  Tony Blair  Enid Blyton  Alan Bennett  J K Rowling  Anita Roddick  Vivien Westwood  Patrick Steptoe  Doris Lessing  Michael Caine  Francis Crick  James Watson  Terence Conran  David Bowie  Elton John  Doreen Lawrence  Norman Foster  Mike Leigh  Terry Wogan  Magdi Yacoub   Judi Dench  Prince Charles  David Steel   Arthur Scargill  Tony HancockThere are quite a few names I'd like to remove - Rupert Murdoch, for example - but their influence is undeniable. Each person on this list has either changed or defined the time they lived in.  It's certainly not a 'greatest' list - that would look very different. On mine, writers, artists and poets are thin on the ground because in the age of mass media, I think they've become eclipsed by entertainers and celebrities. Perhaps I should have included figures from reality television too.There are three weeks left until the poll is closed and the great and the good make their decision.I wonder if it's too late for me to put in a bid for Sid James?"},
{"title": "The Wheel of Misfortune", "date": "Thursday, February 09, 2012", "text": "In a recent post, I mentioned my horror of modern working practices like team building exercises and earnest discussions about brand identity. I also mentioned the term 'brand wheel'.Until five years ago, I'd never heard of brand wheels. I'd chosen the relative penury of bookselling so that I would never have to sit in boardrooms, having serious conversations about things that didn't matter. It was an unspoken agreement.Then HMV bought the company I worked for and suddenly books were called 'product', knowledge became 'learnings' and the staff were called 'resource' (always singular, I noticed). The agreement had been broken. It was a horrible time.One day I was invited to a regional meeting and an ambitious young manager revealed a diagram of a thing called a 'brand wheel'. It consisted of various segments that represented different aspects of running a bookshop. Things so painfully obvious that it seemed unnecessary to write them down.There were lots of words like knowledge (not 'learnings', on this occasion), authority, communication, enthusiasm and development. I suppose it was more positive than my approach, which was to simply Not Be Crap.But there was a reductive quality about the brand wheel that smacked of totalitarianism (I'm sure that Stalin would have had one if he'd known about them): this is who we are, this is what we think and this is what we must do.Here are some examples of brand wheels. Let's begin with a simple one:It looks nice doesn't it - I like the colours - and it's reassuringly simple: forming an idea, deciding who it should be aimed at, how to communicate it and how to avoid screwing up. That's the first slide in our Powerpoint presentation.Now I'm going to turn up the wheel to Level 2:That's at least 15 minutes' worth of nonsense, assuming that the speaker limits themselves to around two minutes per segment. At this point in the presentation, I'm usually wondering if I can get away with taking the last Bourbon biscuit without looking desperate.Then things start to get really nasty:At this stage in the presentation, my benign contempt usually turns to rising anger. I feel like Peter Finch in Network. This is the end of civilisation as we know it. Once we talked with passion about justice, equality and fraternity. Now we're discussing the 'purchase experience'.In the post-apocalyptic wasteland of the future, six-fingered historians will hold the charred remains of brand wheels and conclude that we deserved to die.I am now going to turn the Brand Wheel up to 11:By now I feel like Charlton Heston at the end of 'Beneath the Planet of the Apes', grimly pressing the self-destruct button. I expect someone was very proud of themselves when they created this wheel.Would you want to be friends with them?If you work in an environment where people have serious conversations about 'brand positioning', then I recommend that you include the Level 11 Brand Wheel in your next Powerpoint presentation. It will baffle and impress in equal measure.The only downside is that the people you really like will hate you.But it isn't just dull corporations that have brand wheels:It looks like a rather dull daytime television quiz - \"I'll have Cities, Jim\" - where the answer could just as easily be Germany or Belgium. I wonder how much money was spent coming up with this fatuous representation of a complex nation.Local authorities have also joined in:Brand wheels contribute nothing to the good of mankind and they should be treated with the contempt they deserve. But as we enter recession, employees will probably feel less able to speak out against the rising tide of banal, business-speak in the workplace.I only hope that as the recession deepens, paying people to develop brand wheels and hold team building exercises will be increasingly viewed as an unnecessary expense.Rant over."},

{"title": "Charles Dickens", "date": "Tuesday, February 07, 2012", "text": "Given that my nom de blog owes its existence to David Copperfield, it would seem rather ungrateful to ignore the fact that today is Charles Dickens' 200th birthday.Here he is, painted by one of his friends, my wife's great-great-great uncle, William Powell Frith:Everybody loves Dickens. A few of the hardcore fans even read his books, but most people are content to enjoy the lavish BBC adaptations, denuded of any of that nasty, dense prose that makes them take more than a week to read.They don't know what they're missing.I will be paying my own tribute later today, by not throwing any Charles Dickens books into the recycling bin at work.The last Dickens novel I read was Bleak House. I was alone in Chile, staying in a small town at the foot of a volcano. It was winter in England, but the middle of summer there and I spent long afternoons lazing by a deep blue lake. It was an idyllic setting.But I was homesick. I hadn't spoken to anyone for nearly two weeks and was feeling increasingly isolated. Then I started reading Bleak House and found that I was no longer travelling alone. Dickens remained my constant companion for the rest of the journey and I found solace in a lost world of damp, ivy-clad stone, autumnal woodsmoke and long shadows.I have a secret fantasy of being stranded again in another part of the world, with only a Charles Dickens novel for company.But rather than write any more, I will let Mr Dickens have the final word, with a small selection of quotes:The whole difference between construction and  creation is exactly this: that a thing constructed can only be loved  after it is constructed; but a thing created is loved before it exists. The civility which money will purchase, is rarely extended to those who have none.Regrets are the natural property of grey hairs. No one is useless in this world who lightens the burden of it to anyone else. It was one of those March days when the sun shines  hot and the wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter  in the shade. There is nothing better than a friend, unless it is a friend with chocolate.Suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me  to understand what your heart used to be. I have been bent and broken,  but - I hope - into a better shape.No one who can read, ever looks at a book, even unopened on a shelf, like one who cannot."},

{"title": "Private Lives", "date": "Saturday, February 04, 2012", "text": "I have just spent a week working on a farm owned by gypsies, in a remote part of the Weald that seems to have its own subarctic microclimate. On the first day I wore a t-shirt, corduroy shirt, Fair Isle sweater and fleece, thinking that this would be perfectly adequate.It wasn't.By yesterday, I had so many layers of clothing on that I moved like an Apollo astronaut. This made it difficult to sort through the boxes of books that were housed in a barn, but at least my teeth were no longer chattering.Perhaps the most useful things I bought with me were a Russian hat - particularly important if you're thinning on top - and some antibacterial handwash (some of the boxes have rat droppings in them). Next week I'll also have some skiwear, so I should be okay.The other morning I was alone in the barn when a ruddy-faced man appeared at the door and started talking to me about the state of the floor. I politely said that it was nothing to do with me and continued sorting through the books, but he didn't take the hint.After telling me the same thing for the third time, he introduced himself as Bob and I caught a very strong whiff of alcohol. My heart sank. This wasn't going to be easy.For the next hour I tried to get rid of Bob, but the drink had reduced his short-term memory to four seconds and he seemed to be operating on a loop, reintroducing himself to me every few minutes. In the end, I gave up and said I was going home.The next day the owner of the farm came up to me. \"I see you've met Bob then.\" I nodded. He shrugged his shoulders, adding \"Well, he is what he is.\"I liked the owner's philosophical attitude. As far as he was concerned, as long as Bob got the job done, that was all that mattered. It was such a contrast to the modern workplace, where HR departments rigorously do everything they can to observe employment law and equal opportunities legislation, but often end up with an environment that doesn't accommodate people's eccentricities.I think that this is due to a blurring of the line between the public and private parts of our lives.In the 1950s and 60s, my parents worked at the headquarters of the Post Office Savings Bank in Kew. It was a huge building that employed hundreds of civil servants in vast offices, lined with rows of desks.According to my parents, the bank was run in an uncompromisingly strict way. Lateness and absenteeism were not tolerated and people's personal circumstances were regarded as irrelevant. When I was born, at 3.30pm on a cold March afternoon, there was no question of my father being allowed to leave work an hour early, or even make a phone call outside the allocated break times.What a contrast to today's workplace.But there was an upside to this. If your personal life was irrelevant, it also followed that there was no attempt to own your soul. As long as you were punctual, diligent, hard working and honest, your political views and personal opinions were of no interest to an employer. It didn't matter whether you were a team player and believed in 'brand values' or not.As a result, the Savings Bank employed a selection of people that was, in many ways, more 'inclusive' and 'diverse' than many modern workplaces. That's putting it politely. All human life was there, from battle-scarred war veterans to people who would now be diagnosed as autistic. The one thing they all had in common was an aptitude for numbers.My mother said that her colleagues were usually quite circumspect about their personal lives, but when you worked with the same people year after year, little snippets of information gradually built up into a whole picture.My mother knew that Mr Fortescue occasionally had blackouts and thought he was back in the Burmese jungle. She also knew that Mrs Clutterbuck was afraid of being contaminated by germs and that Miss Snellham and Miss Havering had a 'funny friendship' (my mother's expression). But it was no-one's business. Privacy was respected.There was one notable exception - my mother didn't know that Mr Christie in room 17B was a serial killer (a man that my father described as \"a very quiet chap who kept himself to himself\"). That was one example of a private life being a little too private.I wouldn't want to turn the clock back. I'm grateful that there is legislation that protects people from discrimination and recognises that their personal circumstances should be accommodated, wherever possible. I'm glad that Miss Snellham can now expect compassionate leave if Hiss Havering's mother dies.But I do mourn the loss of a private life and a growing culture of conformity that would have branded some my mother's colleagues as unemployable.When the last company I worked for created a human resources department, the new HR manager decided that she needed to foster a 'team' culture. Weekly meetings were set up, with the most excrutiatingly embarrassing team-building activities: \"Okay, today I want you to write what each person's strengths and weaknesses are on a post-it note and stick it up on the wall...\" (apparently I was 'friendly' and 'polite').We were also asked to talk about our personal lives. On the one hand, I was moved to discover that a young man in the warehouse lived in a family of drug addicts and loved his job because he wanted to make something of himself, but I could also see how uncomfortable he felt.I liked the HR manager and respected her motives, but felt terribly exposed by her attempts to make us bond.Do we always need to have a team spirit in the workplace? What does it actually mean? A culture that once valued experience, honesty, diligence, reliability and maturity has been replaced, in some workplaces at least, with one that rewards conformity, youth, extroversion, enthusiasm and energy. We need a balance between the two and a recognition that a bad team player might nevertheless be a valued employee.We've legislated against racial and sexual discrimination. Now it's time to protect those who are shy or just odd. Don't make them go tenpin bowling unless they really want to!We also need to redraw that line between the personal and the private.Perhaps I'm just saying this because I'm now in my 40s, well on the way to becoming an old git. How can I compete with a 22-year-old who is \"hungry for success\" (a friend of mine recently heard a young colleague say this without a hint of irony) and untainted by the experience of working for tossers?Luckily, I'm self-employed, but the tiniest possibility that one day I could find myself in a room full of people again, talking earnestly about 'brand values' (or even worse, a 'brand wheel') still brings me out in a cold sweat."},

I think I need the discpline of a self-imposed timetable, otherwise I'd just lie in bed looking at YouTube clips of chimpanzees playing the bassoon. Perhaps I'd start to smell too.Every weekday, without fail, I'm out of the house by 9.00am and drive to my cowshed, listening to Radio Four podcasts. Yesterday I listened to one about the rise of megacities and how many of us secretly wished that most people would disappear, apart from our friends and loved ones. I concurred.I rarely spend more than five minutes at the farm. The Steerforth Books cowshed is just a bare concrete shell and at this time of year, isn't the most inviting of environments. It is also surprisingly noisy, with a succession of tractors and lorries appearing at regular intervals.I had planned to turn the farm unit into an office with two workstations, shelving for 6,000 books and a packing area. But at the moment, I just grab a few boxes of unsorted stock and take them back to the warmth and comfort of my home, where I can listen to music and make as many cups of tea as I like.The first two hours of the day are spent valuing stock, identifying the small percentage of titles that are worth selling. Sometimes it can be quite soul-destroying to realise that books which seemed to have so much promise are utterly worthless, but at least I get to enjoy covers like this:Shortly before lunchtime I pack the orders and take them to be posted. People often complain about post office staff, but the employees of the Lewes branch deserve a medal for their unceasing courtesy and professionalism, in the face of unremitting tedium. I'm sure their hearts sink when I walk in the door with a bag full of parcels, but they never let on.After lunch I begin logging the valuable books, adding them to the sales inventory. Each title requires a full description of the book's condition, listing every fault. Phrases like 'cocked binding', 'bumped corners' and 'light rubbing' are part of my small lexicion of bibliographical terms. I avoid acronyms or excessive jargon.There is a repetitive, machine-like quality to the work and I know that it drives some people mad, but the reward is the ever changing selection of books, many of which are unintentionally amusing:'Staring at her offensively were several villagers''Where did you get this pass from, Missy?'\"Pull, Jill, pull\" cried Laura, exerting all her strength\"And if anyone asks what we're doing, tell them you dropped half a crown down your dress and I'm helping you find it\"'Sheelagh bore the new girl off in triumph'(clearly unperturbed by the fact that she was an identical clone of 'Sheelagh')\"Gosh, after all that fresh air I can't wait until we get to Radclyffe Hall!\"\"One of these is a genuine Louis Vuitton, the other's from Primark. Can you tell them apart?\"Obviously I made some of these up (and refrained from publishing the ruder ones), but the original captions often contain unintended double entendres and there's something poignant about their innocence. Today, the small white object in the policeman's hand would be a sachet of cocaine or a cloned credit card.Finally, a superb dustjacket for a novel by a writer who was, to George Orwell's dismay, one of the most popular authors of her day:"},
{"title": "Love in a Cold Climate", "date": "Wednesday, January 18, 2012", "text": "Only three months ago, I was reading about the gulags in 'Life and Fate', thinking how awful it would be to do hard labour in sub-zero temperatures. Now, by some cruel twist of fate, I'm doing exactly that. If Solzhenitsyn was still alive, I'd feel that I could look him in the eye.Admitedly I'm not a political prisoner, there are no armed guards waiting to shoot me if I try to leave and I'm not mining uranium with my bare hands, so the analogy doesn't quite hold up. But it has been very cold.However, it will have all been worthwhile if I can find some decent books. For the time being, here are some indecent ones that I found today:\"Underneath their uniforms, they were simply girls - warm, soft, yielding creatures who lived fast and loved too recklessly...\"From the 'Five Miles High' club to the '500 Miles High' version:\"She's young, she's lovely - she's an astronaut! And she's been assigned a dangerous mission: to discover the whereabouts of four missing male astronauts who had preceded her to the moon.\"If this was the 1970s, I could make a link using the words 'moon' and 'heavenly bodies':\"Laura was the kind of woman that every man wanted to undress - but she never gave them the chance - she did it herself!\"This nonsense all stopped in the early 80s. Was it just AIDS that made promiscuity less appealing or were there other factors too, like the demise of modernism, the growing realisation that sexual liberation had been rather one-sided and the increasing demand for equal opportunities? Also, what part did technology play - first the video recorder, then the internet - in putting an end to 'sauce' and 'titilation'?Oddly enough, I don't find the images themselves that dated. Look at the video of Pixie Lott's 'What Do You Take Me For?' and it's as if the 1980s never happened. What really dates these books are the hilarious blurbs, with their \"warm, soft, yielding creatures...\"It all seems a world away from this:"},

{"title": "Austerity and Atonement", "date": "Thursday, January 12, 2012", "text": "Several people have kindly emailed me recently, asking how they can find  Steerforth Books. The answer is, I'm afraid,with great difficulty. At  the moment I operate almost by stealth, selling books in the dark  corners of the internet, like a 1940s black marketeer (but all above  board, I hasten to add).As for the actual home of Steerforth Books, it's a small dot in the middle of this photograph:I'm tempted to do a sort of 'spot-the-ball'  competition, but I'm not quite sure where I am. Wherever it is, it's  too far from my house, but at least the journey takes me through some  beautiful countryside.Yesterday, on the way home, I turned off down a small lane and ended up here:The  atmospheric mist is actually a bonfire - just out of the picture a man,  who looked as if he'd escaped from the 14th century, was burning  leaves. I smiled at him. He snarled back.Driving  through Sussex, you can travel through time as well as space. The main  roads inhabit a world of wi-fi, retail parks and smoothies, but take a B  road and you suddenly find yourself among the ghosts of other Englands:  medieval, Georgian, Victorian and early 20th century, where woodsmoke  rises from the chimneys of solitary cottages and death watch beetles  rattle in ancient beams (I originally wrote 'death watch beatles', which  would be a good name for a geriatric tribute act).Sometimes I  dream of being in one of those lonely buildings, with a fruit and  vegetable garden, some chickens and a shed for my books. However, I  would miss being in a town, particularly Lewes. I love the feeling of  being connected, looking out at the roofs of my neighbours' houses at  twilight and listening to the footsteps of people coming home from work.But  to return to Steerforth Books, I feel quietly optimistic about the  business. The sales are growing steadily every week and, by Easter, I  think I'll have reached a level where the profits provide a reasonable  income.In the meantime, Mrs Steerforth and I have adopted austerity measures. Trips to Waitrose are out  and I have made a solemn promise not to do any internet shopping under  the influence of alcohol (although I don't regret buying the meteorite).On  the subject of alcohol, we have both decided to cut out drinking during  the week. Sharing a bottle of wine in the evening had become a habit.  It felt like a reward for the challenges we had faced during the day.  But, aside from the health risks, when I worked out how much we were  spending I realised that it would pay for a holiday.Mrs  Steerforth was particularly keen to cut down on wine after disgracing  herself at a party on New Year's Eve, when she became more drunk than I  have ever seen her.Ironically, only hours earlier, she had published an article about the secrets of avoiding a hangover on New Year's Day.Quite  how Mrs Steerforth failed to follow her own advice is a mystery, but  she was one of many people who have fallen victim to our neighbours'  generosity with alcohol. She has no memory of jumping up and down to  'Born Slippy' or trying to read a bedtime story to our sons at 12.30am before sliding down the stairs.But  the true moment of horror came the following morning, when my wife  couldn't find the underwear she'd been wearing the night before. The  expression on her face when I suggested it might be next door was  priceless (as was the look of relief when I later told her that it was  actually in our bathroom).Since then, Mrs Steerforth has been drinking elderflower juice by the gallon, determined to atone for her transgression.2012  is going to be a year of sobriety and hard work. The next few months  are going to be particularly exhausting for me, but it will hopefully  all be worthwhile in the end. On the plus side, I should soon have a new  range of book covers and ephemera to share - this blog hasn't been the  same without them."},

{"title": "Last Year in the Book Trade", "date": "Monday, January 02, 2012", "text": "As far as the book trade is concerned, I think most people would agree that it was the year of the Kindle, with over a million sold per week in December. HarperCollins alone sold 100,000 ebooks on Christmas Day.This time last year I was firmly in the anti-Kindle camp and wrote several posts extolling the virtues of the printed page over the soulless, grey world of ebooks. But I protested too much and one blogger very astutely commented that I was actually \"on the verge of Kindledom\".I finally gave in during March, swayed by the comments made by fellow bloggers and I have to say, I love my Kindle. It's convenient (my nearest proper bookshop is eight miles away), doesn't clutter up my shelves with books I'll never read again and gives me the chance the try sample chapters before I commit to buying the books.But there's a dark side to all of this. The Kindle also threatens many booksellers with extinction and could make it harder for authors to earn a living wage from their writing, so I'm in the process of rethinking how I buy books. Particularly after this Facebook discussion that took place a couple of days ago (I won't name the author, as she hasn't given me permission to quote):Reader 1 -Also love my Kindle and am a  sucker for an amazon bargain (sorry). Can't beat the personal service of  the 7s bookshop though... Is the publishing world doing anything to  support authors? Surely no incentive to write (and I'm aware noone is in  it for the money) means no wares to sell?Author - @Reader 1 - 'Is the publishing world  doing anything to support authors?'  There is a short answer to this.  No.  Having been an author for ten years and knowing that my books have  been appreciated by thousands I am now forced to consider writing a  hobby as I could earn more working on a supermarket check out or  sweeping the streets. x Reader 2 - I'm buying ebooks for an average of £5 each. How much of this is going to the author?Author - @Reader 2 - this is a good question.  For  the two of my books that have earned out the advance - if you buy it  for £5 I believe I may get as much as about 0.20p  (but I have to check  this) For the two that have not earned out the advance I get nothing.   For  the 0.99p purchace of Steve's above the author may - if they are  lucky and have earned out - get about 0.5p.  But I may be exaggerating  the payment to the author wildly here.    I always encourage my readers  to buy their books from bookshops to keep the bookshops open.Reader 2 - I'm really shocked. I was  always under the impression that authors received 10% of the rrp, with  the burden of any discounts shouldered by the publisher and retailer.  What's the best thing we can do to support writers?Author - @Reader 2 - no the author gets 10% of  whatever the book is sold at... after (and if) the advance is earned out  (and it's only earned out by a payment at 10 % of whatever the book is  sold at) and then after that the agent takes 15% so if people like Steve  buy books at 0.99p ... The best thing you can do to support an author  is to buy the book from a bookshop at the price that is on the cover.   Likewise on Kindle if you pay full price for the download then the  author may eventually get a small payment.The controversy over the 'agency model' (and you can read a full explanation here if you're interested) will continue to rage in 2012. Like a lot of readers, I like cheap books, but not at the authors' expense.The other big event of 2011 was the rescue of Waterstone's from the edge of oblivion. For people outside the UK, I should explain that it's Britain's largest specialist chain bookseller and for ten years, was run by a succession of 'retailers' (i.e. people who thought that selling books was no different from selling shoes or CDs) who almost destroyed the business. Waterstone's is now in private ownership, freed from the tyranny of short-termism, with a real bookseller at the helm for the first time in years.However, although things are now looking more positive, I can't help feeling that it's still too late for Waterstone's and that MD James Daunt is merely a Alexander Kerensky/Shapour Bakhtiar figure, unable to stop the tide of history. I may be wrong. Perhaps James Daunt can cure Waterstone's, but I suspect that palliative care is the most he can provide.As for the literary highlights of 2011, I'll leave that to the many other bloggers - John Self, Gaskella and company - who are highly accomplished book reviewers. However, I will mention one first novel which, I felt, didn't receive the press attention it deserved - 'Wall of Days' by Alastair Bruce -in spite of being picked by Amazon in its 'Rising Stars' promotion.If I try to explain the plot I might put you off, so it's probably better to simply include this link to the first few pages. If you like bald, understated prose, like Cormac McCarthy or M. J. Hyland, where devastating truths are hidden beneath mundane recollections, then I can highly recommend this magical novel.Another reason why Wall of Days struck a chord is that for several years, I'd had a novel brewing in my head that had a very similar beginning. As soon as I began reading the first page, I felt a huge sense of relief that someone had written the novel for me and done a much better job of it. I can now hit the pillow without any more recurring images of grey skies and tussock grass.Finally, I must mention one other book: Vasily Grossman's 'Life and Fate', which is belatedly being acknowledged as one of the great novels of the 20th century, comparable to War and Peace in its scope and ambition. Although the English translation appeared a few years ago, it wasn't until 2011 that Grossman's epic began to receive the recognition it deserved.It took me over a month to read Life and Fate, but I would happily read it all over again tomorrow.Finally, I'd like to wish anyone who reads 'the Age of Uncertainty' a Happy New Year. After a number of challenges and upheavals last year, the blog began to  run out of steam towards the end of the year, as I was exhausted by family difficulties and preoccupied with setting up my own bookselling business.Perhaps, after five years, this blog has reached a natural end. But it's possible that once I have new sources of stock, there will be other stories to tell. I really enjoy sharing the strange fragments of lost lives that seem to come my way and hope that there will be more to come.We shall see."},
{"title": "A Different Tune", "date": "Friday, December 30, 2011", "text": "I've just returned from Rye, where I met an old friend for a drink.Twelve  years ago he was living around the corner from my flat in Twickenham,  earning a fortune in business publishing, but hating every minute of his  working day. Then one day he decided he'd had enough, sold his flat for  £120,000 and bought another on the Kent coast for £60,000, using the  balance to pay off his mortgage.He's never had a 'proper' job since,  and seems much happier for it.Last year he was invited to  audition for a French punk-folk band (he is a violinist) and phoned to  book a seat as a foot passenger on a cross-channel ferry. \"I'm sorry,\"  he was told, \"but we don't accept foot passengers any more, only people  with vehicles. You'll have to pay the car rate, which is £60\".My friend slammed the phone down in disgust, lit a cigarette and fumed. Then he had an idea and redialled the number:\"You said I had to pay for a vehicle. If I came by bicycle, how much would that cost?\"\"£10\".Two  weeks later, my friend was the sole cyclist in a slowly moving queue of  cars and lorries at Dover's docks, congratulating himself for his moral  victory over mindless bureaucracy. The band were apparently waiting for  him in Calais, so he decided to spend the hour-long crossing relaxing  in the bar.With five minutes left until the ferry docked, my  friend made his way down to the vehicle hold and unchained his bicycle.  Soon, he could hear the sound of chains moving and ramps descending,  followed by the hissing of hydraulic brakes as the lorries began to  edge forward. He quickly phoned one of the band members to find out  where he needed to go.\"'Allo Graham. You muss follow le traffique and take ze second exit on the left. Yes? We are 500 metres away\".Graham  followed their directions faithfully, making sure that he took the  correct exit and found himself cycling up a rather steep ramp, which  left him feeling a little breathless. To his relief, the ramp became  flatter and seemed to be joining a proper road, then suddenly:  WOOSSSHHHHH!A powerful gust of wind almost knocked him off his  bike and to Graham's horror, he found himself on a motorway being  buffeted by a succession of fast-moving lorries. There didn't seem any  way to get off the motorway. Terrified, he stood on the edge of the slow  lane, wondering what to do next.Suddenly, Graham's phone rang:  \"'Allo Graham. Eet is me again. Do NOT take ze second exit!  Comprenez-vous? It is the WRONG exit!\"After a farcical (and very  dangerous) half hour spent trying to leave the motorway, Graham  eventually found the band and began what turned out to be a very  alcoholic weekend. He now plays gigs with them on both sides of the  channel.It's strange how people's lives can change so much, in ways that we could never predict.In  the late 1990s, Graham seemed to have it all. He was earning at least  four times as much as me and always seemed to be getting promoted.  Evenings were often spent in smart restaurants, dining with the leading  lights of international banking, or at the Strangers' Bar at the House of  Commons, getting gossip from drunken MPs.Occasionally Graham  would say how depressed he was by the ease of his ascent. He'd never  been particularly interested in business publishing and couldn't  understand why people at the highest levels accepted him as one of their  own. Success bought financial rewards and status, but also increasing  levels of stress, boredom and frustration.I don't know what finally pushed Graham to suddenly hand his notice in  and he'd never expressed any interest in visiting Kent, let alone living  there, but within the space of a few months he completely transformed  his life.Today, Graham plays the fiddle at folk festivals and private functions,  earning just enough to pay the bills and enjoy the occasional trip to  India. He lives quite frugally but is completely debt-free and doesn't  miss his old life at all.I'm sure that Graham's example partly gave me the courage and  inspiration to change my life. Unlike Graham, I've never had to face the  same temptations (although I was made a very attractive offer earlier  this year), but it was still hard to take a leap into the unknown.After saying goodbye to Graham, I sat on the train and looked at BBC  News. In a piece about people who died in 2011, I saw these particularly  apposite quotes by Steve Jobs:\"Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever    encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost    everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment    or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only    what is truly important. Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.    Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other    people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your    own inner voice.\"I know it's easy to make statements like that when you're the billionaire CEO of a corporation (I'm not sure what the Chinese sweatshop workers who make many of Apple's products would say), but I agree with the sentiments.I think that next year will be all about putting these ideas into practice."},
{"title": "The Age of Uncertainty", "date": "Wednesday, December 21, 2011", "text": "This  evening, as we were driving home in the dark after returning a van to a  slightly menacing industrial estate, my wife turned to me and said, 'You  haven't done your blog for ages.'This came as a shock.  Obviously I knew that I hadn't written any posts for over a month - the  longest gap in five years of blogging - but I had no idea that my wife  was aware of this. She used to claim that she never read my blog, as she  was far too busy being an übermother to fritter her time away on such  trifles.I hadn't intended to stop blogging, but it seemed a  rather self-indulgent thing to do while I was trying to establish an  internet business. Also, I couldn't think of anything to say. However,  after receiving several kind emails from people who have wondered if  things are okay, I thought I'd write this brief post.I've now  been self-employed for 11 weeks and, although it hasn't been a  particularly easy time, I feel liberated in so many ways. Steerforth  Books didn't get off to a rip-roaring start, but thanks to the kindness  and generosity of a fellow blogger (I won't embarrass them here, but I  am eternally grateful), it received a huge boost and the business no  longer feels like a pipe dream.I've no idea what the future  holds. I've swapped the dependable, but soul-destroying, certainty of my  last job for something that makes emotional sense, but may lead to  financial ruin. Have I made a terrible mistake?All I know is  that the worst decisions I've ever made have all been rational ones that  appeared to make perfect sense, whilst the best ones have been inspired  by childhood fantasies, daydreaming, gut instincts and my adolescent  sense of right and wrong. In the last two months, I feel that I have  become me again, after years in exile.Perhaps this is my  mid-life crisis. All of the elements are there: an aging parent, a child  entering adolescence and the sense of having possibly passed the  halfway point. Some men respond by dying their hair that weird, chestnut  colour and sleeping with someone in their 20s. My ambitions are  hopefully less ridiculous.I apologise for the solemn nature of  this post. I have just been to Sainsbury's in Newhaven and it always has  that effect on me. I've no idea why."},
{"title": "Travels With My Aunt", "date": "Friday, November 18, 2011", "text": "Last week, during a particularly depressing, overcast, autumnal day, I decided to clear out the loft. I say loft, but after converting most of it into a third bedroom, all we have left are some hidden eaves which look like the sorts of places where people used to hide from the Gestapo.      Getting into the eaves requires a Houdini-like dexterity, as the space is so narrow. Getting out is even harder, reminding me of the claustrophobic tunnel scenes in The Great Escape. On several occasions, when my wife has failed to hear my hysterical shouting, I've had to phone her and ask to be rescued.     Fortunately, this time I seemed to be more pliable (perhaps six weeks away from the 9 to 5 routine has relaxed my tensed muscles?) and managed to move around easily, unpacking boxes that had remained unopened since we moved here ten years ago.      Almost everything I found was of no use or value to anyone, but there was one exception: a small square box with a Super 8 cine film inside.      This is what it contained:        The woman pushing twigs into the kettle was my mother's sister, Patricia Eunice Dorothy Prior, who worked as a midwife in a small town at the foot of the Atlas Mountains, in Morocco. Officially she was a missionary, sponsored by a number of churches in Britain, but as it was against the law to promote any religion other than Islam, my aunt had to limit her activities to good works.      Pat grew up in a family of six who lived in the upstairs half of a small, terraced house. She shared a bed with her two sisters and at night she would lie awake listening to the sound of mice scuttling across the floor.My aunt, on the left   Her parents' ambitions for her were typical for their background: at 14 she could either go into service or get a job in a shop. But Pat was bright. She passed her 11 Plus and got into Richmond Grammar School, where she sat her final exams during an air raid.      If Pat had come from another background she might have gone to university, but higher education was never an option. Fortunately, her parents didn’t object when Pat announced that she wished to train as a nurse.My aunt during her training, on the left (above) and second row, third from left (below)By all accounts Pat was an exceptional student and the skills she learned at West Middlesex Hospital would prove invaluable a few years later, when she decided to train to become a missionary. In Pat’s words, she had a ‘calling’ and felt compelled to pursue it. A gruelling training at Bible College followed, during which Pat had to learn to become fluent at reading and writing Arabic.     I can’t begin to imagine what it must have been like for Pat when she first arrived in Morocco, where a young, single woman was a second-class citizen. However, during the next 25 years, my aunt carved out a successful life for herself, respected by everyone in the community.      It helped that almost every person under the age of 20 had been delivered by my aunt, sometimes under difficult conditions. Many local families felt that they owed Pat a debt.      When I was 16, Pat invited me to stay with her. We couldn’t afford to travel as a family, so I flew alone to Casablanca and met my aunt at the airport. It was a 300km journey to her home and, as we drove south, my preconceived notions of an arid, desert-like country were replaced by vivid memories of lush pine forests, snow-capped mountains and orange-blossom scented air.     It was a culture shock. I had grown up in a dull London suburb, where evening meals alternated between fish fingers and beef burgers. Suddenly, I was plunged into an alien world of strange food, exotic landscapes and opulent souks.     I had been terrified of eating the local food (particularly when I learned that I would have to eat everything that was put in front of me), but I needn’t have worried. After two weeks of dates, artichokes, couscous, mint tea and carrot and orange salad, I learned that eating could be a pleasure as well as a necessity.     Morocco changed my life. It awakened me to a new, sensual world of smell, taste and colour. But, more importantly, for the first time in my life I learned to see my own society more objectively, realising that happiness was not related to GDP.     I was in a privileged position in many ways. As my aunt enjoyed some prestige in the local area, we were invited into several homes and I was struck by the contrast between the public and private worlds of the local people. Outside, I only saw impoverished-looking mud-brick walls and austere, veiled women. Inside, the veils came down and I found myself in colourful, comfortable rooms, full of laughter and conversation.     Using my aunt as an interpreter, I was able to have conversations with people and, perhaps because of my age, I could get away with asking direct questions.      I had arrived at the right time too. Television aerials were starting to appear on buildings, but the town was still largely cut off from the outside world. As a European, I could have encountered some hostility, but the days of French colonialism belonged to a past generation and religious enmities belonged to a future one. I was treated as an honoured guest.     When I returned home, I felt very depressed for a while. I looked out of my bedroom window at the different shades of grey, from the slate roofs of houses to the low-lying clouds, and yearned for blue skies, prickly pears and orange blossom. I could see why my aunt didn’t want to come home.     Nine years later, my aunt was reluctantly contemplating retirement in Britain. She would have to swap social status and a large house for the genteel poverty of a state pension and a pokey flat. I think she dreaded it.     Pat came home for a short visit to sort out her affairs and work out where she was going to live. On the last day, I said goodbye to my aunt and wanted to hug her, but Pat wasn’t a physically demonstrative person and I was afraid that I might unnerve her, as if we were saying goodbye for the last time.      The next day Pat arrived at Tangiers Airport and was planning to get a lift home from a friend, but a Moroccan lawyer was waiting for her and insisted that she travelled with him instead. He was interested in buying her house and wanted to get her signature on some of the legal documents. They argued for a few minutes until Pat finally agreed.      During the journey from the airport, a lorry crashed into the side of the lawyer’s car. My aunt died a few hours later. The lawyer escaped with a few scratches.     Most of my aunt’s friends were Christians and their attempts to find some meaning in her death only increased my sense of the utter futility of it. I couldn’t accept the argument that some crude form of divine intervention had spared my aunt the horrors of retired life in England. I know that she would have made a successful new life for herself and been a doting great-aunt to my sons.     My aunt’s death was tragic and pointless, however her life certainly wasn’t, because I know that in a small town 2000 miles away, there are dozens, perhaps hundreds of lives that wouldn’t have been lived without her."},
{"title": "Chair Way To Devon", "date": "Sunday, November 13, 2011", "text": "According to my wife I am impulsive, frequently making rash, reckless decisions that I later regret. I'm not sure how true this is. My most impulsive act - spontaneously booking a flight to Chile because the weather in February was depressing me - made perfect sense.I would also argue that it was due to my impulsiveness that we got on the property ladder, during a brief lull in the housing market.However, the case for the prosecution has become much stronger recently, thanks to a moment of madness on eBay a couple of weeks ago, when I made a winning bid (in fact the only bid) for four Edwardian chairs.It seemed too good to be true: £40 for the lot. Surely I could sell them for at least £200?It was only after I'd congratulated myself for winning the chairs that I realised that collecting them would involve a 350-mile round trip to Devon.I don't mind driving long distances in the Nevada desert, but in Britain it's an endurance course of roundabouts, roadworks, caravans and geriatric drivers. I was very tempted to pull out and tell the seller that they could keep the money.However, this morning I began the long drive along the coast of southern England. To make the journey bearable, I had several CDs of Radio Four podcasts: a recent Start the Week, from Sydney, with Thomas Keneally, Kate Grenville and Deborah Cheetham; the first episode of a dramatisation of 'Life and Fate'; a documentary about Elgar during the First World War and two episodes of 'Desert Island Discs', with Diana Athill and Ann Leslie.When 'Life and Fate' was first broadcast as a BBC radio drama, two months ago, I considered listening to it as an alternative to tackling the dauntingly thick book. But in another edition of Start the Week, Linda Grant was so persuasive about Life and Fate's status as one of the great 20th century novels, I felt I had to read the book.I'm really glad I did.The  radio adaptation is perfectly fine, but it's very different from the book and barely scratches the surface of Grossman's complex, profound masterpiece.Sadly, just as the episode really started to take off, I hit a succession of roundabouts and every other minute the Satnav lady bellowed instructions at me, which was rather distracting:\"Ludymila, we are returning to Moscow! We must TAKE THE SECOND EXIT AT THE NEXT ROUNDABOUT.\"I arrived at the house just before 11.00. Luckily, I remembered the Remembrance Sunday two minutes' silence in time to avoid any faux pas.In the window of the front door, there was a slightly intimidating notice warning that the owners possessed a ferocious, possibly illegal dog. I wondered what I was letting myself in for. Fortunately, the seller was a really nice man who seemed genuinely concerned that I had made such a ridiculously long journey (I'm not sure if it was my physical or mental health that he was worried about).On the way back I decided to make a detour to one of my favourite places - Lyme Regis:The Cobb hasn't changed very much since Jane Austen described it in 'Persuasion'. Today it wasn't quite as dramatic as the opening scene in 'The French Lieutenant's Woman' (when Meryl Streep's stunt double was nearly washed into the sea) and people confidently ambled along the occasionally treacherous stones:I've lost count of how many times I've been to Lyme. I used to dream of running the bookshop there and imagined walking along the seafront during winter storms, searching for fossils that had been loosened from the crumbling, slate cliffs.During the journey home, I discovered that 300,000 Londoners used the Underground to shelter from air raids in the First World War, compared to 150,000 during the Blitz. I also learned about the enforced separation of Australian Aboriginal babies from their mothers, Diana Athill's first kiss and Ann Leslie's bizarre meeting with Indira Gandhi.It might have been a long drive, but there are worse ways of spending a day than driving through pleasant countryside, listening to intelligent conversation.I now have four chairs to sell (which I may end up keeping) and I'm relieved to say that my rather pathetic inventory of 42 books has now increased to 437. Only 7563 books to go.One other piece of good news: I now also have a 'Steerforth Books' header, which has subtle echoes of the Downs and 1940s book jackets. I shall be using this on my website when it's launched next year:I can't wait to get started."},
{"title": "Arcane Fire", "date": "Sunday, November 06, 2011", "text": "I'm feeling a little fragile today, as I celebrated November 5th at my next door neighbours' house and whenever I go there, things always get out of hand. I don't know how much I had to drink, but at some point in the evening I became an expert on subjects as diverse as French history and Arcade Fire.Luckily I think I got away with it.Our party included a French woman and a Canadian girl who had never seen the famous Lewes bonfire procession before, so we tried to prepare them for some of the more bizarre aspects of the evening.Last year my neighbour forgot to warn a visitor - a black South African - that the parade included some local people 'blacked-up' and dressed as Zulus. She said that it was a slightly uncomfortable moment, but luckily he was more bemused than horrified.It's estimated that every November 5th, the town's population swells from 16,000 to 60,000, much to the annoyance of many locals. However, there is a quieter part of Lewes where the crowds are bearable.Here's a short video that I took last night:The next video, which I didn't take, gives a much better idea of the scale of the crowds and the wonderful sense of anarchy that pervades the town:I think there was an attempt, a few years ago, to address the obvious health and safety issues, but officials gave up in despair. However, beyond the facade of chaos and pyromania, there are plenty of people on hand - from St John's Ambulance volunteers to plain-clothes police officers - to ensure that the public are safe.According to the BBC, last night there were 15 arrests and 170 injuries, only two of which were serious (and not caused by fireworks).Apparently it used to be a lot worse before the 1850s. I wonder why things changed?"},
{"title": "Lovejoy", "date": "Friday, November 04, 2011", "text": "I am now selling antiques.I'm not quite sure how this happened, but an earlier joke about becoming the Lovejoy of bookselling has turned out to be remarkably prescient.(I read somewhere that Lovejoy has been shown in 127 countries, however if you are from Iran and haven't seen the pirated Farsi-dubbed DVDs, I should explain that he is a fashion icon and widely-respected specialist in antiquties, whose chaste courtship with a woman called Lady Jane would surely appeal to even the most conservative clerics.)I fully intended to stick to books - that's what I know about - but when I saw a set of Edwardian chairs on sale for £40 on eBay, I couldn't resist and made a winning bid, with only seconds to go.I wish the chairs weren't in Devon - 320 miles seems a long way to travel in one day, but I'm convinced that I can make a decent mark-up if I ensure that the chairs are well-photographed and the auction ends on a weekend evening (when many potential buyers will have had a few drinks).Even if I don't make any money, the chairs will have served their purpose by making me realise that there's no earthly reason why I have to stick to books. I can sell anything I like, as long as I make a profit.Indeed, earlier in the week, I contemplated emailing the person who's designing my logo and getting them to scrap the word 'books'.But just as I was losing any faith in getting some stock, the phone rang. It was a man who'd just seen an advert I'd placed in a local paper: would I be interested in buying some military history books?I scribbled down the address and agreed to drive over the following morning.The next day, as I rang the bell of a stranger's house in a town I'd never been to before, I wondered what to expect. An older man opened the door and asked me to remove my shoes and go upstairs. I quickly checked the number to make sure that I had the right house (after an embarrassing incident where I unwittingly turned up to someone else's massage appointment).It was the right place.I was led into a bedroom which, to my relief, had several boxes of books. My heart sank when I saw a pile of short story anthologies (they're impossible to sell), but some of the other titles were more promising.I'd been worrying about how to agree on a price - I hate haggling - and made what I thought was a fair offer. He accepted it immediately, which made me wonder if I could have got away with less. But although I need to make a living, I don't want to rip people off. There has to be an honourable compromise.I now have 38 books, plus a kind donation from the Poet Laura-eate, bringing the total inventory to 42 titles. That's about 0.5% of the total I need to achieve what my old boss James Heneage always used to refer to as 'critical mass'.It's going to be a long, hard slog."},
{"title": "Deep End", "date": "Tuesday, November 01, 2011", "text": "I've just watched an extraordinary 1970 British film called 'Deep End'. It received widespread critical acclaim when it was released and  was a huge success at the Venice Film Festival. But in spite of this, it became almost completely forgotten in the years that followed and until recently, nobody was sure if any prints had survived.Fortunately, a copy was found recently and the BFI have just released a cleaned-up version on Blu-ray and DVD.Here's a trailer:I say 'British' film, but in fact it was financed by the USA and West Germany, written and directed by a Pole - Jerzy Skolimowski - and mostly shot in Munich, with a superb soundtrack by the 'Krautrock' band Can. However, it feels authentically home grown, capturing the depressed, 'morning after' feel of the early 70s perfectly.The film stars Jane Asher and the 16-year-old John Moulder-Brown. I'd never heard of Moulder-Brown and for people of my age, Jane Asher was that nice middle-aged lady who made cakes and used to go out with Paul McCartney. I had no idea what a fantastic actress she was, or how devastatingly sexy she could be.Indeed, the whole film is one of the sexiest things I've ever seen on screen, as Jane Asher's Susan teases and plays with the pubescent passions of 15-year-old Mike. If I'd met Susan when I was 15, I wouldn't have stood a chance.Here is the opening scene. As you'll see, there's some dodgy lip-synch going on with the baths' manager. That's because many of the actors were Germans, who must have been dubbed later:'Deep End' also contains an extraordinary cameo from 1950s screen goddess, Diana Dors, who manages to create a wonderfully grotesque scene that is both comic and deeply unsettling, with an unusual reversal of gender roles.Dors appears here at the beginning and end of this clip, but if you don't want to see all six minutes, skip to 4:04:Finally, before I end up posting the whole film, I particularly liked this scene. The interplay between Jane Asher's Susan and Erica Beer's cashier works very well, but the red paint almost steals the show:I was planning to write a long post about 'Deep End'. However, I found this excellent Guardian article by Ryan Gilbey which says what I was going to say, but far more eloquently. This review by Christopher Weedman is also worth reading.It's strange how British this film feels, given that it was conceived and filmed by a Polish director who had never filmed in Britain before. Like Emeric Pressburger before him, Jerzy Skolimowski managed to take a universal theme and make it seem both quintessentially British and utterly alien at the same time.The result is a triumph."},
{"title": "October is the Cruelest Month", "date": "Saturday, October 29, 2011", "text": "It's  ironic that now I have all the time in the world to write, my blogging  has almost ground to a halt. This wasn't supposed to happen. I'd  imagined writing posts about the progress of 'Steerforth Books' and my  first steps in the precarious world of self-employment.Sadly,  the last four weeks have been a bit of a disaster. Within 24 hours of  leaving my job, everyone in the Steerforth household succumbed to the  horrible Norovirus, which had the one redeeming feature of rapid weight loss.At  times I felt as if I'd made a terrible mistake. Lying in bed,  surrounded by people making zombie-like groaning noises, I couldn't help  looking back fondly to the ordered world of my last job. Perhaps I had just made one of the most stupid decisions of my  life.In the end I wrote a list of the positives and negatives of  my last job. There were two positives: the books and some of the  people. The negatives were everything else. Suddenly everything seemed  much clearer.It's just as well that I felt reasonably sure about  my move, as the month didn't get any better. Bits of the house  collapsed, someone died and both of my sons succumbed to further  illnesses.As for Steerforth Books, it was just a name. I had no  stock to sell, thanks to my former managing director's last minute  intervention.It would be easy to become despondent, but I'm  fairly sanguine. There are times when it pays to be a pessimist and  before I handed my notice in, I made sure that my business plan could  survive a number of setbacks (including a mean-spirited former employer). I knew that it could take months to get  Steerforth Books off the ground and planned accordingly, so it's not  over yet.I will be glad to see the back of October, but it  hasn't been completely dreadful. I've been enjoying Vasily Grossman's  epic masterpiece 'Life and Fate',  watching some long-forgotten British films of the 1960s and trying to  become a domestic god, with mixed results. I also had a very pleasant  evening out at the Lewes Arms with two fellow bloggers.In some  ways it's not a bad life, but even if I could afford to never work  again, I don't think I'd change my plans. I really miss working with  books.I particularly love being surrounded by old books and sometimes feel as  if I am in the literary equivalent of a telephone exchange, connected by  invisible skeins to the lives of strangers. However great or absurd the  titles are, they have furnished both rooms and minds. My passion, I  suppose, is to try and find them new owners.So the plan for the rest of the year is simple: fix the ceiling and get  some books. Now that I've come clean about my lack of progress, perhaps  I'll also write some more blog posts - there are recent discoveries that  I want to share."},
{"title": "Early This Morning", "date": "Sunday, October 16, 2011", "text": "I've always been very dismissive of camera phones and could never understand why they became so popular. The picture quality was consistently awful and transfering the images to a computer was tedious, but in spite of this many people still chose to record some of the most important moments of their life with photos that made the Kodak Instamatic look like the Hubble Telescope. Why?However, I have now discovered a phone that has a half-decent camera:This morning I was driving back from a particularly awful car boot sale that would have made a street market in Burkina Faso look luxuriantly decadent. I don't what I hated most: the piles of used shoes that looked like something out of 'Schindler's List', or the dew-soaked DVDs of low budget horror films like 'Satan's Little Helper'.After such a depressing experience, I decided to lift the spirits with a visit to the Long Man of Wilmington. It was a beautiful morning and as I got out of the car, I regreted not bring a camera with me.Then I remembered my new phone:It's not a great photo. The saturation's not right and the zoom has affected the sharpness, but compared to the old VGA images that I was used to, this was a revelation. It's almost good.This image was taken without the zoom function:Not great, but not bad either.This lacks sharpness, but the colours are far richer than the washed-out, grainy sub-CCTV images on my old phone.A decent camera would have been able to cope more effectively with the contrasts of light and dark, but it's still perfectly acceptable.As I fiddled with the phone's touch screen, The Long Man looked on impassively. He'd seen it all: Roman centurions, Saxon thanes, medieval pilgrims, Victorian farmers and, today, people in garish fleeces walking their oversexed dogs along public footpaths.I shall be seeing a lot more of the Long Man in the future. I think we're going to get along very well."},
{"title": "Vita Nimis Brevis", "date": "Sunday, October 02, 2011", "text": "I left my job on Friday. I had been dreading my last day there for a number of reasons and it proved to be a far more emotional experience than I had anticipated, thanks to some very strange behaviour on the part of my managing director, who overruled his colleagues’ earlier offer to sell me some stock.When asked why, he explained that I was now a competitor. I suppose I should be flattered, but it seemed unnecessarily petty and mean-spirited.For a few minutes I felt like walking out. It would have been so easy to get in the car and drive away, but I decided to hang around just in case there was a surprise presentation with a succession of heartfelt eulogies. It’s just as well, as there was.Also, I would have missed this:  It's a cake with my face on it (printed with edible ink). I was really touched that someone had gone to such lengths, but slightly disappointed to see that nobody wanted my tongue in their mouth. Nothing changes. In the end, I had to eat my own mouth.By the end of the day my mood had lifted. Several directors thanked me for everything I'd done for the business and, for the first time in my working life, I really felt as if I had accomplished something. Managing a bookshop was always a work in progress, unresolved and incomplete, in which leaving felt more like absconding. Here, I could go with my head held high. Sort of.My official reason for resigning was the errant politician's favourite: to spend more time with my family. But, of course, that was only half of the story.The simple fact is that I'd had enough of it all: commuting, working nine to five, managing people, going to meetings, filling in spreadsheets, worrying about sales targets and having to pretend to be a certain type of person. I think that the recent stresses of family life had simply reduced my ability to tolerate the intolerable. As much I liked some of the people I worked with (and for), I felt like a round peg in a square hole.I value time more than money. I also value intellectual curiosity, a sense of the absurd, integrity and kindness. These enduring values are far more important than the ephemeral trappings of worldly success (not that I had many ephemeral trappings to worry about).Several years ago, when I was unemployed for a while, I read Tom Hodgkinson's exhilarating manifesto 'How To Be Free' and recognised a kindred spirit. It strengthened my resolve to avoid being a wage slave, so it was apposite that in today's Independent, he wrote this:'Can you do something you enjoy    and make money doing it? Can you do it without exploiting people and    draining resources? Can you do it with your friends? This was the punk    spirit as translated into entrepreneurialism.  The point is that if you yearn to escape the stifling restrictions of the    nine-to-five in the corporate or state bureaucracy, your only alternative is    small business. Every artist is an entrepreneur because you have to do your    own tax and invoicing. In my talk I quoted GK Chesterton's famous quip, \"Too    much capitalism does not mean too many capitalists, but too few capitalists.\"    Most of us are working for the megamachine when we should be creating our    own mini-machines. This is why, in order to escape slavery and embrace    liberty, we need to face up to taking responsibility for our own lives as    traders.'I couldn't agree more. Steerforth Books may end up being a complete disaster, but I have to try."},

Like the ferns in this picture, I don't thrive in direct sunlight.On  the way back, I stopped in a farm shop (as the food in Waitrose just  isn't expensive enough) and was surprised to find it completely  deserted. I walked around the wooden floor with heavy, giant steps, but nobody came. Then I tried slamming down the  freezer lids more vigorously than usual, but still nothing.Minutes later, a ruddy-faced man came stumbling out of a door at the back of the shop and greeted me:\"Haven't  been waiting long, have you sir? Found what you want? Or perhaps what  your wife wants. Mind you, the wives don't know what we get up to when  we're on our own, do they?\"He gave a half wink that reminded me of a rather unpleasant uncle I once had.I smiled and nodded knowingly , thinking \"I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about\". Did he mean that, that or that?Sometimes ignorance is bliss."},

{"title": "The Horror", "date": "Sunday, September 25, 2011", "text": "This  afternoon, my oldest son and I caught a taxi to Ditchling Beacon and  walked home along the South Downs Way. My son didn't want to go, but he  is still young enough to be manipulated by false promises and cheap  incentives. Once he was up on the Downs, the grunting and shoulder  shrugging were replaced with animated conversations about serial killers  and horror films.It was a beautiful day, but halfway between  the summer and winter solstices, the light had a  muted quality, as if  the sun itself was failing.Frustratingly,  rather than feeling overwhelmed by the beauty of the landscape, my mind  played through a tracklist of annoying music: the theme tune of Lazy Town, a Sousa march, something by the Black-Eyed Peas, If You're Happy and You Know Clap Your Hands (my one gesture of defiance at primary school was to hold my hands wide apart during this song).Then  I started wondering if I hadn't made a terrible mistake when I handed  my notice in. Every other news story last week seemed to be about the  imminent collapse of the Western economy. Was this a good time to be  leaving paid employment and setting up a business? Was I even setting up  a business, or was I just quitting my job and pretending that I wasn't  unemployed?A man on a hang-glider hovered 50 feet above us,  gently rising with the thermals. It was so quiet and the air so still  that he must have heard my son's voice:\"Dad, ask me about any serial killer and I bet I'll have heard of them. Do you know about Leatherface? Do know what he did?\"Three  weeks ago he knew nothing about Leatherface, but now that my son has  started at secondary school he's suddenly a man of the world, determined  to earn respect from his peers with his encyclopaedic knowledge of  horror films that he has never actually seen. I hope.The walk from Ditchling Beacon is perfect: only six miles and  downhill all the way, with glorious views of the Weald on one side and  the coast on the other. It is mostly open countryside, following ancient  paths that enabled people to avoid the dense forests of the lowlands.  Sadly, wooded areas like 'Black Cap' are a rarity now:Further  on, Lewes appeared in the distance, so far away that like an astronaut  on the moon, I could blot it out with one hand. I liked the fact that it  was so finite. I had grown up in suburban London, where one town simply  merged into another, sometimes worse than the previous mile, sometimes  better.A young girl galloped past on a colt and I felt a vicarious rush of pleasure. My son turned to me:\"Dad, can we watch The Ring?  Not the original version - that's an 18, but the American one, because  that's only 15. Don't ask Mum, she'll say no. Can we? Several of my  friends at school have seen it.\"He reeled off a list of names that sounded like characters from Blake's Seven. Why aren't children just called John and Mary any more? I blame Dynasty and Home and Away.As we reached the outskirts of Lewes, I realised how many things had  changed in the last year. We'd had an awful time, but it hadn't  lasted. Seeing my mother, blissfully happy in her new home and my son,  confidently ambling home with his new friends at a school I never  thought we'd get him to, I felt relief more than joy; like someone who  has survived a storm at sea.We turned the corner into our road and I told my son that he'd just  walked six miles, rather than the three I'd led him to believe. \"You  didn't get even slightly tired. You should be proud of yourself.\"He turned to me. \"Dad, when we get home, will you watch Creep with me?\""},
{"title": "Birds, Cars and Wood", "date": "Sunday, September 18, 2011", "text": "Do you like vintage motor cars and wildfowl? Then Bentley Wildfowl and Motor Museum is the place for you.I can't say I've ever regarded birds and cars as natural bedfellows for a musuem (and the squashed pheasants on the driveway would seem to vindicate this view), but Bentley does have a strange, indefinable charm. If you're in the area and fancy a walk in beautiful surroundings, I'd recommend it.I took my wife and sons there today to visit a 'wood fair', which was as worthy and middle class as it sounds, but not quite as dull. My youngest son, who began the visit by sitting on the grass and shouting \"I HATE WOOD!\" gradually perked up once he realised that it could be deployed as a weapon:There was a slightly menacing, pre-apocalyptic atmosphere at the wood fair, as if people were preparing themselves for an imminent disaster. In addition to the usual selection of fairly hideous garden ornaments and obscure country crafts, I noticed a lot more knives and survival tools.I can see the temptation to become self-sufficient in an increasingly uncertain world. But if the oil ran out and things kicked off, what would happen? I once asked a man who was a bit of an old hippy and ran a smallholding what he would do. Without hesitating, he replied: \"Find the nearest gun shop and get tooled-up\".It wasn't quiet the answer I was expecting.To add to the surreal atmosphere, at one point I found myself sitting in the carriage of a miniature railway, travelling at 5mph, discussing The Wire with two 11-year-olds.At the wood fair we met a couple whose son was in the same class as ours. They had recently moved down from Stoke Newington and I found myself wondering if I would ever meet anyone in Lewes who didn't come from north London. I'm convinced that there is some sort of Stargate-style portal in Hackney that sucks middle-class people in once they have children and sends them off to Lewes, Southwold, North Norfolk and Brighton.Where do all the real Lewes people go?Actually, I did recently learn that a friend of my wife's came from St Margarets, only a mile or so from where I grew up in SW London. As children we'd been to the same parks, shops and cinemas, travelled on the same buses and, later, drank in the same pubs, but it had taken her years to bother mentioning where she came from.There was also something else that she took ages to reveal. Occasionally the friend would mention various members of her family, including a step-mother called Beryl. One day last year, she said that she was worried about her half-sister, as Beryl was dying of cancer and the funeral would probably be quite a big 'do' because Beryl had published a few novels and knew lots of people. My wife nodded sympathetically, then suddenly the penny dropped:\"Hang on, do you mean that Beryl?\"It's strange how we can sometimes talk so much about ourselves without revealling things that others would regard as fundamental.We had a good chat with the couple from Stoke Newington (at least as good as you can have within the context of constantly of being constantly interrupted by children) and at one point the husband asked me how long we'd lived in Lewes. I realised that it was ten years next month.\"Do you feel local?\"I hesitated and surprised myself with the answer: \"No. Not quite. It hasn't happened yet.\"My wife disagreed. Ten years of standing in playgrounds twice a day has given her a good network of friends and acquaintances. But my days have tended to involve getting in a car and driving somehere 25 miles away. Whenever I had a drink with someone, it usually took place in London.Perhaps I need to join something, but I'm not quite sure what.As we drove back to Lewes, I looked at the clouds over the South Downs and couldn't imagine living anywhere else. I may not be a local yet, but it does feel like home.That must count for something."},
{"title": "Turning the Key", "date": "Thursday, September 15, 2011", "text": "A beautiful day - a tantalising glimpse of the summer we never had. I don't know if it's anything to do with global warming, but the English summer now seems to take place in April and May, with a monsoon season in July and August. It's very odd.I had to drive to a farm to drop off a cheque for the deposit and first month's rent for Steerforth Books. I had no idea where I was going, but had been given a postcode for the satnav and blindly followed directions which took me onto increasingly narrower and emptier roads. I'd forgotten how sinister the English countryside can be (I blame this on watching reruns of the Avengers).I ended up driving for miles along a deserted lane, wondering if I was going to end up in a ditch with the satnav lady announcing \"You have now reached your destination\", whilst some grinning toothless locals began untying the string around their trousers. Fortunately this is Sussex, not the Appalachians.The farm turned out to be a beautiful, large Georgian house, with breathtaking views of the South Downs. I handed the cheque over and felt a pang of remorse for the fact that I will probably never be able to afford to live somewhere like this.Driving to the next destination, I listened to a podcast of 'Broadcasting House'. Francesca 'Horrid Henry' Simon, Tori Amos and a bloke whose name I never caught were talking about being in New York on 9/11. More recent events like the invasion of Iraq have faded into the recesses of my memory, but I remember September 11th as if it was yesterday.I arrived at Steerforth Books. Peter, the gentleman farmer, was out on his tractor doing agricultural things, but another man handed me the key and at last I was able to take possession of the new unit:It's not big, but if I'm clever about it I think I can get around 8,000 books in this room, which should be enough to generate a reasonable income. I won't get rich - most of the books won't sell - but hopefully the children will have shoes on their feet. The main challenge will be to find enough stock to reach this magic figure. I have a few potential sources.So Steerforth Books is almost a reality. I have a business account, domain name (com and co.uk), office unit and even a little bit of stock. I can't say that I'm looking forward to the sheer, unmitigated tedium of building 46 feet of shelving (and given my track record in DIY, it will probably collapse at some point), but without it there will be no Steerforth Books.In the meantime I'm still going into work, three days a week, getting things ready for my successor. It feels strange going through the motions of the working day, making decisions about a future that I won't be part of. I will be glad to leave the world of '9 to 5', but I'll also miss several people more than they probably realise.In some ways it feels like a very early retirement, leaving the 'real' world of work for a John Bull Printing Set fantasy. But work can simply be work. We don't have to be part of an organisation: commuting, attending meetings and working in open plan offices. Paunches and stomach ulcers are optional, not compulsory.But whilst a part of me relishes the idea of leaving office life behind, another part feels a deep sense of loss.No more talking about last night's telly. No more \"Did you see the quiz night Phil?\", followed by detailed postmortems of 'University Challenge' and 'Only Connect'. I have met some good people through work.I apologise if this blog has lost its 'mojo' at the moment. The amusing covers and photographs have been thin on the ground recently. I had hoped to publish one final installment of the Derek diaries, but - and you'll have to take my word for this - they are mostly very dull and I have struggled to find any more material that is worth publishing. I haven't completely given up.So until Steerforth Books is fully established, this blog will limp along like a consumptive war veteran, looking back to better days, hoping (perhaps unrealistically), for better times ahead.Finally, as far as a Steerforth Books logo is concerned, I have been particularly dim. When I first visited my new farm unit last week, I need only have turned my head 45 degrees to have seen one of the most striking 'logos' of all time:Nobody knows how old the possibly prehistoric Long Man of Wilmington is, or indeed why it's there, but in theory you can't miss it. I did.But then one September in 1995, I managed to spend a whole day travelling around Manhattan without noticing the twin towers of the World Trade Centre. The next morning I caught an American Airlines flight from Boston to Los Angeles, blissfully ignorant of what the future held."},
{"title": "Listening Without Prejudice", "date": "Sunday, September 11, 2011", "text": "You may want to just completely skip this post. It's about opera. I won't be offended if you do.I was looking forward to meeting some old friends in London yesterday, but sadly my stomach had other ideas. Instead, I have spent the weekend in a horizontal position, looking at YouTube clips and catching up with people's blogs.I found quite a few gems, including this post about Roddy McDowell's home movies, this beautifully-written anecdote and this photograph, which appeals in so many ways.However, the thing that gave me the most pleasure was finding this (best viewed in full screen mode):I went to see this performance of Shostakovich's 'Lady MacBeth of Mtsensk District' almost exactly five years ago and wasn't sure what to expect. I had never been to an opera before and had some deeply-held prejudices about overweight singers and overpaid audiences.I wasn't overjoyed when I discovered that the whole thing lasted for over three hours.However, it was a truly magical evening and at last, I understood why some people were so fanatical about opera. Aside from Shostakovich's wonderful music, which incensed Stalin so much he banned the opera immediately, I was bowled over by the set design, the costumes and the wonderful singing.Shostakovich wrote the opera in his 20s and the music buzzes with youthful energy and bawdy humour. I had imagined that the Royal Opera House would attract a rather stuffy crowd, but people were rocking with laughter at the saucy jokes and satirical digs.I don't like flying, but I'd travel halfway around the world to see this production again. Sadly, the airfare would probably still be cheaper than a seat in the balcony."},
{"title": "All at Sea", "date": "Wednesday, September 07, 2011", "text": "This morning I found a home for 'Steerforth Books': a small unit within a converted agricultural outbuilding, owned by a gentleman farmer called Peter*.I had wanted somewhere in Lewes, but this option makes much more financial sense for the time being. The rent is very reasonable and if my business turns out to be an unmitigated disaster, I only have to give a month's notice.I suppose that I should have visited lots of properties and carefully weighed up the options, but what's the point? I liked the office and I liked Peter. Also, with only three weeks left before I leave the comfortable world of paid employment, I need to get cracking.I'll hopefully take possession of the unit next week and my first priority will be to install shelving for up to 10,000 books. I had thought of doing the shelves myself, but I've no desire to suffer the same fate as the French composer Alkan, who was killed by a falling bookcase. I think I'll ask an expert.After the shelving, I need to sort out internet access, buy some desks and chairs and set up seller accounts on marketplaces like Amazon. Once that's done, I can start ordering the stock. None of this will feel real until I actually have some books.At some point during the next few months, I'll also launch a website. I've been think of a logo and have scoured the internet for images of the original Steerforth from David Copperfield, but this was all I can find:Steerforth all at sea? I'm not sure if it sends out the right signals.Does anyone have any bright ideas for a logo or accompanying font? Most of my stock will be general titles from the 20th and late 19th centuries, with a few rare and antiquarian books thrown in. I certainly won't be 'high end', but I don't want to look like the bargain basement either.What sort of things would you find reassuring or attractive as a buyer if you stumbled across Steerforth Books on the internet?I'm resigned to opening a Twitter account, wading through the tedium of Google analytics and  possibly beginning a new Facebook page (although I think that Facebook has 'jumped the shark').Failing that, I could go viral with a book-related video on YouTube. 'Happy slapping' is so last decade, so perhaps a flashmob in the reading room of the British Library, or my five-year-old son and his friends dressing up in their Fireman Sam outfits and recreating 'Fahrenheit 451' would grab some attention? I'm not convinced.Maybe I should just stick to selling good books at a slightly cheaper price than everyone else, wrap them in decent packaging and make sure that they're posted promptly?Anyway, any suggestions would be much appreciated.* NB - By 'gentleman farmer', I mean a farmer who is a gentleman, not a man of leisure who dabbles in farming."},
{"title": "The Language Problem", "date": "Saturday, September 03, 2011", "text": "During the last year I've been trying to learn French. It has been a struggle, as I'm not very good at learning languages (I achieved the lowest mark for Welsh in the history of the University of Wales). The only time I have been able to pick up a language is when I've been immersed in another culture, cut off from English speakers.\r\rI like to tell myself that this is because I am a musical person who learns aurally rather than visually. But it could just be that I'm bone idle and only pick things up when deprived of any alternative. Either way, in an ideal world I would spend a few months working behind the bar at Chez Jacques, interacting with the locals to the point where, months later, Parisians would be appalled by my strong Toulouse accent.\r\rSadly, work and family committments have meant that it was unlikely that I would ever be pouring a glass of Ricard for Monsieur Bertillon, so I had to find a compromise.\r\rAt one point I joined an evening class, but soon discovered that it was actually a dating agency for middle-aged divorcees, masquerading as an educational course. As an alternative, I tried the traditional book and CD route, but it was really hard to assess how well I'd done. What was the answer?\r\rAfter a long search, I found an internet course that combined traditional teaching methods (books - remember them?) with videos and exercises, where I could record myself and be assessed by native speakers. I could also join a social networking site and make friends with people in Francophone countries. Parfait!\r\rUnfortunately the reality was a little disappointing. The feedback on my exercises amounted to little more than 'tres bien'! One or two brave souls remarked that my accent wasn't all it could be, but practical tips were thin on the ground.\r\rThe social networking didn't quite live up to expectations either:\r\rThis young woman is from the Ukraine and, as far as I can tell, doesn't speak French. However, she does have a fine collection of commemorative plates celebrating military helicopters. I'm not sure why she's wearing angel wings.\r\rThe French course taught me enough to ask a wide range of questions, but sadly left me completely unprepared for the answers. In some ways, knowing a bit of a language is worse than knowing nothing. It was humiliating.\r\rI have decided to take a break from French for a while and try German, which seems to be easier in many ways, as it's more closely related to English. But there are two possible problems. First, I'm a little concerned that my pronunciation strays too easily into war film German: \"Achtung! Fünf, vier, drei, zwei, eins...\". Second, they have those terrifyingly long words, like betäubungsmittelverschreibungsverordnung. There's no excuse for that.\r\rPerhaps I should just stick to French. But I'd rather speak three foreign languages badly than one reasonably well.\r\rWhen I was 26 I went to Lanzarote. I didn't speak a word of Spanish and had an unfortunate incident which ended with me being dumped in a lava field at 2.00 in the morning, surrounded by hostile dogs. It was horrible and I know that if I'd been able to speak some Spanish, however badly, things would have been different.\r\r(Fortunately, after wandering across the lava field for an hour, I was rescued by some local lads in a jeep who helped me find my house, driving at ridiculous speeds in the dark, along dirt tracks with terrifying vertiginous slopes. Once we found where I was staying, I invited them in for a drink and as they left, one of them suddenly handed me a huge lump of dope and said, with a grin, \"See you in Hell\")\r\rAfter that experience, I learned some Spanish and reached a point where, a few years later in Chile, I was able to book hotel rooms and train tickets in Spanish over the phone. It was exhilirating.\r\rBut unless you have a particular affinity with one nation or linguistic group, does it make sense to limit your options? Wouldn't it be better to learn the essential 1000 words in several languages, unless you're one of those nauseating people who are naturally fluent in six languages? In the early part of the 20th century, some people would have had a simple answer: Esperanto.\r\rSadly, Esperanto is largely forgotten and I wouldn't be surprised if the most popular artificial language of today is Klingon. What a waste of time.\r\rIf anyone has any tips for learning a language that don't involve working in a bar for a year, I'd be interested to hear them."},
{"title": "A Day Out", "date": "Monday, August 29, 2011", "text": "Last week we travelled up to East Anglia to visit my wife's great-aunt for lunch. It was a ridiculously long drive in torrential rain, during which I battled to resist the soporific effect of the windscreen wipers and a Noel Coward play on the radio. At one point, everyone else in the car was asleep and I only had the 'satnav' lady to keep me company, with her annoying rising inflection: \"At the next roundabout? Take the second exit? Then take the road to Lowestoft?\"\r\rI'd never visited the great-aunt's house before, but had wondered why such a nice, cultured woman lived in a place like Lowestoft. In addition to being the easternmost point of Great Britain, Lowestoft is one of the most economically depressed areas in the country. It has a terrible reputation.\r\rHowever, as the satnav announced \"You have reached your destination?\", I entered a leafy road full of beautiful Victorian villas and realised how blinkered I had been. Lowestoft may be economically depressed due to problems in the fishing industry, but like Hastings and Margate, it is largely unspoiled and has retained its character. All it needs now is a high-speed rail link to north London and a modern art gallery.\r\rFrom the outside, the great-aunt's house seemed untouched by the 20th century, let alone the 21st; I almost expected a maid to appear at the door. But I didn't think that the Victorian theme would continue once we were inside:\r\rThis photo doesn't do justice to the beauty of this house. The great-aunt's son - an antiques restorer and dealer - has filled the house with beautiful objects and said that he tries to lead a plastic-free existence.\r\rHe and his sister had prepared a lavish candlelit lunch, with fine bone china, silver cutlery and lead crystal glasses. With a grandfather clock ticking gently in the background, it felt as if we were still waiting for 1900 to arrive.\r\rI complimented the son on a beautiful sideboard, which looked as if it should be in a museum. He replied that he had bought it when he was 16. What sort of teenager goes around buying antique furniture? Later, I learned that when he was in his teens, the son and his best friend used to dress up as Queen Victoria and drink tea from very expensive china.\r\rI was also told that when the son was sent to Austria on a school skiing trip that he didn't want to go on, he used to sneak away from the ski slopes and spend the whole day in the local village, buying objets d'art and porcelain. When the son's deception was discovered, the master took him to one side and said \"Do you know what a homosexual is?\"\r\rI left the house feeling inspired by what I'd seen, but depressed by the ordinariness of my own home. I used to seek out beautiful things, but as soon as I became a parent I stopped bothering. I could blame it on money, but several of the objects I saw in Lowestoft had come from car boot sales.\r\rI think it was more to do with the belief that a self-indulgent period in my life was over and it was time to create a more child-centred home, full of clean, new utilitarian furniture. What nonsense. Have my son's lives been enhanced by a glut of plastic toys and flatpack self-assembly furniture?\r\rI still have a few things that I value: a Swedish barometer with art noveau lettering, some chairs that used to belong to Jade Jagger, a Victorian clock with a plaque dedicated to 'Mr and Mrs Ashdown of the Plumtree Ragged School' and an old bakelite phone that was owned by the BBC.\r\rBut overall, I have allowed too much junk to creep into my life. I look longingly at blogs like Grey Area and marvel at the beauty of other people's homes.\r\rLuckily, my house is so strange anyway, that no amount of flatpack furniture could completely destroy its character, but it deserves better than an Ikea table and an Argos chest of drawers. As I'm about to embark on my new career as the Lovejoy of books, perhaps I should add antiques to my portfolio."},
{"title": "Grey is the Colour of Hope", "date": "Saturday, August 27, 2011", "text": "I  popped into the Colchester branch of Waterstone's this morning to see  if the recent change of ownership  had made any difference. At first, it  looked exactly the same, but then I noticed that the shelves seemed  much fuller and there were very few annoying posters with banal bylines.\r\rIt felt more like a bookshop.\r\rI  suppose it was unrealistic to expect anything dramatic; after all,  James Daunt's only been in the job for a couple of months. I shall have  to go back later in the year.\r\rI must have been scrutinising the  shop a little too conspicuously, as a nervous-looking assistant made a  beeline for me and asked if I needed any help. I think they thought that  I was a mystery shopper. I was tempted to play along and start asking ridiculous question, but thought better of it.\r\rI've never been a  mystery shopper, but I used to pretend to be a restaurant critic. I'd  dress smartly and turn up with a small clipboard, pretending to  surreptitiously take notes which I made a great play of concealing every time a waiter approached. After ordering, I'd inspect the loos and  ensure that I 'accidentally' walked into the kitchen, scanning the surfaces for any signs of dirt. As the evening  progressed the waiters became increasingly attentive and at some point,  I'd invariably end up getting at least one free drink (a decent one, not a  thimblefull of Bailey's).\r\rAt the end of the visit, the waiters  would wait by the door and, with anxious smiles, ask me if I'd had an  enjoyable evening. I'd nod knowingly and reply \"A very enjoyable evening indeed.\" Their relief was palpable.\r\rWas that wrong? I never actually claimed to be anything I wasn't; I just let people infer it from my behaviour. Either way, it was good fun.\r\rBut  I digress. Returning to Waterstone's, the shop looked good and it was  packed, so perhaps there's still some hope for the high street bookshop.  I hope so. The way everyone is talking about the 'Kindle', it feels as if the question about the demise of bricks and mortar bookselling is not if, but when.\r\rHowever, I have uncovered evidence of a failed attempt at Kindle-style reading from the 1940s:\r\rThis  book was published during the Second World War and although it looks  perfectly ordinary on the outside, the contents reveal a bold new  initiative in the publishing world. Black on grey:\r\r\"Black text on a grey background? It'll never work, Carstairs. It looks damnably awful!\"\r\rAnd that was the end of that. The book industry had to wait another 65 years before the Kindle made grey backgrounds acceptable.\r\rBut sometimes grey can be good:\r\rI love cover designs like this from the 1960s, which have an elegance, simplicity and wit that has never been surpassed. In this post, Richard from Grey Area posted a comment that pointed out how much work went into creating such seemingly effortless designs.\r\rJust a few years before 'Choral Verse', dustjackets like this were the norm:\r\rThis  is a sex education book for young people from the late 1950s. I'm no  expert on these matters, but I would have thought that the first thing  they could do is take their raincoats off.\r\rBut I mustn't mock. It's  actually quite a good book, full of dangerous, radical ideas, like  trying to see things from the woman's perspective.\r\rI'm not sure if these women needed any advice with delicate matters:\r\r\rIn  the second picture, the urban sophisticate deals with a group of  'brigands' with barbed wit and condescension. I've tried that approach  too, but with more mixed results.\r\rThere's something very appealing about the demi-monde  of the period between the wars, but I'm also attracted to the innocence  of children's book illustrations from the mid-20th century:\r\rI  expect that these children were called Peter, Joan, Colin and Kenneth  and their parents didn't mind them sitting on the edge of tall buildings  in the dark, because they were too busy getting 'tight' at the local yacht  club.\r\rFinally, four photos that turned up at work last week:\r\r\rA very moody shot. Perhaps it's all a little too English for this gentleman.\r\rThe sporting Scotsmen theme continues with this appealing portrait of a young boy.\r\rThis couple are also from Scotland, but there's no evidence of any sporting activity.\r\rFinally, a slightly disturbing portrait of Father Christmas:\r\rI'm  not sure what effect this Santa would have had on the young visitors to  his grotto, but I'm sure that it can't have been as bad as the New York  department store that had a sign outside which promised: 'FIVE SANTAS. NO WAITING.'"},

Everyone has been very kind, but I could  have done without the two colleagues who asked me if I was retiring.\r\rDo I really look that old?\r\rAdmitedly it's been a hard year, but I didn't think I looked that bad. I  have a good 20 years left before I retire (probably longer, if the Government have their way) and can't say I feel like someone who's about to draw their pension.\r\rPerhaps I'm fooling myself. In the spirit of objectivity, I took this 'warts and all' photo of myself an hour ago:\r\rIt's  a sad contrast to the photo in my last post. I am a shadow of my former  self: hair has been lost and weight has been gained, but does this  really look like someone who is about to retire?\r\rI only hope that they  meant early retirement. Very early retirement.\r\rThings didn't get any better today. I had an appointment at the  optician's and was pleased to see that my eye test was being done by a  very attractive woman. She had long blonde hair, a strange tattoo on her  leg and a breathy voice that sounded as if she was acting very badly. For a moment I thought I'd been transported  into a porn film and waited patiently for her to complain how hot the room was and start loosening her clothing. But instead she began telling me that I had  reached the age where I should consider getting varifocal lenses.\r\rVarifocal lenses? Great!

But not here:\r\rPreferably somewhere warm and exotic, like these photos from 1979:\r\rI  found these pictures in an old Selfix photo album that turned up at  work last week. Sadly, they weren't actual photographs, but pictures  that someone had cut out of a holiday brochure - a whole album's worth.  Why would someone go to so much effort?\r\rWhy not relax with a complimentary glass of Dubonet and a cigarette, while Jacques plays 'Misty' for you, before boogieing the night away to the latest Patrick Juvet smash hit...\r\rAnd in the morning you can sample the local crafts and historical buildings...\r\rAfter  lunch, why not not take advantage of our exclusive 'Members Only' club  facilities? If tennis isn't your scene, you can relax with the latest  Harold Robbins in our new library room...\r\rIt looks like the sort of place where you'd bump into Roger Moore.\r\rAnyway, I must go now before the cocoa boils over.\r\r(Now where did I put my slippers?)\r\rN.B - Since writing this post, I have been out for curry with a lovely person 41 years older than me. She drank me under the table. I need to listen to Dale Carnegie: 'Stop Worrying and Start Living'!"},

For the first time in ages, I can hear nothing but the sound of death watch beetles and the floorboards expanding and contracting as the sun rises and falls. It is a guilty pleasure.\r\rWhen I first met my wife, I refused to believe that there was an island off the coast of Essex. It all sounded too Enid Blyton. Then I went to stay with her and visited her grandparents' vast Tudor farmhouse. I'd never been to a home with a grand piano before, let alone two (the second one was in the nursery) and felt as if I'd been sent to live in a novel.\r\rMy wife's grandparents' heyday was in the 1940s and 50s. Fifty years on, the men still wore pencil-thin moustaches and drank double whiskies, before staggering into their Rovers for the drive home at a steady 23mph. It seemed such a solid world and I felt overwhelmed by it. But within only a few years they were all dead and the Tudor farmhouse, which echoed with the sound of glasses clinking, risqué jokes and druken renditions of 'A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square', was silent.\r\rIt was a world of certainties and a sense of belonging: the yacht club, the Masons, the Conservatives and the golf club. If there was a dinner dance, Nanny looked after the children. Later, boarding school ensured that the social calendar went ahead without any disruptions.\r\rI wonder what my wife's grandparents made of me, with my strange boots and long black coats, all bought from charity shops:\r\rI looked a total prat. But to their credit, my wife's grandparents were never anything less than charming. I suppose they'd seen it all before.\r\rMy wife's grandfather once took her to one side and asked what my 'prospects' were. She roared with laughter. I'm not sure if she's laughing now, living in a house that's less than a fifth of the size of the one she grew up in, but luckily she still feels relieved that she didn't end up with a nice young man from the yacht club.\r\rMy prospects are still uncertain. I hope that 'Steerforth Books' will at least pay the bills and put bread on the table, but there is still a lot of work to be done.

Why didn't I spend my time reading a novel or watching an Ingmar Bergman film, rather than typing 'skateboarding chimps' in the search box?\r\rI blame it on stress.\r\rBut I find that if you spend enough time on YouTube, you invariably stumble on something wonderful.\r\rThis evening I started looking at clips of 'What's My Line' from the late 1950s and early 60s, marvelling at the quality of the guests, e.g. Salvador Dali, Alfred Hitchcock and Eleanor Roosevelt. No E-list former reality tv contestants or failed pop stars, although there was a slightly bizarre appearance from Colonel Sanders (who looked exactly like the Kentucky Fried Chicken picture).\r\rMy favourite 'What's My Line' clip featured Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward. I remember reading articles about Newman and Woodward's marriage and the subtext was always \"here's a man who could have any woman he wants and yet he's chosen to remain faithful to his wife who, let's face it, is no glamourpuss, although she's a formidable character...\" \r\rHowever, on the strength of this clip, I can see exactly why Paul Newman fell in love with Joanne Woodward and remained happily married to her until his death. Apart from being beautiful and elegant, she radiates intelligence, wit and a sense of fun.\r\rI think I'm a bit in love with Joanne Woodward too:\r\r\r\rN.B - Since writing this post, I've discovered that there are rumours that Dorothy Killgalen - described by Frank Sinatra as the 'chinless wonder' - may have been assassinated!"},

I knew that they regarded me as a  permanent fixture and had planned accordingly. Would they be angry,  indifferent or sympathetic?\r\rSo far, everyone has been brilliant. Indeed, they've even offered to  help me find a way of setting-up in Lewes and I've been told that if my  circumstances change, I can go back. I couldn't ask for more.\r\rNow comes the hard bit. I have to find a unit in Lewes that's large  enough to store a few thousand books. It doesn't matter what state of  repair the building's in as long as it's dry. It also needs to be  accessible for lorries and vans. Finally, I need a short lease in case I  turn out to be utterly useless at running my own business.\r\rIn the meantime, I will be in my current job for at least another month,  paving the way for my successor, so I'll continue to share the latest  discoveries:\r\r\rThis book appears to be very rare. I can't find any other copies of it  on sale. The flyleaf has a Guernsey bookseller's name blind-stamped in  the corner, whilst the front endpaper has this bookplate:\r\rI was surprised to find a bookplate for an English prize in French, but later realised that it was actually in Guernésiais  - a Norman French dialect that remained the island's official language  until 1972. Today, only 2% of the population speak it fluently, but when  Victor Hugo was in exile on Guernsey, writing Les Miserables, Guernésiais was commonly spoken.\r\rThe language declined for the usual reasons, but was accelerated when  many of the island's children were evacuated to the British mainland at  the beginning of World War two.\r\rAs for the book, it has some beautiful colour illustrations accompanying a military-themed ABC:\r\r\rCan you guess what each letter stands for? I've already thought of some (which are unrepeatable).\r\rIn addition to the ABC illustrations, there are also some full colour plates:\r\r\rThe  final scene clearly shows that rioting isn't a modern phenomenon, but  in the Victorian age they disguised themselves with clown suits instead  of hoodies. The police response doesn't appear to have changed very  much.\r\rThat's the nearest I get to writing about the riots. I have very strong  opinions about why they happened and what could be done to prevent  future unrest, but like most of the UK population I didn't witness any  of these disturbances. I've lived in thoroughly middle-class Lewes for  ten years and London feels a world away.\r\rMaybe it's time for me to go to Tottenham and get down with the kids."},

Had they discovered that I hadn’t ordered my post-it notes from the preferred supplier?  I did the walk of shame through the vast open-plan office and noticed eyes quickly dart in my direction. I tried to look as nonchalant as possible, but sensed that my face was glowing. It had to be bad news.    I sat down and listened to what sounded like a preamble to something unpleasant. The managing director showed me a series of spreadsheets with figures that seemed to merge into each other and talked about budgets and long-term strategies. Then he came to the point. My department was now the most profitable part of the business and it was time to think about the future.  It slowly dawned on me that this wasn’t bad news.

I needed to work in Lewes; preferably for myself, as this would give me the flexibility that I needed.\r  Today I handed in my resignation. In October I will be self-employed for the first time in my life. The whole thing feels unreal and slightly terrifying, but I am absolutely certain that I have made the right decision.  I will need to have enough money to pay for food and bills, so I’m planning to do what I do now on a smaller scale: Steerforth Books. I’ve also been offered a few pieces of work by other people, so I hope that between running a small business and doing a few short-term projects, I’ll survive.\r  I may just have made one of the silliest decisions of my life, but somehow I don't think so.\r(By the way, this blog is five years old today.

When I was a boy, there was a shoe shop in the road next to mine that had been opened by two brothers in the 1930s. It occupied the ground floors of two adjacent houses. One half contained a shoe repair workshop, where the brothers could usually be found; the other contained a showroom with countless boxes of shoes. I used to buy my Clarks Commandos there.The workshop was like a time capsule. Nothing had been changed for 50 years and the fixture and fittings were all painted in a shade of brown that had probably become obsolete in 1949.Even when the brothers were in their seventies, they continued to work, buffing leather shoes over ancient lathes. They finally retired in the early 1990s.I love this idyllic photograph for so many reasons. It was about to be binned, so I'm very glad that it will now be seen by more people than ever.I receive lots of old photograph albums at work. Many contain nothing more than snapshots which are of little interest to anyone; but the best have images that are either historically or artistically appealing. This photo may just be the work of an amateur who was having an 'artistic moment', but it doesn't deserve to be consigned to oblivion.Is that graffiti? So much for the good old days.This is a slightly creepy photograph: a man who looks like a waxwork dummy and a woman holding a doll. Very odd.This is a bit of a Caspar David Friedrich scene, with the protagonist squaring up against the forces of nature.This is a rare, naturalistic 'Monday is washday' scene. No Sunday best here.A ridiculously large hat.The first recorded sighting of a Kindle.This is a very touching photo (assuming that rabbit stew was not on the menu).This pensive pose is an early example of flash photography (look at the shadow in the background).This Danny Kaye lookalike would have loved a full-blown Hammond organ. Perhaps he lived long enough to see one.Finally, a picnic scene. The location and identity of these people will always be a mystery - I wish that I could transport myself back there, as they look as if they're having fun.When I was 20, I met an elderly Welsh farmer on the outskirts of Lampeter. He looked at me and said \"Ydych yn siarad Cymraeg?\"I replied that I knew a little (I'd worked in a Welsh-speaking pub during the National Eisteddfod of Wales), but it would be a very limited conversation. He immediately switched to English and, like a man possessed, told me that I must sort out my photos:\"Write the names and dates on the back of all of your photographs. I've got albums and I don't know who they are. It's gone. Forgotten. I can't tell my sons who these people are. They're strangers.

Several people commented  that very little had changed since my last visit. Of course this isn't  true, but the four miles of water that separates the Island (as the  locals refer to it) from the English mainland does give the place a very  separate identity, almost as if it inhabits an alternate reality.It's not quite Britain in the 1950s, but it doesn't feel like the 21st century either.Here are a few things I loved about the Isle of Wight:1. The walk to the Needles Old Battery:It's  almost a mile from the car park to the Victorian coastal defence at the  southwestern tip of the island - not a huge distance, but enough to  deter the hoi polloi from ruining the tranquil atmosphere.2. The Isle of Wight Railway:Where  else would you find a 1938 tube train in the middle of the English  countryside? This isn't a 'heritage' line for tourists, but a genuine  passenger service, using reconditioned London Underground rolling stock.The  journey from Ryde begins in a long tunnel and for a minute, listening  to the the familiar clunks and whirs of the electric motors, it feels as  if you're on the District Line approaching Sloane Square. When the  train emerges into the English countryside, the juxtaposition of such  unlikely elements feels like a very strange dream:London Underground stations look nothing like this.Or this:3. Red Squirrels:You  can't see them, but they can see you. Unlike their big, brash American  cousins, who now dominate the mainland, the native British squirrel is  petite and discreet.  I had to wait patiently in some dense undergrowth  before I was rewarded with my David Attenborough moment: a red squirrel  (tiny little thing) resting on a branch, making a series of strange  squeals and clicks.The next day I nearly ran one over.I  expect the BNP like the Isle of Wight. It's almost entirely white  working class (I struggled in vain to find my favourite brand of  balsamic vinegar), with very few of those annoying, Guardian-reading  London types like me who push the property prices up with their art galleries  and organic cafes. Even the squirrels are thoroughly British.4. The Roman Villa in Newport:Actually  it's quite boring and I feel sorry for anyone who has got excited by  the brown sign announcing a 'Roman Villa', only to find themselves  looking at a floor. It's a very nice floor, with lots of impressive  mosaics, but it's not a villa. I'm sure that people have been prosecuted  for less misleading descriptions.However, what I liked about  the Roman villa in Newport is its incongruous location, situated in a  dull-looking bungalow in a quiet residential road, a few doors down from  the house we were staying in. Apparently the villa strays into next  door's garden, but the previous owners didn't want to ruin their patio  and it remains buried to this day.5. Osborne HouseThis  was Queen Victoria's favourite residence because it provided a  sanctuary from a world in which she was routinely \"mobbed by crowds\",  enabling her to enjoy a relatively normal life with her husband and  children.The coast of mainland England is visible from the gardens, but reassuringly distant:The interior of the house wasn't my cup of tea: hideously opulent furnishings and objets d'art,  complemented with badly-lit, poorly-executed oil paintings by forgotten  masters. It didn't help that I kept bumping into an annoying mother and  daughter, who made loud, confident pronouncements like \"They didn't have magazines in the Victorian times.\" The daughter was probably ten years younger than me, but every time  we reached a staircase she wheezed and complained with each step.  Instead of advising her daughter to eat fewer doughnuts, the mother  agreed.I had almost given up hope of seeing anything I liked,  but Queen Victoria's bedroom more than made up for the disappointment of  the rest of the house. To see the bed where Victoria died and look up  at the ceiling decorations that she must have stared at countles times  was very moving. I tried to imagine the scene - only 110 years ago - in  which the dying Queen was attended to by her servants, physician and  loved ones, but just as I started to lose myself, the mother and  daughter appeared:\"Oh yes, she was a very respectful lady...\"Fortunately  they didn't stay long. But as they left, two attendants decided to  begin a detailed comversation about their dogs' health and the resulting  vet bills. I gave up.One other thing I liked about Osborne  House was the gallery devoted to Indian nobles. It looked as if Queen  Victoria took her role as Empress of India very seriously, devoting  several rooms to portraits of maharajas and artifacts from the  subcontinent.I had no idea that Victoria went to great pains to learn Urdu and a  display case showed a page from an exercise book in which she had  written several passages in the local script. Perhaps the recent memory  of the Indian Mutiny had prompted a more respectful attitude on the part  of the British.But even if you don't like vulgar, excessively  ornate 19th century interiors, Osborne House is worth visiting for the  beauty of its grounds. The formal gardens had an idyllic, arcadian  quality; like a ruined Greek temple:However, at the edge of the grounds through a gap in the trees, I caught a glimpse of my true arcadia:6. Carisbrooke Castle:There  isn't much to say about Carisbrooke Castle; it's just a beautiful place  with a wonderful panorama of the surrounding countryside. Charles I was  held prisoner here after Parliament had won the English Civil War and  although it can't have been a terribly happy time for him, at least he  had a room with a view:After  exploring the grounds, I went to the tea shop and ordered a cup of tea  and a slice of cake (it's a rock n'roll life). Instead, I got a pot of  tea and a huge wedge of Victoria sponge. No wonder there's an obesity  crisis.I've noticed that portions have doubled in size over the  last 20 years, with a standard packet of crisps going from 20g to 40g. I  can understand why this has happened: a manufacturer who sells a 15p  slice of cake for £1.70 can now sell a 30p wedge of Victoria sponge for  £3.40, making almost £2 additional profit for doubling the portion.But  the end result is that I'm stuck on a staircase behind a 30 year-old  woman who is wheezing like a consumptive war veteran. It's not good.In  the tea shop, I was joined by a couple who spoke in a loud nasal accent  about how \"taahribly entrahsted\" they were in the Castle's past:\"In  Tennesse we met a chap who claimed that he was descended from one of  the signatories of Charle's I's death warrant. He seemed convinced that  because of this he wouldn't be allowed into England and nothing we said  could change his mind...\"There was a pause.\"Still, perhaps he wouldn't be let in for other reasons! Hwah, hwah, hwah!\"I was happy in Carisbrooke Castle, but all my sons wanted to do was go  back to the house and continue playing with the Wii. My youngest son  complained that \"you're taking us out all the time. This is the worst day of my life since the start of the world.\" It was very frustrating to realise that all my sons wanted to do was  stay in and play computer games. I'd vaguely entertained the idea of  buying a Wii - I'd fallen for the marketing spiel about getting families  to play together, but it's bollocks. All of these games suck the  imagination dry, replacing original thought with predetermined scenarios  and ghastly soundtracks that repeat the same leitmotifs, ad nauseum.Worst of all, I was also becoming addicted to the Wii. When, on the last  morning, I realised that I was the first person to wake up, I crept  downstairs to see if I could beat the high score in Wii Sports. I'd  developed a genuine dislike of a character called Martin, who kept  stopping me get to the next level. I had a score to settle with him:But  I haven't completely lost hope. I'd say that the moment when we were  all at our happiest was on a summer's evening, walking along the cliff  tops to the Old Needles Battery. Away from the distractions of the Wii  and the temptations of 'family' theme parks (our one vist to a theme  park lasted for a mere 15 minutes, as a girl vomitted in front of us  within 10 seconds of arriving and my son got stung by a bee), we managed  to find our 'mojo'.Sometimes the best things in life are free."},
{"title": "The Stephen Fry Mystery", "date": "Sunday, July 24, 2011", "text": "This morning, I took my younger son to a rather strange open air museum of industrial archaeology which, given its mostly odd-looking visitors and large collection of redundant machinery, felt like some sort of post-apocalyptic settlement. I liked it.However, on the way there, I passed somewhere that was far superior in the post-apocalyptic stakes: Shoreham Cement Works. Closed in 1991, the works consist of two huge abandoned factories that look like something out of Tarkovsky's masterpiece, Stalker.On the western side of a road that cuts through the works, there is an abandoned office building:As you can see, there is some writing on the wall under the top row of windows:'FRY \"POSH\" BORE'?Why would somebody go to the effort of breaking into an abandoned factory next to a rural minor road, just so that they could paint an anti-Stephen Fry slogan?I know that Fry's status as a 'national treasure' isn't universally accepted, but this seems a rather strange form of protest. The only suspect that springs to mind - Simon Gray - died three years ago.It's a mystery.Also, haven't they heard of Twitter? Stephen Fry certainly has."},
{"title": "The Colourful 1890s", "date": "Friday, July 22, 2011", "text": "I was going to call this post 'Dr Barnardo's Bubbles', but then I remembered all of those annoying, possessive book titles that seemed to be a craze in the publishing world after 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin', so I decided against it.Yesterday I found a children's annual from the 1890s, edited by Dr Barnardo. Like many annuals of this period, it contains a selection of mawkish, sentimental short stories and rather dull, worthy articles. This copy was given as a present to a boy called Herbert:It's a brief message, but in true Victorian fashion, Mrs Thwaite Metcalfe manages to squeeze in a quick reference to her son's eventual demise.I wonder what Herbert thought when he unwrapped his present from Mama on Christmas Day? Perhaps his heart sank when he saw that the package was book-shaped, rather than toy steam engine-shapped. However, he might have changed his mind once he opened the pages, as this is no ordinary annual. Unlike most books of this period, 'Bubbles' is packed with attractive, full page colour illustrations covering a variety of themes: fairy tales, Bible stories, scenes from the Empire and portraits of the deprivation and poverty that Barnardo fought to alleviate. In the 1890s, it must have seemed miraculous.It has been observed that if you want to really want to get the flavour of a particular period, you should eschew great art in favour of the second rate, the ephemeral and the commercial. I'm not completely convinced by this argument, but the following illustrations probably tell us a lot more about late-Victorian society than any Van Gogh painting:And finally, here is the back cover:I'm sure that young Herbert loved these bright, colourful illustrations. But I bet he never read the short stories."},
{"title": "\"Life is Better When You Know More\"", "date": "Wednesday, July 20, 2011", "text": "This post contains a random selection of things that have turned up at work during the last week.I suspect that most of them have come from house clearances. Some are book-related, but many aren't and I often wonder how they ever make it as far as my desk. However, I'm glad that they do.First, a 1960s maths textbook. Although I'm a child of the 70s, I vaguely remember covers like this one. I took them for granted at the time, but today I'm struck by how well designed they are:Much better than this drab, utilitarian cover from a decade earlier:I wonder if Brian was aware that he was the object of passionate desires?Staying in the 1950s, I found a 1951 children's annual and when I opened it, this was the first thing I saw:Okay, I thought, values have changed and I mustn't jump to conclusions. I'll try another page:At this point I gave up.In another 1950s book, I found a leaflet advertising the Chambers Encyclopaedia:I don't think any of us would take issue with that. But in a list of reasons why learning is good, I wonder how many people would come up with the fifth point:\"So, why do you want to enrol on this degree course Mr Pettigrew?\"  \"Because I wish to increase my television enjoyment.\"The leaflet was used as a bookmark, as was this envelope addressed to my favourite actor, Paul Scofield:Sadly the letter was missing.I'm sure that Paul Scofield would have enjoyed this shocking photo:Victorians caught on camera smiling and playing cards. Outrageous!Next, five portraits of someone on the journey from childhood to adulthood (alternate title: from hairdo to hairdon't):And they say the 70s was the decade that style forgot! However, mullets aside, I found these photos fascinating. Most of us have albums that depict our own tortuous paths to adulthood, but the evidence is usually too gradual and cluttered with extraneous detail to convey the magitude of this great transformation.These photos starkly convey the huge, sometimes terrifying changes that we undergo. I only wish that these pictures covered ten years instead of five.However, by coincidence I discovered this fascinating sequence of portraits of a girl, taken between 1970 and 1982. I'd just watched a 1970s children's programme on DVD and Googled the names of the cast to see what had happened to them. The younger actors seemed to vanish into obscurity, but one of them  - Shelley Crowhurst - popped up on the website of photographer Howard Grey.Finally, while I can accept that photos, diaries and leaflets are book-related, what about this:As someone in the warehouse said \"80 bob? That's £4! A lot of money in those days.\"Why did it end up on my desk? Because, I later found out, someone in the warehouse thought that I was the sort of person who'd probably have a projector. They were right!It took a while to find my dad's old cine projector amongst the collection of things in the loft that I never use, but can't bring myself to throw away. However, after a long search, this afternoon I watched 'Flat Mates'. I appreciated its subversive narrative structure - the women are naked at the beginning but become increasingly clothed as the film progresses - but felt that it was let down by the cinematography and direction.Overall, it has been a strange week, but rarely dull."},
{"title": "Moved", "date": "Saturday, July 16, 2011", "text": "Last Friday my mother left the home she has lived in since 1963 (she  knows where she was when Kennedy died) and moved to a sheltered  accommodation flat in Lewes. I had no idea how she was going to react to  the change and worried that beyond her facade of stoic resignation, my  mother might feel utterly miserable, but to my relief she seems  blissfully happy in her new home. It's as if she has been released from a  terrible burden.The process of moving was quite  frenetic. I'd been given ten days' notice and, in addition to working  full time, I had to find a removal company, decorate the flat, get a  carpet laid, install an electric cooker and assemble several kits of  flatpack furniture.Finding a removal company was particularly  difficult: three answerphones (one of which had a 'comedy' message) and a  wrong number. The final call also seemed liked a wrong number, as the  phone was answered by an aristocratic gentleman called Peter,who sounded  as if he'd taken too many drugs in the 60s.The phone  call began awkwardly, as Peter seemed reluctant to commit himself to  anything, including the nature of his business. Perahps it was a wrong  number, but I was desperate. Could Peter move my mother's possessions to  Lewes? After many awkward silences and strange noises in the  background, Peter said that he probably would be free on July 8th, but  needed to check a few details. Could he phone me back in the evening?A  day passed and I hadn't heard a thing from Peter. I phoned him:\"Ah  yes, Mr...er...I'm glad you phoned me because I don't appear to have  your number. Anyway, July 11th should be fine in Storrington. What? July  8th in Teddington? Oh...well I'll have to check my  diary...hmm...hmm...yes, that should be fine too.\"My heart sank.To  move couldn't have been simpler: 30 boxes, three chairs and one fridge,  but when Peter - a portly, ruddy-faced man in his late 50s - arrived an  hour late (only a minute before my mother ceased to be the legal owner  of her house), he seemed overwhelmed by the task ahead of him. \"You  said there were 20 boxes,\" he complained. I patiently pointed out that  they were very small boxes and would have filled 20 normal ones, but he  was determined to feel hard done by, pointedly refering to the  refrigerator as the \"fridge-freezer\", as if we'd deceived him.My mother turned to me and in a whisper that you could hear 50 yards away, said \"He's a drinker.\" Suddenly  a van door opened and a young man walked up the garden path. \"This is  my er...son,\" explained Peter. The young man said nothing, but slowly  started to rearrange the boxes as if he was playing Tetris. This was  going to take all day.I went up to my bedroom for the  last time. To my surprise, my life there flashed before my eyes in a  slightly crass, cinematic manner. All that was missing was a soundtrack -  maybe the oboe and harp version of the Crossroads theme tune that they  used to play during particularly sad moments.I thought  of the time I first discovered Radio Four, when I was eight, and  listened in the dark to Mrs Rochester's terrifying wails. I also  remembered the patterned wallpaper that seemed to come alive and dance  in the semi-dark; recording songs from the Top 20 on Sunday evenings;  practising scales on my new piano, recovering from my first hangover;  listening to late night phone-ins on LBC; being cold; the sound of  trains trundling past; reading Enid Blyton by torchlight; and, when I  was two, being carried around the house by Dad to show me that there  were no strangers hiding.I closed the door and said goodbye.I  went downstairs and told Peter that we were going to leave. We would  wait for them in Lewes. All Peter had to do was leave the door on the  latch and shut it behind him when he left. What could possibly go wrong?Mum  and I got in the car and as I turned the key in the ignition, I  realised that this was it. We could never go back. I had expected this to be an emotional moment for my mother, but she was too preoccupied with  an anecdote about Auntie Betty to even notice. I interupted Mum and said  that we should say goodbye to the house. She looked back briefly and  said \"The funny thing is, I don't feel anything. I just want to get to  the new place.\"When I had arrived, all that Mum was  concerned about was being able to make a cup of tea for the removal men.  It took quite a lot of persuading before she agreed to let me pack the  kettle and tea bags. Later, as we joined the M25, she said \"Well, I'm  glad I didn't make him a cup of tea now. He's absolutely useless. I  wouldn't be surprised if he locks himself out of the house.\" After  40 miles, the hazy outline of the South Downs appeared in the distance.  It had been raining heavily for most of the journey and I worried about  my mother's chairs getting wet. But as we drew closer to Lewes, the  clouds broke and the sun appeared. \"This is a good sign,\" my mother  said.As we entered the hall of the flats, I felt like a  nervous parent taking their child to university or boarding school. How  would my mother get on? Would she make friends? Would she wish that  she'd stayed in Teddington? These questions had haunted me for the last  few months.Walking towards the lift, we heard a  loud voice behind us: \"Now, who's this trying to sneak past me without  saying hello?\" It was the house manager. We barely knew her, but she  threw her arms around my mother as if she was a long-lost relative. It  was a good start, but I was still anxious to see my mother's reaction to  the flat.I opened the door and let my mother go in  first: \"Ooh, what a lovely carpet...cor, you've been busy...oh I like  this...and you can see the hills...and the curtains aren't too bad...I  might keep them...this is lovely, really lovely.\" As  we stood by the window, looking at the sheep grazing on the Downs, my  phone rang:  \"Hello, this is Peter...no, we're still in Teddington. The  thing is, I did as you suggested and took the door off the latch and  shut it behind me, but then I remembered that I'd left my briefcase in  the kitchen and I really need it.What should I do?\"Several responses sprang to mind. Peter  and son eventually arrived three hours late. I decided to help them  rather than waste another two hours and by 6.00, it was all over. At the  end Peter was charm itself, wishing my mother a happy time in Lewes,  recommending local places for a good lunch. We said goodbye and I  comforted myself with the knowledge that I would never require Peter's  services again.One week on, I have been amazed by the  ease with which my mother has adapted to her new circumstances. She  seems genuinely happy in a way that I never dared to imagine was  possible and I hope that without the burden of trying to manage a cold,  damp house in a street with no shops, my mother still has at least  another decade ahead of her.The last few weeks have  been exhausting, but they have also been a welcome distraction from the  main thing that is going on in my life at the moment. Three weeks ago,  my oldest son was diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder (it's complicated, so I'll avoid labels for the moment).On the  one hand, this news is heartbreaking, but on the other it comes as a  relief after five very difficult years that culminated in us having to  take our son out of school. We now know why he has found ordinary life  so difficult and, more importantly, we will now be able to get him the  help he needs.It's a great pity that some of the psychologists at CAMHS  didn't recognise my son's condition earlier, as he could have been  spared a lot of pain and distress. Instead, we were accused of trying to  'medicalise' our son and the spotlight was turned on our parenting  skills. If we had seen a psychiatrist (as opposed to a psychologist) at  the beginning, our lives might have followed a very different course.I  have avoided writing about this subject for a long time because I'm  aware that the appeal of this blog, for many, is the things I come  across in my job: the strange book covers, old photographs and Derek's  diaries. But since my son's diagnosis, I have found it increasingly  difficult to write the usual, mildly amusing blog posts whilst my life  is undergoing what feels like a huge, techtonic shift.I  apologise for the self-indulgent nature of this post, but it has been  cathartic. I will return to the Victorian photos, politically incorrect  book covers and strange ephemera soon, but for the moment, this is what I  needed to write."},
{"title": "Moving", "date": "Wednesday, July 06, 2011", "text": "Most of us have items of clothing that we only wear indoors. I have an Andrew Marr t-shirt which always cheers me up, but I wouldn't wear it in public. I'm always suspicious of people who sport attention-seeking 'comedy' t-shirts.I also have old Waterstone's t-shirts that I use for doing the decorating. One of them is a very unflattering bright red XL top that says \"Can I help you find the perfect present?\". We had to wear them one Christmas - the idea was that they would make the staff easy to identify and seem more approachable.I wasn't convinced. When I go into shops, I identify staff as the people standing behind the till or the ones who aren't wearing coats.And since when did retail companies have the right to regard their staff as advertising space?The t-shirts were very annoying. When I popped out to buy sandwiches at M&S, I'd forget I had the t-shirt on and wonder why strangers kept accosting me with  questions about books.Yesterday, I had to paint a flat and found an old t-shirt that said \"Ask me about the Waterstone's card\". After putting on the first coat of emulsion, I drove home and popped into the corner shop to buy some wine. Raj, the owner, looked at my chest and said \"Just back from work then?\"Outside the shop, a neighbour looked me up and down and said \"You're early today\". I suddenly realised that, as far as my neighbours were concerned, I still work at Waterstone's. Perhaps I should talk to people more.I had been decorating the flat for my mother. On Friday, she will leave the Teddington house that she has lived in for 48 years and move into a block of sheltered accommodation flats for the elderly, less than a mile from where I live. It will be a huge wrench, I know, but at 81 my mother is finding living alone in a three-bedroom house increasingly hard.I've been trying to persuade her to sell the house for years. Aside from the fact that it has no central heating and needs a huge amount of work done, my mother's house is also too far from the shops or local doctor, so every outing requires a bus journey. Until recently this wasn't a problem, but a near-brush with death last October made my mother realise how vulnerable she is.On Sunday I went to say goodbye to the house that I called home for more than half of my life.It is part of a long road of Victorian, semi-detached redbrick houses, in a sleepy, dull London suburb that is now incredibly popular with house buyers. Teddington may not be very exciting, but the combination of the River Thames, a wealth of parks and some good transport links to central London have made it desirable for those people who find other parts of the metropolis a little too 'urban'.In spite of the popularity of Teddington, I thought that my mother would struggle to sell the house, as in 1981 my parents decided to rip out the period sash windows and pebbledash the walls (I think I once pompously accused them of \"architectural vandalism\"). To my surprise, she found a buyer within 10 days. If ever anyone needed proof that selling houses was all about location, here was a prime example.My mother has left her electric fire for the new owners, as she won't need it in her flat. I had to bite my tongue. I know that the new owners will completely gut the house, extend it and add period touches that were probably never there in the first place. They certainly won't want a naff electric fire.Somehow I don't think they'll want this carpet either:My parents bought it in 1963. The carpet is still in good condition after nearly half a century. Apparently the firm that made it went into receivership, as their products were too well made and retailers didn't want to sell carpets that never wore out. The top left-hand corner used to be covered by a rug.During my final visit I decided to take photos of mundane objects, like the carpet, that hadn't changed since I was a child.  The items included a barometer that never worked, some candlelabra light fittings, two 1970s lampshades and this clock, which chimes every quarter of an hour:When I was sent away to a sanitorium as a child, I was only allowed to see my parents once a month, so telephone calls were very important. I remember the almost unbearable feeling of homesickness that swept over me when I heard this clock chime in the background.(Later, I became less fond of the clock. When I brought girlfriends home after the pubs had closed, I realised what a passion killer the Westminster chimes were).After taking the photos, we had our last lunch in the house: fillet steak with new potatoes and peas. As a special concession to my middle-class sensibilities, my mother didn't call it dinner and only boiled the peas for three minutes instead of the usual ten. Otherwise, everything was the same as it had always been: the table, the chairs and the cutlery, which had been bought with petrol-station coupons some time in the 1970s.In two days time it would all be gone.There was one thing left to do. My mother picked up her stick and put her other arm in mine. Together, we slowly walked to the local cemetery where my father is buried. \"I don't think he's really here\" my mother said, meaning \"This might be the last time I visit my husband's grave\".We stood in front of the grave and I suppose it should have been a very emotional moment, but in the distance someone was holding an outdoor event and all we could hear was a man delivering a very bad performance of David Bowie's 'Rebel Rebel'.I looked at the words on the gravestone: \"He was a good man and did good things\" - inspired by the final sentence of 'The Woodlanders'. I hope that Dad would have approved.I have finished painting the flat, but tomorrow is going to be a day of flatpack hell, where I will have to work out whether Part A is the short screw or the slightly longer one, followed by the realisation that Part C is in fact Part E. I'm dreading it.But hopefully, when my mother walks through the door on Friday afternoon and sees a warm, welcoming, comfortable home, she will feel relief rather than regret."},

{"title": "How I Would Save Waterstone's*", "date": "Wednesday, June 29, 2011", "text": "Last  week the shareholders of HMV reached an almost unanimous decision  to  approve the sale of its Waterstone’s bookshop chain to the Russian   billionaire Alexander Mamut. Today, the business officially changed hands and bookseller James Daunt took over as MD.This is great news for everyone in the   publishing industry, not to mention readers who value specialist   booksellers with large stockholdings.Alexander MamutAlso,  on a  personal note, as it is almost five years to the day since the  bookshop chain I  worked for was bought by HMV, it has been hard not to  to feel a certain  schadenfreude  at the demise of those people who thought that bookselling  was no  different from any other area of retail. I hope that there will  be no  need for the word ‘product’ in James Daunt’s Waterstone’s.But   before we put out the flags, a word of caution. HMV may have  mismanaged Waterstone's for over a decade, but can a change ot ownership  make that much of a difference in a market that appears to be  undergoing an irreversible transformation?However good  Alexander Mamut and James Daunt are, they still might fail.Before we look at the uphill struggle that faces James Daunt, lets focus on the positives:In spite of Amazon and the supermarkets, Waterstone’s      is still a profitable businessIn      2010, its market share was just under 30% of total book salesIt      frequently achieves high scores in customer satisfaction surveysIt      is the only large specialist bookshop chain in BritainPublishers want Waterstone's to surviveIndeed,  when you a visit a branch in December and see the queues, it's hard to  understand how the chain almost ended up in the hands of an asset  stripper.But the reality is that Waterstone's is dying, albeit  very slowly. The sales have been slowly shrinking for over five years  and many shops are now making a loss, including the 'flagship'  Piccadilly store. Several years of negative growth have produced an  entrenched mentality in the senior management and rather than trying to  increase sales (or 'grow' sales, as they now say), the emphasis is on  reducing costs: the beginning of the end.**The main management failures of Waterstone's are as follows:They  failed to establish an strong internet presence in the mid-90s and  after a half-hearted attempt, let Amazon fulfill its online orders until  2006 - a move that rivals Decca's decision not to sign the BeatlesThey became obsessed with wooing the mass market at the expense of their traditional market of 'heavy book buyers'They  recruited too many middle managers from other areas of retail, who knew  nothing about books and came from businesses that valued compliance and  uniformity over creativity and passion, resulting in a chain of bland,  unexciting bookshopsThe whole business was dominated by a  counter-intuitive stock control system that looked and felt like a  second rate MS-DOS program from 1989They reacted to changes in the book trade, rather than anticipating themIn short, there are a lot of things wrong with Waterstone's and even if James Daunt can fix some of them, will anyone notice?One  of the most salutary (I know this word has been out of fashion since  the 1870s, but I like it) lessons I learned in the book trade was when  Waterstone's took over Ottakar's, rebranding every shop in the chain.  For me, it was a cataclysmic event. For my customers, it was just  another day. Very few of them even noticed the huge new black sign over  the door.Getting the book buying public excited about Waterstone's again will be a huge challenge.To make things worse, the high street is going into meltdown.  Long established brands like Mothercare, Habitat, Thorntons and TJ  Hughes are either going into administration or slashing the number of  stores, as customers increasingly migrate to the internet.It's not a  good time to work in high street retailing.In an ideal  world, James Daunt would have a few months to get his head around the business before  coming up with a plan to save the chain. Unfortunately, time is a luxury  James Daunt doesn't have. The crucial Christmas promotions will have to  be signed off almost immediately.On  the one hand I don't envy James Daunt, but on the other, this is a  fantastic opportunity. The death of Waterstone's needn't be inevitable.  Other chains have suprised their detractors by reversing their fortunes  and it's possible that James Daunt and Alexander Mamut may go down in  posterity as the men who saved Britain's last bookshop chain.But how?If I was sitting in James Daunt's chair next Monday, these would be my priorities:1. Increase the stockholding.There  was a time when you could go into most branches of Waterstone's and  expect to find all of the backlist of authors like Ian McEwan or William  Boyd. Not any more. Without a decent range, Waterstone's is finished.  Of course, keeping a large range of slow-moving backlist titles is expensive, but if publishers are  really serious about supporting Waterstone's, they should provide the  stock under more favourable terms. Surely it's in the publishers'  interest to have their books in shops rather than in a warehouse?If customers can once again feel confident that they can find the book they want today (at a competitive price), they'll be less likely to automatically default to  Amazon.2. End the blandness.Whether you're looking at  the homepage of www.waterstones.com or gazing at a shop window, the  overall impression is one of blandness. Dull, safe posters with insipid,  dumbed-down bylines and predictable 3 for 2 promotions that have the  same titles in month after month - that's the modern Waterstone's. In  Ottakar's, shops competed with each other to come up with the quirkiest,  most eye-catching windows. In Waterstone's, compliance has been valued  over creativity.Waterstone's branches need to make their shops  as exciting as the books: eccentric, unpredictable, magical places,  buzzing with energy, otherwise what's the point of going there?As  for the website, it should be a bibliophile's paradise, with videos of  author interviews, YouTube clips of signing sessions and a vast archive  of author information. At Ottakar's I was on the editorial committee of  an award-winning fiction microsite and we produced hundreds of author  biographies. I presume that Waterstone's now own that data, so why isn't  it being used on their website?3. Embrace the e-book.As  with the internet, Waterstone's made a half-hearted attempt at  competing with Amazon and squandered a vital opportunity to get on the  digital bandwagon. The game isn't over yet. Thousands of backlist titles  have yet to be digitised and if Waterstone's can come up with a  genuinely competitive alternative to the Kindle, they may be able to stop their  shops becoming showrooms for Amazon.4. Put staff morale at the top of the agenda.The  working culture in Waterstone's has been awful. An obsession with compliance  has produced a climate of fear, where disciplinary action is routinely  used as a motivational tool. When shops are earmarked for closure, staff  often find out from the trade press before they receive any  communication from the senior management.The key to Waterstone's  recovery is the enthusiasm and passion of its booksellers. But it  will be hard to improve staff morale if the store managers are stuck in  the back office for most of the day, completing one spreadsheet and after  another. The excessive bureacracy should be trimmed down so that managers can spend more time selling books.Staff morale in James Daunt's own chain is good, by all accounts. I hope that he  can persuade some of the more abrasive characters in Waterstone's middle management  to change their approach.5. Give power back to the shops.When  I worked on a few projects for Ottakar's head office, I had access to  the company's sales data and used to love analysing the sales  performance of particular titles in different shops. Why did book X  sell 57 copies in one shop, but only 4 in another, when both stores had  a similar turnover? Sometimes it was because one shop had sold out, but  more often than not it was because the local market was very different.There  has been a lot of talk in Waterstone's about responding to the local  market, but when I walk in the front door, all I see is a bland,  one-size-fits all approach. Each shop should have a unique offering that  reflects the passion and knowledge of its staff, along with a strong awareness of the local customers.6. Ditch the new Waterstone's logo:Alright,  number six isn't essential (I know some people even prefer the new drooping breasts logo to the traditional, angular W). The main thing is shops with more books,  and a range and pricing that reflects the local market.I could  go on. I haven't even touched on the thorny issue of closing  unprofitable shops, fixing or scrapping the central distribution hub,  introducing a half-decent EPOS system or paying people more money. But  that's enough to be going on with.You may completely disagree with me (indeed I hope some people do, as I  like a good debate). Perhaps Waterstone's would be even worse off today  if it hadn't been run on strict retail lines. I don't know. All I can  say is that as an Amazon customer, the main thing that would get me back  into Waterstone's is a quirky, exciting range. However good Amazon is,  you can't beat real browsing.I wish Alexander Mamut and James  Daunt the best of luck (and God knows, they'll need it). If they can  bring Waterstone's back from the brink of extinction, to the point where  it is a viable business with a future, both readers and publishers will  owe them a huge debt.**** The title should really be 'How I Would Go About Saving Waterstone's' (I wouldn't be arrogant enough to assume that I have the answers), but I went for the punchier option.** Since writing this post, it has been announced that during its year under Dominic Myers, Waterstone's increased its profit by £6.7 million. This is a great achievement, but doesn't alter the fact that unless the business reverses the decline in sales (last year's were nearly 4% down on the previous year), its days are numbered. Also, let's not forget that during Myers tenure, Waterstone's sales received a temporary boost from the demise of Borders.*** Two years on, the chain appears to be trying to replicate the success of Daunt's by turning Waterstones into a collection of mini-chains, or 'clusters'. Unprofitable stores are being closed the moment their leases expire, while some of the more successful shops have undergone refits. There has been a cull of middle and senior managers. As for ebooks, after looking at all the alternatives, James Daunt reluctantly decided to embrace the Kindle rather than waste time and money on a white elephant.I agree with most of Daunt's decisions, but I'm not convinced by his new buying structure. I would have given the shops complete autonomy, but perhaps James Daunt felt that after the HMV years, there weren't enough real booksellers around to take that risk. The chain is now in a race against time to contract to a sustainable level at a rate that keeps pace with the declining year on year sales. I suspect that they are being outpaced by the migration of sales to Amazon's Kindle offer.****Three years on, it looks as if Daunt has done it. Ebook sales have levelled out and Waterstones looks set to break even for the first time in years. The medicine has been bitter, for some at least, with many redundancies and the loss of some very talented people, but it was an ineluctable fact that the costs of the business were too high. I remained sceptical about Waterstones until I saw its new branch in Lewes, which is one of the best bookshops I've ever seen."},
{"title": "The Enigma Variations", "date": "Saturday, June 25, 2011", "text": "I found this photo at work yesterday and almost threw it away, but there was something intriguing about the scene. Who was the mysterious figure in the centre who had drawn such a large crowd?The image was of a fairly poor quality, but I hoped that a high resolution scan might resolve the enigma.I scanned the image at 1200 dpi, which is more than adequate for most old photographs, and let Photoshop work its magic, enlarging different sections.Here are the results:This is the full photo after the colour balance and contrast have been improved (apologies to all fans of sepia). There is a greater clarity, but the figure in the centre remains tantalisingly elusive.Now everything becomes much clearer, apart from the blurred figures of the men at the front. Is that who I think it is?A further zoom has expanded the crest above the woman's head to a resolution where some of the writing is legible.It is, of course, the Royal Coat of Arms, with its motto Dieu Et Mon Droit. I can only assume that it is Queen Victoria who has drawn such a large crowd on a rainy day.I have no idea where or when this picture was taken. Queen Victoria is wearing black and given that she went into a prolonged period of mourning after Prince Albert's death, this must be the late 1860s, at the very earliest.Perhaps someone who knows about fashion will be able to determine which decade this photograph was taken in. I would certainly like to know about the significance of these hats:Scanned at 1200 dpi, the enlarged sections look like a monochrome, pointilist crowdscape by Seurat. Most of the people have their backs turned to us and the few faces we can see are blank and expressionless.All apart from one - the woman on Queen Victoria's right. She appears to be looking down, in deference to the Queen.Of course I may be completely on the wrong track. Someone might recognise the enigmatic figure as 'Big Bertha' McMahon, the famous Victorian female heavyweight wrestler, or Dame Cynthia Partington-Ffoulkes, whose Temperance League speeches terrified pub landlords from Portsmouth to Perth.It could even be an author signing session, perhaps by Mrs Henry Wood, if they did things like that in the nineteenth century.However, I'm fairly confident that I've discovered a photograph of Queen Victoria.If anyone has any observations or insights about the time and the place, I'd be very grateful. I would love to know more about this mysterious image."},
{"title": "The Mouse That Roared", "date": "Wednesday, June 22, 2011", "text": "I have to admit that my knowledge of the British Raj in India is probably limited to a single viewing of Richard Attenborough's 'Ghandi' and the first episode of the television series 'The Jewel in the Crown' (I can't remember why I didn't watch the whole series).Also, last year, I listened to a radio programme about the Indian Mutiny.This seriously compromises my ability to add pithy, relevant comments to the following photographs, which come from an album featuring a group of British soldiers in India during the years 1917-19. I tried to gen-up on Wikipedia, but it had one of the longest entries I've ever come across.So here are the photos, minus any pertinent, erudite observations. I may even have to resort to making fun of people's pith helmets and absurd moustaches:How did a relatively small army of overgrown boy scouts, from a damp little island in northern Europe, manage to successfully govern a vast, densely populated subcontinent in Asia? Several modern commentators have suggested that when we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, we could have done with learning a few lessons in statecraft from the Raj.He looks like a serious sort of chap, but the short trousers don't really convey the right sense of gravitas. It must have been unbearably hot and humid for the British Army to go these lengths (or lack of).\"See that beautiful bird up there? Ten bob says I can bring it down within two shots...\"\"Bingo! I'll get the kitchen wallahs to serve it for dinner.\"\"Sir, we have run out of fuel in the kitchens. We will call the Coal Wallah...\"One of the greatest (and least controversial) legacies of British rule in India was the rail network.Rather disturbingly, it looks as if the small boy has some sort of chain around its neckA rare shot of 'our boys' in long trousersThese were a highly-disciplined body of men, ready to quash any insurrection at a moment's notice, even in their underwearBut beyond their proud military bearing, these soldiers had a more sensitive sideYou can insert your own caption hereSadly, although the album has details of dates and locations, there are no names, otherwise I'd try and locate a living relative of these men (hopefully not the person who threw it out a few weeks ago). Since I launched my project at work, I've only had one success story - this handwritten novel was reunited with the author's relatives, to their delight.But this album will now join the others, gathering dust in a corner of my office. I know I'll never throw it away."},
{"title": "French Leave", "date": "Monday, June 20, 2011", "text": "I have just returned from a very wet week in Normandy, during which I  was assaulted by goats and mocked by the French for my appalling grasp  of their language. In both cases it was my own fault. I went into each  situation with a lot of goodwill, but a lamentable absence of foresight.On  the plus side, it was a learning curve. I will never again make the  mistake of walking into the middle of a herd of goats with an open bag  of food, and as far as speaking French goes, I must try harder.I had made the mistake of thinking that my recent Livemocha  French course would be enough to get me through everday situations.  Every time I completed an online exercise, an encouraging email would  arrive within seconds saying \"Great job!\"In  hindsight, the positive feedback probably gave me a slightly inflated  view of my abilities. When, on the first day, I confidently asked a  supermarket cashier for a plastic bag, I was completely foxed by her  reply: \"Souhaitezvousuneboîtepourlesbouteillesdevin?\"As the week went on, I became increasingly adept at saying \"Je ne comprends pas\". I  clearly need to learn some more French, but at times I'm tempted to go  back to the tried and trusted method of smiling, shouting and pointing.But  it wasn't all humiliation and goats; there were magical moments too.  One day I went for a drive with my mother-in-law and we ended up in a  beautiful forest, near the town of Saint-Sever-Calvados:After several miles of driving through dense woodland along empty roads, we saw a sign pointed to 'L'Hermitage'.  It sounded intriguing, so I turned off and followed a rough track until  we reached a group of large, granite stone buildings. A sign announced  that were at a convent, which was strictly privée, but visitors were welcome to visit the chapel.I  parked the car and we got out. It was completely silent, apart from  sound of birdsong and the wind roaring through the branches of the  trees. A perfect place for the contemplative life.As we walked  down a dark, wooded lane to the chapel, an elderly Frenchman seemed to  appear from nowhere and started talking to us. By now I was used to  saying \"Je ne comprends pas\" and expected a characteritic shrug of resignation, but instead we received a reply in perfect, slightly aristocratic English.When we complimented the man on his English, he explained that he'd taught the subject in Caen for over 20 years:\"I  still live in Caen, but every year I come here for a retreat for a few  days, to enjoy the silence. Would you like me to show you around the  chapel?\" The chapel was beautiful, with an austerity that reminded me of a 6th century church that I'd visited last year. It belonged to this order of nuns  and although a sign asked vistors not to disturb the residents, I was a  little confused to learn that they had a gift shop that sold greetings  cards, books and CDs.After the well-spoken stranger had finished  giving a tour of the chapel, he invited us into the convent for a cup  of tea. He confessed that as much as he loved the contemplative life, he  was quite relieved when strangers turned up.We were led to a  simply-furnished room with bare stone walls and served tea and brioche,  accompanied by some gorgeous jam that had been made by the nuns.After  exchanging a few pleasantries, we asked the man about his life. He was  called Father Yves and belonged to a religious order called the Salesians, who are known for their work in educating underprivilged children. He had been associated with the order since he was a child.Born  in Paris, Yves' father died shortly before the War and his mother,  unable to cope with raising four children on her own, sent him to an  orphange in Normandy. It sounded like the beginning of a tragic story,  but Father Yves was quick to dismiss any suggestions that he'd had a  tough childhood:\"No, no! It was a very good orphanage. I had a much better life being there than I would have done otherwise.\"We  went on to talk about the persecution of the Catholic church after the  Revolution and I mentioned how much French history I'd learned from  reading novels. My mother-in-law agreed, saying how much she loved Zola.  There was a slightly awkward silence (somehow I don't think that Father  Yves was a Zola fan) before he asked if we'd read Stevenson's 'Travels  With a Donkey'. When we shook our heads, he seemed shocked:\"It is a wonderful book and I have done the same journey myself three times. But without the donkey.\"Later,  as we walked back to the car, my mother-in-law and I agreed that it had  been worth coming to Normandy just to meet Father Yves. Anything else  was a bonus.Sadly, the rest of the week was spent dodging  showery squalls and our suntan lotions and beachwear never saw the light  of day. However, in between downpours we did manage to go on a few  excursions.Here are a few of my favourite moments:1. A trip to Dinan:I  wanted to visit Brittany and the town of Dinan, with its largely  unspoilt medieval centre, is well worth a visit. However, I wish that  the owners of the house below hadn't filled their hanging baskets with  plastic flowers. Très vulgaire!2. Encounters with lemurs:During  a brief spell of sunshine, we visited a superb zoo that had recreated a  Madagascan forest environment - minus any logging companies - where  lemurs could wander freely. Most of the time, they seemed to be content  to laze on the grass and lick their genitals, but occasionally they  liked to investigate the visitors and seemed happy to pose for  photographs.3. Sandstone saintAt  a church in Granville, this sandstone figure of a saint has become so  weathered that it now looks like an abstract contemporary sculpture. I'm  not sure if this picture will appeal to anyone else, but I liked it.4. A typically French solution to a rattling window shutter:5. Frog Prison:By sheer coincidence our next door neighbour was also in Normandy last  week, staying at her parents' house, so we drove over to have lunch with  her. Although we had a lovely time, it was a small house and my sons  soon started to get restless, so our neighbour asked them if they'd like  to see something unusual.She led the boys out into the small backyard, turned a hose tap on and  started firing a jet of water at a small drain, that was covered with a  metal grill.Suddenly, a frog appeared, holding onto the bars like a prisoner looking through a cell window:Apparently  the frog lives in the drain. How he got there and the question of  whether he has a secret exit or not is unknown, but he clearly has  enough to eat. Our neighbour said that he'd been there for years, but I  didn't think frogs lived that long. Is he the same frog, trapped in  solitary confinement for years, or one of a family of subterranean  amphibians?6. French supermarkets:French  supermarkets are wonderful. Anywhere where you can buy a decent bottle  of wine for £3 and choose from a huge selection of cheeses can't be bad,  but I was particularly interested in the books. For all their supposed  cultural chauvinism, the French had a far wider selection of Anglophone  authors in translation than I expected.I was particularly intrigued to find a number of English-sounding names  that I'd never heard of. Were these authors who'd found more success  abroad than they had in their own countries, or were they American  authors who'd never been published in Britain?When I worked at Waterstone's in Richmond, I was often asked by German customers for novels by Noah Gordon.  The first time I was asked for a copy of Gordon's novel 'The  Physician', I confessed that I'd never heard of him. The German customer  exploded: \"But he is a bestselling English author in Germany! You MUST have his books!\" After a quick check on the microfiche, I explained to the woman that  there were no Noah Gordon novels in print in Britain and asked if he  was, by any chance, American? \"Yes, he is American, but if he is a bestseller in America and Germany, why not Britain?\" It was a question I couldn't answer. For whatever reason, some American  authors fail to take off in Britain and vice versa - I'm told that Lisa  Scottoline is a perefctly good crime writer, but in spite of several  marketing campaigns and jacket redesigns, her novels have never become  popular on this side of the Atlantic. A similar attempt was made with  Noah Gordon. Perhaps he's better in translation.Browsing through the large selection of French novels (a far wider  selection than any British supermarket would stock), I was frustrated to  see so many intriguing-looking titles that would probably never be  translated into English.That, of course, is another reason for learning French. I may never  become a fluent speaker and will continue to be baffled by a language  that sounds like a non-stop succession of vowels and soft consonants,  but if I could read books in French, that alone would make it  worthwhile."},
{"title": "More Victorians", "date": "Friday, June 10, 2011", "text": "Yesterday another Victorian photograph album appeared on my desk at  work, rescued by someone in the warehouse. Sadly, it wasn't as  fascinating as this album, which I found last year, but there were a few portraits which I thought were worth sharing:I'm not quite sure why this photograph of a Spike Milligan lookalike and his wife was taken at such a jaunty angle.The boy's face is slightly blurred because he didn't remain still, but the dog was clearly an experienced sitter.A wonderful, strong faceThe husband in this couple from Oban looks like a formidable characterThe  one intriguing thing about this album is the variety of locations that  these photographs were taken in: Cardiff, London, Oban, Birmingham,  Aberdeen and Leamington Spa - if this is a family album, they were  clearly a product of the huge migration that took place during the early  Victorian age, when people left their largely rural homes in search of  work.When he retired, my father traced our family tree and got  back as far as the 1740s. The death certificates showed that when they  lived in the rural Kentish village that had been their home for  generations, my ancestors lived to a ripe old age. Then one of them  moved to London and became a cab driver.Both he and his son died in their early 50s."},
{"title": "The Problem of Evil", "date": "Wednesday, June 08, 2011", "text": "One of the strangest publications I've come across recently is a 1939 pamphlet called 'Tom, Dick and Harry', produced by the Mansfield House University Settlement - not a name I was familiar with.A quick search a Google produced this result:\"The Mansfield House University     Settlement was founded in 1889 and was intended to give students of Mansfield College     Oxford first hand experience of living and working with working-class people. The     Settlement wanted to bring ‘culture’ to the people of the East End, and to     provide people with opportunities for leisure, recreation and self-improvement. (The idea     was partly to encourage people to take up respectable pursuits, rather than spend all     their time and money in the public house.)\"So far so good: a group of well-intentioned Oxford undergraduates helping the poor.As for the pamphlet, its main purpose seemed to be to raise money for the boys clubs that the Settlement had established in the East End. Once again, a laudible cause.But when I saw the subtitle 'A Calendar of Good and Evil', my alarm bells started to ring. For example, the young man below may be a bit of a ruffian, but is evil really the right word?Apparently this is what he should be doing:Quite right too. A bracing 12-mile ride to find the nearest stretch of countryside will do this young man a world of good. Away from the temptations of the city, he will discover new pleasures: medieval churches, brass rubbing, butterfly collecting and bird spotting.The whole pamphlet consists of pairs of contrasting photographs: one showing a youth being 'good' at a boys' club; the other depicting 'evil' in the streets:These two tearaways are behaving like savages, not subjects of His Majesty King George VI. The Marquess of Queensbury would be turning in his grave.Luckily, the Boys' Club provides Cockney lads with a more constructive outlet for their innate cunning and pent-up aggression:\"This is good, and I say, isn't that WH Auden in the background? Apparently nobody turned up to the poetry class. Philistines!\"In addition to promoting physical health, the Mansfield House Settlement was also concerned about the mental and spiritual well-being of their boys - a young man should not be filling his head with lurid tales of murder and adultery (at least he's reading a newspaper!):Instead, he should be in the library, brushing up his Latin and memorising Ozymandias for the Christmas concert:But a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. Supposing our lads become susceptible to the lure of political extremism:\"We have happily no need in this country to beat the big drum; nor to regiment youth into a hectic nationalism; the right spirit is there and only needs to be fostered to grow unconsciously and naturally.\"Given that the year is 1939 and this is the East End of London, where Blackshirts and Communists had fought fierce battles in the streets, the words of this pamphlet are rather pointed.As for the 'right spirit' that needs to be fostered, this photo is given as an illustration:Here, our young wastrels are enjoying a four-part arrangement of 'Linden Lea', with the inspiring figure of Lord Nelson in the background. No nationalism here - that's too foreign.But these boys cannot exist purely on a diet of Shelley, Vaughan Williams and vigorous exercise. During the interludes between world wars, they need to be gainfully employed:The alternative, as 'Tom, Dick and Harry' subtly points out, is this:\"Not so fast now, you young good-for-nothing!\"But if one of the members of the Boys' Club does revert to his dissolute ways of old, he can be certain that his former partners in crime will hunt him down like a dog, until he is bought to justice:I wonder what happened to the boys' clubs fundraising drive? Was it quickly eclipsed by the advent of war, or did the Mansfield House University Settlement come into its own during the Blitz?  It has been difficult to find out, although this website gives a brief history of the charity up to the year 2000.From a modern perspective, the 'Tom, Dick and Harry' pamphlet seems absurd. We shy away from using the word evil these days and I think that there are times when we shouldn't be afraid to use it, but if we apply it to feckless teenage boys, then what word do we have left for people like Ratko Mladic?As for the idea of privileged university graduates trying to bring 'culture' to the East End, it might seem ridiculous - who would dare to do that today? But if the alternative is doing nothing, condemning people to live their whole lives without having a choice, I'd rather have some naive, well-intentioned undergraduate patronise me with high art and adult education classes.My grandfather was a Cockney and fought in the First World War. He never had a chance to learn a trade before the War and when he returned, opprtunities were limited. He spent his entire working life in a succession of badly paid jobs as an 'unskilled labourer'.My father seemed destined to follow the same path, leaving school at the age of 14 to work in a factory. But things had changed. A spell of National Service in the RAF at the end of the Second World War seemed to open new horizons and my father wasn't willing to meekly return to his old life. Instead, he went to night school and prepared for the Civil Service Entrance Exam which, in many ways, was an IQ test. He passed.My father never became truly middle class, but he was a world away from his father's life, with its limited choices and low expectations.By the time I was an 'A' Level student, in the 1980s, it felt as if class and background were completely irrelevant. But at university I learned how wrong I was.The people at the Mansfield House University Settlement knew that lives were limited by social background and we should salute them for their efforts, even if their attempts at fundraising were a little overzealous!"},

According to the  'UK National Ecosystem Assessment', nature is worth £50 billion and the health benefit of living close to a green landscape is £300 per person per year.Of  course, that's putting it very crudely. This report is a complex survey  that involved hundreds of scientists, but newspapers need headlines and  'Nature worth £50billion to Britain's economy' has to compete with the latest update on Ryan Giggs' love life.I thought about this report yesterday, when I took my sons to the Lewes Railway Land  project - a nature reserve created out of waste ground that used to be  railway sidings. Twenty years ago, there was talk of turning the land  into a retail park, with space for several hundred cars. In Crawley they would have had the JVCs out before the ink was dry on the contract, but in Lewes it was a different story.Here's what could have been the 873rd branch of Sainbury's:Hopefully there will be fewer retail parks in the future and more places like this.The other benefit of going to the Railway Land is that it was completely free. My sons spent a couple of hours having far more fun than they would have done manically charging around a softplay centre, bouncing off the walls.As we left I congratulated myself for not spending any money. But then I went and completely blew it by visiting the Lewes farmers' market.That was a big mistake:"},
{"title": "Lost and Found", "date": "Tuesday, May 31, 2011", "text": "I didn't set out to create a theme to this post, but today's book jackets have conveniently fallen into two distinct categories: Schoolboy Mayhem and Ladies in Africa (and I use the word 'ladies' deliberately).First, if you thought that the British public school was the epitome of order and self-discipline, think again:After pausing for a second to straighten his tie, Polson quickly lashes out at the new boy who has committed the double sin of being ginger and failing to leave the bottom button of his waistcoat undone, much to the amusement of a young Kenneth Williams at the far right. It's a jungle out there.(NB - Richard at Grey Area has pointed out that this may actually be an early version of Gilbert and George's Bend It)Things go from bad to worse at Prior's, the 14th best public school in Herefordshire. Here you can see the 17th Viscount Melrose administering a sound thrashing to a ghastly scholarship boy who keeps talking about the poetry and the 'brotherhood of man'.Legend has it that the game of Rugby was born in 1823, when William Webb Ellis \"with fine disregard for the game of football\" picked up the ball and starting running with it. It was the beginning of a noble tradition.The boys at Moorhaven School tried a similar thing in 1872, when Aubrey Gosling picked up a dead monkey and ran from the tuck shop to the cricket pavilion in under two minutes. The 'Monkey Run' quickly became a school tradition, but it never caught on.With this book, there seems to be a slight dissonance between the sci-fi title and the image of a schoolboy being chased across a field. I can only presume that the bull isn't under alien control, so what's going on? Is that a deadly alien weapon they're holding?This book isn't nearly as exciting as it sounds.What interests me is how children's book covers have become far more  'touchy-feely\" in recent years, whilst many of the stories have become darker.This photograph was found in one of the books. At first it looks quite incongruous, but closer scrutiny reveals how pissed off everyone is.The final three jackets all fall into the 'Ladies in Africa' category:Moving to Africa, this cover seem to suggest dark passions ignited by the lure of the Casbah, although the dustjacket blurb clearly states that she falls in love with a man called Julian. I don't think that's a Moroccan name.The rather convoluted dustjacket blurb reads:\"When Pudge Barton went on safari in Kenya with her friend Beryl and Beryl's father, Commissioner Newton, with whom she was staying for the summer holidays, she little knew what lay ahead...\" I've no idea what this novel's about, but I'd like to think that it is a sequel to 'Strange Safari':\"Jilted at the altar, when her fiance Rodney runs off with a 14-year-old Masai girl, Beryl Newton flees to Zanzibar, where she amuses herself by holding drinking competitions with foreign journalists. A life of alcoholism and penury beckons, but Beryl's fortunes suddenly change when her long-lost friend Pudge walks into the bar, accompanied by a woman smoking a pipe.\"I feel as if I'm trawling through a golden age of book jacket design, between the plain, utilitarian covers from before the First World War, to the knowing, postmodern images of our time.I can't imagine anyone laughing at the cover of the 'Da Vinci Code' in 50 years time. But all is not lost. We can still content ourselves with the absurd text."},

{"title": "Crawley (Another Dull Post About Bookselling)", "date": "Thursday, May 26, 2011", "text": "Only two weeks ago I was writing about the fate of Waterstone's - the largest bookshop chain outside the USA.The story of Waterstone's is a sad one. Once, it was the pre-eminent specialist bookseller in Britain, synonymous with range and authority. For a generation who had grown up with a stark choice between a poorly stocked independent bookseller and a branch of W H Smith, Waterstone's was a revelation.Publishers loved Waterstone's too. Suddenly, they could sell all of their difficult backlist and midlist titles to the most obscure corners of Middle England. Sales reps, armed with suitcases full of stock catalogues, descended like vultures, eager to take advantage of the bright, but often clueless, young booksellers, who were usually straight out of university.I was one of them. When John Calder - Samuel Beckett's publisher - arrived unannounced and proceeded to order a vast quantity of backlist titles that we'd never sell, it didn't occur to me to dare to challenge his recommendations.But it wasn't just John Calder's books that clogged up the shelves . The weakness of the original Waterstone's was that we thought that range was everything and stocked a lot of authors whose books no longer sold. Returns were done sporadically and, over the years, the shelves became clogged with dead stock (I once returned to my old branch of Waterstone's, five years after leaving and was dismayed to find stock that I'd ordered still sitting on the shelves).However, when HMV bought the company, they went too far in the opposite direction.One of the great strengths of the old Waterstone's was that if you liked the new Justin Cartwright novel, you could feel fairly confident that there'd be several of his backlist titles on the shelf. But not any more. HMV stripped away everything that was good about Waterstone's until it became the bland retail chain that it is today. Admittedly the competition was much tougher after the collapse of the Net Book Agreement, but, without a decent range, what was the point of Waterstone's?Only a few weeks ago, Waterstone's looked as if it was finished, but  luckily HMV were forced to sell the chain and it now has a whole new  lease of life as a privately owned company.In my last post, I cited Daunt Books as an example of how booksellers can survive and I'm heartened to see that the new owner has appointed James Daunt as Managing Director.But, as several people have commented, although Daunt Books has bucked the trend of declining high-street book sales, isn't that  simply because James Daunt has been astute enough to open shops in the wealthiest parts of London? How will he apply his formula to a national chain with stores in a variety of locations?I have some experience in this area. Eleven years ago I became the manager of a loss-making branch of Ottakar's in Crawley - a 'new town' near Gatwick Airport. The shop wouldn't have been my first choice, but I wanted to buy a house in Lewes and Crawley was the nearest branch of the chain. Also, with a newborn son, I was struggling to manage my frantically busy London store. It was time to downsize.I had mixed feelings about moving to Crawley, particularly the commuting. First, I had to drive for 23 miles along this road:Then, as I reached the outskirts of Crawley, the traffic suddenly slowed down and the remaining part of my journey was spent slowly negotiating my way through roadworks, roundabouts and estates of cheap modern houses. It was particularly grim in the winter.Finally, there was the huge disappointment when I arrived:Crawley was a mistake. Once a small, sleepy place on the way to Brighton, it became identified as a potential 'new town' after the end of the Second World War and by the late 1950s the population had increased fivefold, largely due to an influx of Londoners.At this point, Crawley was regarded as one of the more successful new towns, providing thousands of jobs and affordable homes. Unlike some of its counterparts, Crawley hadn't been ruined by Brutalist architecture and high-rise developments. It was more like an outer London suburb that had been dropped onto a field in Sussex.But Crawley became the victim of its own success and, in the 1960s, permission was given to expand the town to 120,000 - a twelvefold increase on its 1945  population level. By the 1990s, the town's character had been completely eradicated by over-development and cheap, poorly designed housing.Ottakar's were generally very astute at picking new sites for the bookshops, but they got it horribly wrong with Crawley. I was surprised, as a quick walk around the town centre would have confirmed that this wasn't bookshop territory - it was as if the middle classes had been ethnically cleansed.Also, the town centre had seen better days:As if this wasn't enough, there was already a branch of Waterstone's in the town, so what was the point of my shop? What could we offer our customers?It would have been easy to feel despondent. I was managing a shop that was only taking 50% of its projected turnover in a town that didn't need another bookshop. Also, all of the bookselling knowledge I'd acquired in London seemed utterly useless (when Saramago won the Nobel Prize for literature, our branches in London quickly picked up the phone and ordered all of the backlist. In Crawley, I think they thought that Saramago was the manager of West Ham).But, curiously, I felt invigorated by my new branch. Anyone can sell books in London - you just put the books on the table and open the doors. But to make a success of shop like Crawley was a real challenge and I knew that if I was going to make it work, I'd have to unlearn everything I knew.I won't bore you with a blow-by-blow account of what we did, but in less than five years we went from a six-figure loss to being on the verge of breaking into profit. It took a lot of hard work, but the key to our success was that I was trusted to know my local market and allowed to run the shop in the way I saw fit, changing the prices of bestsellers, moving sections that weren't working and experimenting with new ranges.Here are some of the things we did:We always tried to make the shop bright, colourful and welcoming, with simple displays that wouldn't be off-putting to people who didn't normally visit bookshops. Tables generally weren't allowed to have more than six different titles and the selection would always reflect the local,  rather than national, bestsellers.Any empty spaces at the end of sections would have handmade displays, with staff reviews highlighting key titles. In this display (probably made by my very talented assistant manager)  someone has customised some Ottakar's point-of-sale posters.Upstairs we had a small branch of Costa Coffee with large, blank walls. I decided to invite local artists and photographers to display their work in the cafe and on the walls of the staircase. This was a huge success and, in a town without any gallery or arts scene, our shop soon became a hub for local artists and craftspeople.We also had a thriving events programme. A Martin Amis or Ian McEwan signing would have been an embarrassment in Crawley, as our sales of literary fiction were amongst the lowest in the company. But we also enjoyed some of the best sales of children's books and I felt sure that if I could lure Jacqueline Wilson to the shop, it would be a success.In the end, I made an offer that was hard to refuse and the result was the biggest Jacqueline Wilson signing session of all time, which lasted for eight hours. At one point, the queue was nearly a quarter of a mile long. It was a stressful, but exhilarating, day and I loved seeing how the  fans made themselves at home:When authors came to our shop, we always covered up the bookshelves behind the signing table to create a sense of theatre (if that doesn't sound too precious):In addition to the Jacqueline Wilson signing, we held a number of events (including some awful New Age evenings that made me cringe with shame) in an attempt to get people through the door. A successful event got us free advertising in the local paper and word-of-mouth publicity.After five years we almost broke into profit, then the landlords put the rent up. I wasn't very happy.Ultimately we failed, but I'm convinced that we wouldn't have got as far as we did without being given the freedom to experiment and see what worked. Under HMV, I wouldn't have been able to decide what price to sell a book at or choose which titles went on my front table.Which brings me to the point of this post. When James Daunt was announced as the new MD of Waterstone's, some people questioned how he would apply his strategy to shops like Crawley, where people just wanted to buy the new Sharon Osbourne for less than Smith's. However, I was encouraged by his assertion that the future of Waterstone's lay with giving power back to the shops and trusting booksellers to know their local market. If he can trust managers to run their shops, then Waterstone's may have a future.Five years after Waterstone's took over Ottakar's, I feel vindicated. HMV's arrogant assertion that bookselling is no different from any other branch of retail has been proved wrong. In a few weeks time, Waterstone's should be back in the hands of booksellers.I only hope that it isn't too late for the chain to be saved."},

{"title": "A Horizontal Journey", "date": "Saturday, May 21, 2011", "text": "I'm now back in the land of the living. It was only 'flu, but it was a particularly potent version that involved long episodes of sleep, puntuated by some very strange dreams. I won't relate them here because other people's dreams are always so dull.I'm not very good at being ill. I think it's probably because I was quite a sickly child and when, at one point, it looked as if I was going to die, I was sent away to a Victorian sanitorium for a year.Here's the bedroom I used to share with the son of an East End gangster and a boy called Ian, who was described as 'a little backwards':On the whole I got on well with my roommates, although I wasn't terribly happy about Ian's tendency to defecate on the floor.I was at the sanitorium for a year and the combination of sea air, good food and a course of vaccinations did the trick. But although I've enjoyed years of good health and can quite happily walk for 20 miles without feeling tired, the merest hint of illness makes me panic. I'm terrified of going back back to the sanitorium.However, there's also a lot to be said for being forced to lie in bed for six days, particularly if you have a laptop with wireless internet access. Unconstrained by the demands of others, I was able to surf the web for hours, going off on tangential journeys that led to some wonderful discoveries.Here's the best of what I found:1. John KrishIf you've heard of the British documentary filmaker John Krish, then I salute you. There's next to nothing about him on Wikipedia. Fortunately, after decades of neglect, a recent DVD release of four of Krish's short films earned him the 'Best Documentary' award at the 2010 Evening Standard Awards.Here's an extract from John Krish's 1962 documentary 'Our School':John Krish may not be a household name, but he was responsible for what is arguably the most stylish intro sequence in television history:2. Daniel Davies - 'The Isle of Dogs'This is an excellent first novel - one of the best I've read for a long time.If you want to know what 'The Isle of Dogs' is about, the clue's in the title (and the cover). I wouldn't normally be drawn to a novel about 'dogging', but it was recommended on Amazon for people who liked Jonathan Coe's latest novel (which I didn't like), so I started to read the first chapter. From the first page, I knew that I was in good hands (no sniggering at the back).The first thing that anyone should know about 'The Isle of Dogs' is that the dogging is purely incidental. Ultimately, this is a philosophical novel about the pursuit of happiness that manages to engage with the big issues without ever taking itself too seriously. I've no doubt that the sexual content has both repelled and attracted people for the wrong reasons, but I found it touching and comic rather than titillating or embarrassing.Daniel Davies has been compared to Michel Houellebecq and whilst I can see the similarities, he lacks the latter's boorish racism and misogyny. I generally avoid literary criticism on this blog, as so many other people are much better at it, but if you want to know more about 'The Isle of Dogs', I can recommend this interview with the author.3. Fritz Lang - 'M'I know that I'm probably the last person to have heard of this film. Apparently it tops polls as one of the greatest German films of all time, but I knew nothing about it. Made in 1931, this was Lang's first 'talkie' and gives a fascinating glimpse into Germany during the Weimar Republic (only two years later, the artistic climate was very different - 'Dr Mabuse' was banned by Goebbels).'M' is about a man who kills children and 80 years on, it still hasn't lost its power to shock (I can't imagine this film being made in Britain or America). Considering that this was one of the first movies with sound, it's remarkable how well the acting and direction compares with later films. But although it's an ensemble piece, the film is dominated by Peter Lorre as the villian and Gustaf Gründgens as the 'Safecracker', who is concerned that Lorre's activities are making it impossible for the criminal underworld to go about their daily business (Gründgens later became the subject of the 1981 film 'Mephisto').The first part of the film drags, but the second half is gripping and the final scene, where Lorre is being tried by a kangaroo court of local men and women, in a disused warehouse, is incredibly powerful:4. Jo NesbøWhen I wasn't suffering from the agues and ranting deliriously about Matron, I felt reasonably alert and needed something to pass the time. I had just finished 'Isle of Dogs' and wanted another novel that was intelligently written, but easy to read (Proust and 'flu don't go together). I'd read everything by Henning Mankell, so what else was there for people who don't normally read crime fiction?At this point, Amazon came into its own. I checked to see what Henning Mankell readers also liked and saw several glowing reviews for Jo Nesbø. With just a few clicks, I was able to download a sample chapter onto my Kindle and decide for myself.Five days later, I am a huge Nesbø fan and rate the two novels I've read much more highly than the last Kurt Wallander mystery. Unlike some detectives I could mention, Jo Nesbø's Harry Hole isn't divorced and doesn't have a grown-up daughter with whom he has a difficult relationship, but I'm relieved to say that he is a maverick who has a problem with authority and also drinks too much, so we're still on fairly familiar ground.The first Harry Hole novel I read was 'Redbreast' and although there was an over-reliance on coincidence, I was impressed by Nesbø's ability to weave several disparate narrative threads together and create credible characters that don't always fall into the stock clichés of crime fiction. Yes, there is a grumpy, misanthropic forensics officer who is on the verge of retirment and there's also the long-suffering boss who gives the protagonist 24 hours/two days/one week to solve the crime before they're taken off the case. But overall this novel was a refreshing change from what I've seen and I enjoyed the Norwegian setting.By the end of my six days in bed I started to feel better and imagined what life would be like if I could just carry on living like Oblomov, never having to get up again. But back at work the next day, I realised how good it was to feel useful and needed."},

{"title": "A Dull Post About the Book Industry", "date": "Wednesday, May 11, 2011", "text": "Every time I read the trade press, there seems to be yet another story about the growth of e-books. Yesterday alone, the Bookseller published two stories that have huge implications for everyone in the book trade.The first article covered the 'World e-Reading Congress' in London, where Ian Hudson, the deputy chairman of Random House, announced that their e-book sales had increased tenfold in the last year. Hudson predicted that e-book sales \"could exceed 8% of trade publishers' sales in 2011, and could reach 15% next year\".This is interesting, because on the one hand it demonstrates how quickly e-books are growing, but on the other it is a timely reminder that they still account for less than 10% of book sales. If you just listened to Amazon, you could be forgiven for thinking that it was nearer 50%.The other story that the Bookseller published yesterday is also potentially very significant. Literary über-agent Ed Victor has established a new e-book and print-on-demand imprint, which will initially concentrate on making out of print titles available in a digital format. This may not appear to be earth-shattering news, but it shows that the line between agent and publisher may become increasingly blurred in the future.So where does that leave the traditional high street bookshop? On they face of it, they seem doomed. E-book sales are growing exponentially, particularly in the more 'disposable' genres like crime fiction (over a third of the latest Jo Nesbø novel's sales were digital).But although digital publishing may appear to possess the inexorable gravitational pull of a black hole, there are other genres that are far more resistant. For example, this:I read 'Mr Wonderful' recently after a month in the Kindleverse and fell in love with the paper book all over again.These comic strips are  all available online and I'm sure that they'd be quite easy to read on  an iPad, but it would be a very poor substitute for this  beautifully-produced hardback, with its thick, sturdy pages,  brightly-coloured illustrations and wonderfully absurd dimensions (fully  opened, it measures 21\" by 6\").I'm not suggesting that bookshops will be saved by bunging a few graphic novels on the front table, but if they are going to survive they need to reduce their dependence on paperback bestsellers and concentrate on genres where the book itself becomes a desirable object. It is this approach that has enabled 'high end' booksellers like Daunt Books to survive, selling hardbacks to people who are looking for quality rather than saving money.It will be interesting to see what the new owner of Waterstone's does with the chain. At the moment, HMV are locked in negotiations with the Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut. HMV want £70,000,000 for Waterstone's - a sum they desperately need if they are to avoid going into administration in July - and gave Mamut a deadline of April 20th to close the deal.But with each week, HMV's hand becomes weaker. Their share price is now around 10p and Waterstone's latest value is estimated to be nearer £35,000,000, so I suspect that Mr Mamut is quite rightly driving a hard bargain. Why should he pay over the odds for a 300-branch chain that includes a number a loss-making shops when he could hang on for a few weeks and pick off the most profitable shops?I hope that both parties are able to reach an agreement before HMV Group collapses, for everyone's sake. Aside from the fact that several thousand jobs are at stake, the publishing industry needs a showcase for its titles and the large, range-holding specialist bookseller is still the best option.I apologise if that was a very dull post.

To add insult to injury, Hartley didn't get a penny for it, whereas Lord Dundas (aka David \"I've got my blue jeans on - ooh ooh\" Dundas) was paid £10 every time his four-note jingle for the Channel Four ident was played. Life can be very unfair.Anyway, to get to the point, today's illustrations are a good example of how social mores have changed over the last century.We begin with a fine example of manliness and patriotism:This heroic image is at odds with the indiscriminate, mechanised slaughter of trench warfare and I wonder what ex-servicemen must have felt when they saw images like this.Next, we move forward a couple of decades to the Battle of Britain, when the RAF were busy teaching Jerry a lesson:I expect that someone on the boat is saying \"Gott in Himmel!\" - one of the three stock phrases that war comics seemed to use (the other two being, of course \"Achtung Spitfire!\" and \"Schweinhund!\").Viz comic once did a great satire of a Victor-style cartoon strip, in which a German submarine hits a Spitfire by firing a torpedo into the air, but its plucky RAF pilot dives underwater and machine-guns the submarine. It is patently absurd, but this 1940s book, featuring 'Flak' the dog, isn't that far removed from the Viz parody.Sadly, Leonard 'Squiffy' Worthington is eventually shot down and he and Flak are sent to Stalag Luft III, but the ingenuity of the German prisoner of war camp isn't enough to stop man and dog from escaping:Squiffy and Flak want to get back to England and continue fighting the Hun, so that they can make the world safe for young boys to admire swans:'\"Oh! How jolly!\" Bryan exclaimed when first he saw the swan (page 70)''When first he saw the swan'? I didn't know that they had Google Translate back in the late 1940s.Moving forward to 1954, here is a photo featuring 'Fabian of Scotland Yard'. Can you guess which person is Fabian?

On Friday night I reluctantly agreed to go to an 80s disco, which I mistakenly assumed had something to do with the Royal Wedding, but turned out to be a fundraising evening. There wasn't a single person there under 30, apart from a brief moment when two teenagers walked in, took one look and immediately left. I knew how they felt.It was the quinteseential 80s disco: the music was rubbish, I didn't cop off with anyone and the DJ refused to play The Smiths. I'd forgotten how much I hated evenings like this.My mother-in-law thinks that the great tragedy of my life was that I was born in the wrong century and that I should have been a country parson in the Victorian age. Sometimes think she's right.However, I drank a magic potion that enabled me to travel through time (a la 'The Amazing Mr Blunden') to the late 20th century and within an hour I was on the floor dancing (albeit like someone with a slipped disc) to Run DMC, probably cramping Mrs Steerforth's style. Further drinks bought out the inner Travolta and the evening turned out to be almost enjoyable.Naturally I suffered the next day and rather than go out, decided to spend my time sorting through a new album of Victorian photos that arrived at work last week.It's a strange album. The photographs have been taken all over the place, including one from Sydney, so it's hard to tell where the family came from. One picture is dated 1881 but I suspect that some may be older, if the fashions are anything to go by. I have included the original captions:'Great Uncle Brindley, Sydney' - the first Australian studio portrait I've come across. This would have been taken around the same time as Marcus Clarke published 'His Natural Life' - one of the first 'Australian' novels (and a gripping read if you haven't come across it).'Mrs More' - why isn't the gentleman named?This group of 'striking' looking people are sadly unnamedThis woman is also unnamed, but she looks uncannily like an ancestor of Cherie Blair'Aunt Ruth and Aunt Mary' - I don't think that it would be entirely unfair to suggest that Aunt Ruth might have had a few 'issues', if that scowl is anything to go by.There is clearly no doubt surrounding the paternity of this young girl'Cecil, Winnie and Irene' - I wonder when these names will come back into fashion?I shall refrain from passing commentI like the woman's quietly determined expression'Grandfather Moore''1881'UndatedThese last two photographs are also unnnamed and undated.

{"title": "\"If I Could Find Anything Blacker Than Black, I'd Use It\"", "date": "Thursday, April 28, 2011", "text": "Two days ago, my reputation as a member of the middle class intelligensia was almost in tatters.It started innocently enough. I was talking about the Royal Wedding with some people from North London and unthinkingly remarked that I thought that Kate Middleton would make a lovely queen. Obviously this was the wrong thing to say. If you are a Guardianista, you must regard the Royal Family and everything they do as an absurd and rather vulgar anachronism. I had committed a thoughtcrime.Luckily, I got away with it. My companions thought that I was satirising the cap-doffing attitudes of Middle England and laughed politely, unaware that my statement was free of any irony or cynicism.\"She'll be a lovely queen.\"But the whole sorry episode weighed heavily on my conscience. I knew that I had committed a major transgression and only an act of atonement would enable me to look my fellow cognoscenti in the eye. But what? A box of organic vegetables or a bottle of artisan-made balsamic vinegar wouldn't be enough this time. I had to perform the Hadj.The following morning, I began a long, difficult journey of pilgrimage to Margate, home of the newest contemporary art gallery.Margate was once a promised land for the working classes. Families could escape from the drudgery and, sometimes, squalor of their daily lives and spend a couple of weeks in a fantasy world of music hall shows, fairground rides and sunshine: But the two weeks passed too quickly and then it was back to the unlived life. For many Eastenders, the dream was that one day they would go back to Margate and never leave, spending their final days breathing fresh air. The whole town was fuelled by working class dreams (although, incongrously, Eliot wrote the third part of 'The Waste Land' here: 'On Margate Sands. I can connect nothing with nothing').The last time Margate really buzzed with life was in the 1960s, when mods and rockers terrorised the bank holiday crowds:Then the package holiday arrived. People quickly realised that for the same amount of money they could have a holiday in Spain, where the sunshine was almost guaranteed. Like many so British coastal resorts, Margate went into a long, slow decline, beset by high unemployment and under-investment.Which brings us to the present. How do you revitalise a depressed area? Industry is no longer an option and the dreaded 'retail park' may create a few hundred jobs (if you can persuade retailers to set up in a town with no money), but it's a Faustian pact which ultimately does more harm than good to the local economy.The only answer is to attract more middle class people into the town and the best way of doing that is to build an art gallery.Once, the notion that an economically depressed town could be revived with an art gallery (and a modern art gallery at that!) would have sounded absurd, like something out of Sim City, but the evidence is irrefutable.The phenomenal success of the Tate Modern, which opened in 2000, has shown that contemporary art is far more popular than many people believed and the last decade has seen an unprecedented number of successful gallery openings; many in very unlikely places. When these galleries opened, people were suprised by how quickly new businesses started to appear.This was the rationale behind the Turner Contemporary in Margate. It wasn't a universally popular idea - many locals would have prefered a leisure centre - but the gallery had some very vocal supporters, including local girl Tracy Emin:(If the Royal Family met with an unfortunate end, I would quite happily install Tracy Emin as the next queen of England)Like all great building projects, the plans and budget for the Turner Contemporary underwent a number of revisions and compromises, but thanks to the tenacity of its supporters, the gallery was eventually opened earlier this month by Emin and Jools Holland.From a distance, the Turner Contemporary is underwhelming, but the gallery is more impressive as you get closer:Designed by Sir David Chipperfield, the Turner Contemporary boldly faces the sea. Some have questioned the logic of placing a valuable art collection in such a vulnerable position, but the building feels very solid.I was pleased to see that the steps were packed with visitors and as I walked through the entrance, I was struck by how the building was already buzzing with energy, less than a month after opening:This atrium is hugely impressive - a wonderful use of space involving mirrored walls and this stunning view of the sea:I wasn't completely convinced by the steps up to the first floor. Inspired by Turner's enigmatic last words, which could have meant either \"The sun is god\", \"The son is God\" or \"The sun is God\", this all looked a bit like something out of art college:But I liked the next exhibit. I tried to read what it was all about, but there were so many people in the gallery I became distracted and decided to read more on the gallery's website when I got home, but oddly there doesn't seem to be much content about the exhibits.As far as I can tell, it's a mural of work by young people from Margate and reflects on the town's past, present and hopes for the future:I wish that I'd read the blurb more thoroughly.This section contains the great Turner quote \"If I could find anything blacker than black, I'd use it.\"At this point, I should explain (for anyone who is blissfully unaware of the Turner Contemporary) where Turner comes into the story. This is from the gallery's website:“Where therefore, and in this very town of Margate, he lived, when he chose to be quit of London, and yet not to travel” John Ruskin Turner’s connection with Margate was the founding inspiration for our  organisation. He loved Margate for the sea, the skies, and his landlady  Mrs Booth. He first came to the seaside town aged 11, having been sent by his parents to school in Love Lane in Margate. He returned to sketch here aged 21 and from the 1820s onwards became a regular visitor.Visitors who are expecting a collection of Turner paintings will be disappointed. There is only one picture in the collection, although the gallery hopes to remedy this. Admittedly it's a pretty impressive painting, but did it really need a 'tensabarrier' in front?This installation looked promising:Inside, there is a collection of backlit engravings of Margate. It's a nice, contemporary take on the traditional 19th century engraving and the images are really good, but unfortunately it is impossible to look at them without seeing a reflection of the works on the wall behind. It's a great pity and I'm surprised that nobody has done anything about this (a simple black curtain across the centre would solve the problem).This remarkable installation, by Conrad Shawcross, was far more successful:In the art world, people are forever talking about 'the space' as being almost as important as the exhibits and in general, I'd agree. The Turner Contemporary is a fantastic 'space', but there's just a little too much of it. I would have liked to have seen some more exhibits. There is clearly some work to be done (including the amount of content on the website), but the gallery has got off to a good start.At the moment, to coin Dr Johnson's description of the Giant's Causeway, the Turner Contemporary is \"worth seeing, but not worth going to see\", at least, if your journey is longer than a couple of hours. It took me over three hours to make the 90-mile trip from Lewes.On the plus side  there's a nice cafe in the gallery and it's only a matter of time before a succession of chi-chi resaturants and shops appear in this nearby road:The future definitely looks brighter for Margate. Sadly, this will be the last new gallery in Britain for the foreseeable future.Even if the Turner Contemporary doesn't have enough exhibits to justify a day trip, there's plenty to see in Margate and if you prefer your resorts to be a little more genteel, Broadstairs is only a couple of miles away:I've never been to this part of Kent before and was impressed by the number of quirky, interesting buildings, including the original model for 'Bleak House', which towers above the beach:Charles Dickens was a big fan of Broadstairs:I had obviously come on a quiet day:As Dickens might have said, \"I searched in vain for a fish and chip emporium that was open for travellers and instead, decided to embark on an agreeable perambulation of the town's environs\".The alleys and back streets revealed many eccentric features, like this nautical gate:It goes without saying that I am a big fan of 'David Copperfield', so I didn't miss the chance to visit the house which was owned by the model for Betsey Trotwood and now contains the Dickens Museum. It's strange to think the young Dickens sat in this very room:The museum was a little disappointing. Apart from a few letters written by the author, it was mainly a collection of Dickens-related ephemera (with no pictures of Steerforth), but with an entrance fee of around £3, it was still worth a visit.I finished the day by having a brief drink in Deal with an old schoolfriend. He has just joined a French punk band and told me some hilarious stories, which would be a whole blog post in itself. I know that he hates anything to do with blogging and social networking, so I will shamelessly steal his anecdotes.After our drink, I began the ridiculously long journey back to Lewes. At first I resented the fact that it took over three hours to make a 90-mile journey, but on reflection, if we had more motorways and better rail links, everywhere would turn into commuterland."},
{"title": "Tower Power", "date": "Sunday, April 24, 2011", "text": "Last year, my mother-in-law was struggling to think of something to buy me for my birthday and asked if there was anything that I particularly wanted. There wasn't. I live in a small house that's under permanent siege from an army of plastic toys and DVDs - one more thing would only add to the clutter. But I still wanted a present.Then I realised that what I needed was an experience, not a possession. I knew that my mother-in-law had just enjoyed a private tour of the Tower of London and asked if she could arrange one for me. I'd been to the Tower once as a child, but the sight of hordes of badly dressed, bumbelt-wearing tourists had put me off making a return visit.A private viewing was the perfect solution.The tour was booked for last Wednesday and I can't stress how satisfying it was to walk past the long queue of tourists and have a Beefeater lift up a rope to let me in. Queue jumping is a petty, slightly malicious pleasure that plays to my vain conceit that I'm a cut above the hoi polloi (I know I'm not, but it's fun pretending for a few minutes).Once we were inside the Tower complex, I was struck by how separate it felt from the rest of London, as if we were in an independent city state like the Vatican, with only a tenuous connection to the present. Everywhere we looked, there were reminders of the Tower's sad, brutal history.I knew about some of the more famous executions: Thomas Moore, Anne Boleyn and Lady Jane Grey, but this anecdote was new to me:'In 1541, it was the turn of the 71-year-old Margaret, Countess of  Salisbury, whose offence was being the last surviving member of the  Plantagenet dynasty, overthrown by the Tudors. The Countess refused to  place her head on the block, and had to be chased around the green by  the executioner, who hacked her to death.' (From www.icons.org)If you like your historical buildings to be a bit \"Hey-nonny-no\",  where you can almost hear the sound of lutes playing, I'd recommend  Hampton Court Palace. The Tower of London is all about power and retribution. Initially built to dissuade the English from rebelling against their new masters, it is now said to be the only building in London that would still be standing in a thousand years if we all suddenly became extinct.At one point my mother-in-law turned to me and said \"Well, you must have one and a half blog posts here.\" But I haven't. What can you say about 900 years of history that hasn't already been said?One of the highlights of the visit was seeing the tomb of Sir Thomas More, which is in the crypt of St Peter ad Vincula.  The crypt isn't open to the public and I was told that very few people are allowed to see it:I was going to start writing about how much I admire Sir Thomas More, but I quickly realised that the entire basis of my knowledge comes from watching Paul Schofield in 'A Man For All Seasons', so it's probably better to shut up. However, it is a very good film and this final scene is very moving:The other highlight of the visit was seeing Henry VIII's suit of armour, with it's absurd codpiece. Apparently, in the 16th century, it was fashionable to accentuate the male features (but mitigate the female ones):This Cylon-style armour was made in the 1540s, when Henry had put on a few pounds. But there were also other suits of armour from the days when Henry was the svelte renaissance prince who composed 'Pastime with Good Company'. It was the first and last time a member of the Royal Family wrote a chart hit.If you're not familiar with the song, here's my crude, two-part arrangement:Not a bad tune is it? Sorry about the performance.Once we'd seen the armour, we decided to give the Crown Jewels a miss and decamp to the nearest pub. As I nursed my thirst-quenching pint of Amstell, I reflected on how lucky I was to be born in a more civilised age.Just as I thought this, a City banker entered with a much younger woman who clearly wasn't his wife, and found a discreet booth where they couldn't be spotted by any colleagues:We may not hack elderly duchesses to death, but greed, lust and betrayal still have their part to play in London life."},

{"title": "RIP Elisabeth Sladen (or Goodbye Sarah Jane Smith)", "date": "Tuesday, April 19, 2011", "text": "I was really upset to hear this evening's announcement that the actress Elisabeth Sladen has died at the age of 63, after a long (and well hidden) struggle with cancer. I suspect that a lot of people of my age, who were children in the 1970s, will mourn the death of 'Sarah Jane'.It's strange how we can let so many tragic news stories wash over us, but feel genuine grief when a much-loved television presenter or actor from our childhood dies. I suppose it's not just because we feel an affection for them, but also because they were part of that secure wall that protects us from the uncomfortable reality of our own mortality. Every time a well-known figure from the older generation dies, the wall weakens and the world becomes slightly less familiar.The following clip shows Elisabeth Sladen's final scene in Doctor Who (until she revived the character of Sarah Jane Smith 30 years later). It's particularly moving now and also shows what a great actress she was, portraying a character that was both ballsy and vulnerable at the same time:But it won't just be people of my generation who'll be upset. Elisabeth Sladen's career underwent a spectacular renaissance four years ago with the 'Sarah Jane Adventures'.What am I going to tell my sons?"},
{"title": "After the Edwardians", "date": "Saturday, April 16, 2011", "text": "Yesterday, another photograph album appeared in the office. Almost as if it was continuing a narrative, the photos began in the Edwardian age, where this recent post ended.The people featured in these images are more solidly middle class, but their story is no different to last week's family. Born in the Victorian age, they grew up in the cosy complacency of the fin de siècle, unaware of the catastrophe that was about to change their world.In these photographs, it is the women's fashions that are the most telling indicator of social change. The contrast between the impractical, 'feminine' outfits of the Edwardian era and the more austere, utilitarian clothing of the 1920s is striking. It's as if 50 years have passed rather then ten.When my father died I inherited a lot of papers, including an unfinished family history project. I probably won't complete it, as my family isn't terribly interesting (even to me), but I did gain an important insight into the impact the First World War had on my ancestors. Reading between the lines, it was quite clear that my grandmother had had a nervous breakdown after her older brother went 'missing' after the Battle of Loos. It was never acknowledged as a breakdown, but she was unable to work for six years.Much has been written about 'shell shock' but what was the psychological impact on a generation of women who lost brothers, fathers, husbands, sweethearts and friends? (I think it's time to read 'Testament of Youth')In the meantime, here are the photos:This woman features in many of the pictures. I like her intelligent, enquiring face and clear eyes. She looks like someone who would have been worth meeting. I wonder if our lives overlapped?Her she is as a teenager:This is a wonderful picture of three generations and I felt that it deserved to be enlarged:I know exactly how the girl feels, but I now also empathse with the father. I like the way the grandmother is ignoring the photographer and continuing to write her letter.If I had a time machine, I'd type in the coordinates of this scene and join them. I particularly like the straw hamper and boater.This genetleman seems remarkably sanguine, given that he's sitting directly undernerneath a raw sewerage outflow pipe.This Wild West picture was turned into a postcard. On the back, it mentions a photographic studio in Clapham. As usual there are few names, dates or places in the actual album (I never discovered the name of the woman), but I found one reference to a street in Raynes Park. By a strange coincidence, their family home was in the same road as my father-in-law's house.This photo reveals the gulf between the older and younger generations. I wonder, which of these men returned from the Front?This man is named in the album as Harold Duncan-Teape. A quick Google search reveals that he was a major in the 4th battalion of the London Regiment of the Royal Fusiliers during the First World War. According to another reference, from the Illustrated London News, Duncan Teape died in Croydon on October 23rd, 1929.The fashions are clearly different in this photo - less florid and more practical, striking a stark contrast with the clothes of the previous decade.I have no idea what this occasion is - the first Rembrance Day, perhaps?'Uncle Jim'This isn't a young David Cameron. Apparently he's called Ian. The young woman's name isn't mentioned, but I expect she's called Pam.Here's Ian again, enjoying the nautical life. It looks like a cruise ship, but I suppose it could be Bournemouth Pier.We like to complain about the sexualisation of children these days, pressurised by the media into growing up too soon, but what about these girls, forced to dress up as 'flappers'? I'm sure they'd rather be riding ponies and solving mysteries.By now, the stuffy world of the Edwardians has vanished and no-one stands still long enough to remain in focus. And isn't that Ian in the background, enjoying it all?I don't want to over-egg the 'World War One as an agent of social change' pudding - Marinetti's Futurist Manifesto was published in 1909 and the evidence suggests that the First World War was a sympton rather than the cause. But if the status quo had remained, would Western society have undergone the huge seismic shift that took place in the 1920s?The album ends in the late 1940s. The woman with the beautiful eyes lost her looks and became overweight, Uncle Jim disappeared into the ether and the group photographs suggest that the Victorians were no longer around either. But there are lots of photos of children playing and laughing, breathing new life into the sleepy suburb of SW20."},

{"title": "Edwardians", "date": "Saturday, April 09, 2011", "text": "Two days ago, hidden in a box of spore-infested reprints of Dickens novels, we found a small album of photographs from the Edwardian era. The photos were in poor condition: badly faded, scratched and covered in marks, but I hoped that I might be able to retrieve some of the ghost-like images from oblivion with the help of Photoshop.I'm quite please with the result. Here is the original image:And here's the restored version:It's not bad. I wish I that had the time to spend hours lovingly restoring each photo, but this is the best I can do at the moment.As usual, none of the photos are accompanied by any names, places or dates, but I'm pretty sure that I can place them within the Edwardian era rather than the Victorian.Here's the evidence :It's not conclusive, but from the brief amount of research I've put into this post (i.e. 10 minutes), the vehicles make it unlikely that these pictures were taken before 1901.The following photos have a beguiling innocence about them that belie the dark social and political uncurrents of the times. As has been mentioned before, there's something terribly poignant about the image of a smiling Edwardian boy, unaware of what's in store for his generation in a few years time.(Note the telephone line and gasworks in the background)(The original image was so badly faded, I almost threw it away. I'm glad that I didn't)I love this image, with the bare trees and the woman's reflection in the water. Here is a close-up:It's incredibly satisfying to be able to rescue these images and give them a whole new lease of life on the internet. They may just be family snapshots, but they give a tantalising glimpse into a world that, superficially, seemed at ease with itself, but was actually about to change beyond all recognition.Within a mere 20 years, the smiling young boy in the fourth photo would be living (if he survived the trenches) in the age of Freud, Vorticism, Webern, Freud, Mrs Dalloway, Ulysses and jazz."},

However, she did experience one spooky moment during a lecture on postwar urban poverty.It began innocuously enough with an introductory talk, followed by a slide show of grim, black and white scenes of urban deprivation. My colleague was relaxing in her chair, absorbed by the images being beamed by the projector.Suddenly, to her horror, a picture appeared on the wall of her mother dragging a mattress down a street. The lecturer calmly deconstructed the image, explaining its context and meaning, unaware that the woman's daughter was sitting a few feet away from him.What a shining example of social mobility.Apparently, the lecturer was unaware of the photo's true origins. It was taken by my colleague's aunt, who threatened to thump her younger sister unless she posed for the picture with a mattress. The aunt, who grew up on a grim council estate, started to make a name for herself as a photographer, but inexplicably gave it up after a year.Sadly I don't have a copy of the image with the mattress, but here is another striking photo, featuring my colleague's uncle on the right:"},
{"title": "Clarke Hutton's Australia", "date": "Monday, April 04, 2011", "text": "As I have written before, I used to assume that Google was some sort of magical portal to the sum total of human knowledge. However, when I began my current job, I realised how limited the internet really was.Clarke Hutton is a perfect example of this. Google his name and you will find a pitifully small number of articles, including this post, which I wrote in October. He was a highly-respected illustrator in his day - the middle of the 20th century - but appears to have been almost completely forgotten.Last week I discovered a 1950s children's history of Australia, which was illustrated by Hutton. I have no idea if he ever went there.Hutton's illustrations are more conventional than the ones in his 'Picture History of Britain'. Perhaps that's because the contemporary aesthetic had changed and the angular, neo-Modernist style was no longer in fashion.  But even Clarke Hutton, at his most watered-down and conventional, has a quality that demands attention:Apparently there are several titles available with Hutton illustrations, so I'll try to post some more in the near future."},
{"title": "The Last Seven Days", "date": "Friday, April 01, 2011", "text": "I normally try to find a linking theme to justify the random images that I regularly post, but there isn't one this week. Like life, today's post seems meaningless but might be occasionally interesting. You may disagree.First (or should I say \"First up\", because I've noticed that a lot of television announcers have started doing this), I really like this 1962 photo of two women who might have been 'flappers' in their youth. It fell out of a book. I remember great-aunts who wore hats like this, even in the 1980s. When their backs were turned, my friend and I would try them on.Also from the 1960s, this family photo of children in their 'Sunday best'. It's strange how the mini skirt phenomenon affected children's fashions. My mother went to a school like this and was frequently caned for talking during the lessons. When the war broke out, a lot of the younger teachers left to do 'active service' and they were replaced with Victorian women who had been called out of retirement. She remembers lots of very austere, but slightly confused old ladies.\"Number Forty!\" squealed Pam, \"that's father's boat.\"I love this frontispiece illustration and the accompanying text (apart from the grammatical error).Is anyone under 50 called Pam? Many names have gone out of fashion, but while I've bumped into the odd Derek and Terry, I've never met a post-1960s Pam. As a name, it isn't aesthetically pleasing - Pam, ham, spam, clam, wham bam thank you mam, etc. Apologies to any Pams out there.I don't even like my own name, which sounds like the dull thud of a wet, freshly-caught Mackerel landing on the deck of a fishing vessel: phil-ip.On the subject of vessels:This illustration is from the good old days when dark beards were synonymous with foreignness and Bolshevism.I'm not sure how well-researched this novel was. Did Mr Jorgensen spend months accompanying the Royal Canadian Air Force Smoke Jumpers? I'm not convinced that a few men in red costumes would be enough to stop a major forest fire.This comes from an A4 journal I found last week, recording the progress of the 'Gloucestershire German Speaking Club'.Beginning in 1938, the book records a vibrant social calendar, including this annual dinner dance:Apparently, they had Bayrisches Tutti Frutti for pudding, although the local press ommitted to mention that:Here are the leading lights of the Gloucestershire Deutsche Sprachklub:I shall refrain from stating the obvious. Sadly, the journal comes to an abrupt halt in the summer of 1939. I wonder what happened to them?Finally, on Wednesday I took my son up to the London Aquarium, as part of his home education routine. I was very impressed by everything I saw, but I particularly liked this:My son also loved the aquarium and when we entered the dreaded gift shop, I was more than happy to buy something that would cultivate his interest in marine life. But all I could find were cuddly toys of sharks, and these:I think they're fridge magnets.I also saw a stand containing some unusual candle holders:Who buys these things? I can't begin to imagine the horror that any sane person must feel on receiving one of these as a gift.I much prefer this heartfelt message, which I received on a birthday card from a good friend:\"Another year older. Another year nearer the nameless terrors of the grave.\""},
{"title": "Kindling", "date": "Tuesday, March 29, 2011", "text": "Until last week, kindling was always a common noun in my house. I have a huge bag of it next to my Danish piano (an unusual instrument, that looks as if it's been stolen from an infants' school gymnasium). However, during the last seven days it has become a verb for something completely unrelated to fire, although it has had an incendiary effect on the book trade.I have written many derisive comments about the Amazon Kindle and ebooks in general. As someone who has spent most of their working life in the book trade, it was the default position to take. I love books. For all their worthiness, books are surprisingly sensual objects, engaging all of the senses except taste. Ebooks were the enemy: drab, monochrome devices, reducing every reading experience to uniform fonts, grey backgrounds and a dependence on electricity.However, like most puritans, I was a hypocrite, secretly fascinated by the ebook phenomenon.I first saw an ebook in 2000. It looked like an upmarket Psion Organiser and I was underwhelmed, but slightly unnerved by the realisation that something better would appear in a year or two. However, fours years on, ebooks still showed no sign of making any inroads into the book trade and a lot of people were content to bury their heads in the sand.It says a lot about the book trade that during the mid-'noughties', The Friday Project were regarded as 'zeitgeisty' for turning web content into paper books. We had no idea.The Amazon Kindle was launched on November 19th 2007 and sold out in under six hours. Customers had to wait for five months before the Kindle was back in stock. But in spite of the apparent demand, the Kindle had a neglible effect on book sales and at the time, it looked like a geeky toy that would never break through into the mass market.But last year, everything changed. The third generation Kindle was one of the bestselling Christmas presents of 2010 and sales of ebooks began to affect the bestseller charts. Admittedly, this was largely driven by Amazon, who were keen to reduce their warehousing and postage costs by selling ebooks, but nobody could deny that the Kindle was changing the way people bought books.I became increasingly obsessed by the Kindle and railed against it in various blog posts, but somebody saw straight through me and said that I was on the \"verge of Kindledom\".Last week, I asked people to give me reasons for not buying a Kindle and received a number of interesting comments which helped me make up my mind.  The following day, I ordered one:These book titles are quite apposite and I like the \"Welcome Philip\" - everyone calls me Phil apart from Amazon and my mother. That's how it should be.It took a while to get used to the light grey screen, but overall I like the Kindle. I had very low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. As some people have said, it doesn't replace the printed page, but it does provide an interesting alternative.I like the fact that I can order the new Henning Mankell - a book I will probably never read again - without having to go through the process of travelling to a bookshop or ordering a hardback, only to find a slip on my doormat saying that the parcel was too big for my letterbox. I also love Project Gutenberg, which enables me to download any one of thousands of classics in under a minute.What I don't like about the Kindle is the conspicuous absence of most titles published between the 1940s (the threshold of copyright) and four years ago. These titles are all not available in Kindle format:The Unbearable Lightness of BeingThe Great Railway BazaarThe SonglinesMr Norris Changes TrainsThe Stone DiariesBrightness FallsThe Slaves of SolitudeBlindnessThe Well of LonelinessI Capture the CastleThe Dice ManThe Accidental TouristThings Fall ApartThe Female EunuchMoon PalaceThe Bone PeopleGuns, Germs and SteelMiss Smila's Feeling For SnowThe Tin DrumThe Ordeal of Gilbert PinfoldI could go on.Obviously these gaps will gradually be filled, but at the moment I'm impressed by how many books aren't available as downloads, in spite of the hyperbole. We could probably all live without The Bone People and The Dice Man, but Blindness? Come on Random House!In spite of this, as a reader, I like the Kindle more than I thought I would. As a bookseller, I feel nervous. My project at work is going well and on its own merits, is pretty Kindle-proof, but it is completely dependent on a larger business that sells used paperbacks for a penny on Amazon marketplace. If they go under, so do I.Last week was my best ever, but in spite of that, I could still be out of a job. I won't be taking out any loans for the time being.It's hard to know what will happen, as the success of ebooks depends on a number of factors. If digital books become as easy to illegally download and share as MP3 files, then book trade as we know it may be largely finished, apart from niche areas like titles for young children. But on the other hand, people have a greater emotional attachment to books than they did to records, tapes and CDs, so the reading world may be more pluralistic.I bought a Kindle for two reasons. First, I wanted to understand at first hand the phenomenon that is having such a large impact on the industry I work in. Second, I loved the Kindle's space-saving properties. My small, Victorian terraced house is slowly sinking under the weight of books, many of which I'll never read again. I don't need a hardback copy of the latest Henning Mankell. I'd rather save the shelf space for books that are particularly beautiful.I know that some people may cry \"Judas!\", but I've tried to remain open minded and the pro-Kindle comments on this blog have been so eloquent and well-argued, I had to find out for myself.Jonathan Main (aka Bookseller Crow) wrote this excellent article on the Kindle, arguing that \"It is functional in the way that listening to Mozart on a transistor  radio is convenient in the circumstances but ultimately completely  unfullfilling\". However, I think we have to separate the message from the medium. I was all geared-up to hate the Kindle, but was surprised to find that once I was immersed in the text, I forgot that I was even reading one.Of course, when we enter the next dark age, all of our digitised culture will disappear in a puff of smoke and the Riddley Walkers of the future will be denied the pleasure of reading The Da Vinci Code.Now there's a thought.P.S - STOP PRESS - Visit Bookseller Crow's blog for this funny, poignant anecdote about the threat of ebooks."},

Hopefully, she'll earn enough to pay for our next holiday in France, so I don't want to get in her way.However, I managed to take advantage of a quiet moment to scan some images from a Victorian children's book from the 1880s:This link contains a very brief biographical sketch about the illustrator, Alice Havers, who was a member of the Society of Lady Artists and exhibited her work at the Royal Academy.The biographical sketch describes her pictures of children as \"sentimental\" and \"pretty awful\" and I can't say I passionately disagree, but there is something captivating about her idyllic, pastoral scenes. It isn't just the contrast these images strike with childhood today, but also the reality of the 1880s.How many Victorian children lived like this:Alice Mary Havers married the artist Frederick Morgan and they had three children. Sadly, she died in her 40th year, in 1890."},
{"title": "Crime and Punishment", "date": "Monday, March 21, 2011", "text": "For the last two weeks my life has stopped. Reading, blogging and all  forms of social interaction have taken second place to my obsession with  a Danish television crime drama called 'Forbrydelsen' ('The Crime')  which is being shown in the UK as 'The Killing'.Apparently, the viewing figures on BBC Four are higher than Mad Men and as this Guardian link  clearly shows, it has been a huge hit with the chattering classes.  Cynics might sneer and say that the intelligensia will happily watch  prime time television as long as it has subtitles, but 'Forbrydelsen' is  a great work of drama on its own merits.I've no doubt that part  of the appeal is the Scandinavian crime factor - the snake in the  Garden of Eden. Police procedurals tend to be less compelling in  countries where corruption and violence are a normal part of everyday  life. A Swedish-style detective mystery set in Bogota would be as  incongruous as a steamy, Magical Realist novel set in Wallander's Skåne.On  the subject of books (he said, seamlessly moving from television to  publishing), I have been following several developments in the book  trade.First, it looks as if the last major bookshop chain in Britain  is about to have a change of ownership. HMV, who have owned Waterstone's  for the last decade, have been in a state of decline for years. They  failed to fully embrace the digital age and are now being punished for  their lack of foresight. By the time they had a chief executive who  understood the challenges posed by Amazon and illegal downloads, it was  too late.However, it has taken HMV a long time to swallow any  humble pie. During the last few years,  several 'entertainment'  retailers have gone to the wall, including Woolworths, Virgin, Silver  Screen, Tower Records and Fopp. Each time, HMV has increased its market  share of these ever decreasing circles, giving City investors the  impression that the senior management knew what they were doing. They didn't.Sadly, for the last ten years, Waterstone's have  been saddled with a management team who thought that the key to  survival was to run the business on sound retail principals, tackling  Amazon and the supermarkets head-on.  This was a huge mistake, as  Waterstone's competitors could always afford to take a bigger hit and  reduce their prices even further.I don't know if bookshop chains  have any future. The last few months in Britain, Australia and the USA  would suggest that the age of the high street bookseller is over. It's  quite possible that the change in the way people buy books will make any  high street bookselling chain untenable, but my gut feeling is that  there are still enough people out there who want real books to make a  small chain sustainable.During the next few weeks, it's possible  that Tim Waterstone will finally regain control of the chain that bears  his name, helped by a 'sugar daddy' in the form of Russian oligarch  Alexander Mamut. It might turn out to be a Faustian pact, but could it  be any worse that being saddled to a sinking music chain?Waterstone's  isn't sustainable in it current incarnation - we don't need 300  branches. Interestingly, the original chain only had 36 shops, but the  brand had such a good reputation that a succession of bookshop chains  were 'rebadged' - Sherrat and Hughes, Dillons, Hatchards, Ottakar's and  Books etc - a sort of retail homeopathy, where an increasingly diluted  formula was expected to retain its original properties.The  second development that I've been following is the controversy over the  selling of ebooks by the agency model. This is a very important issue  that hasn't received the press coverage that it deserves, but luckily  Sam Jordison has written a very succinct summary of the issues involved  and the apparent collusion betwen the EU and Amazon.You can find his article here.Finally,  I've been continuing to try and get my head around the Kindle  phenomenon, separating the hype from the reality. Amazon are  understandably promoting the Kindle at every available opportunity and I  take their bestseller lists and positive customer reviews with a pinch  of salt. But when regular visitors to this blog and colleagues at work  start waxing lyrical about the Kindle, my resistance starts to weaken,  in spite of this excellent article by Jonathan Main.I  still think that there are many good reasons to have reservations about  the Kindle. I don't like the 'golden handcuffs' relationship with  Amazon - I abandoned iTunes for the same reason. I've also noticed that a  large number of really important backlist titles (for example, Paul  Theroux's Great Railway Bazaar and Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel)  aren't available in Kindle format. So the jury's still out, but living  in a small house with limted storage space, I am tempted.Is there anyone out there who has a Kindle and hates it? Talk me out of buying one before it's too late. Please."},
{"title": "Lebensraum", "date": "Tuesday, March 15, 2011", "text": "My project at work seems to be going from strength to strength. I have a first-rate team working for me and every other week, sales reach an all-time high. Things have come a long way from two years ago, when I worked alone in a vast, empty, open-plan office, wondering if I'd ever be able to make a living out of the strange assortment of books and ephemera that arrived in the warehouse below.But there is one threat to our growth: we are running out of space. If we can't double our inventory within the next six months, then the project will start to lose momentum and we may have to throw away perfectly good books to make room for the newer titles.I've no doubt that someone thought that they were doing me a huge favour when they suggested that we move into this abandoned warehouse, only a minute's walk from my current office:When I first saw this building, I thought I had entered a scene of post-apocalyptic desolation, reminiscent of the Tarkovsky film Stalker. The ground was littered with abandoned objects, giving the impression that its inhabitants had left in a hurry during an emergency:It didn't get any better inside:When I reached the top of the stairs, I was greeted by the sight of a dead pigeon: I was told that the warehouse was \"purpose built\", but for what? Abducting and torturing political prisoners? The only thing missing was a bare lightbulb.Back in the air-conditioned comfort of my office, I found these wonderful covers:It's very rare to find an 80-year-old book with its original dustjacket. I don't know why people didn't hang on to them the way we do today, particularly when the cover design is as appealing as this, but I don't think that dustjackets were regarded as an integral part of the book (please feel free to correct me on this, as I'm only guessing).I love the font of this prescient book, which was published in 1934.This title was published in 1969 and the cover design's elegant, modernist simplicity is typical of textbooks from this period. I would have probably made the tree more abstract, as it looks a little incongruous, but I still like the cover.I also admire the clear, understated design of this cover, published a couple of years after 'The Birth of Modern Ireland'.But nobody could call this jacket design understated:This absurb dustjacket design  lays itself open to a number of interpretations. Judging by the look of horror on the young man's face, I can only assume that the monkey committed a faux pas when passing the port.What will happen to book jackets in the age of the Kindle?I seem to be ranting about the Kindle a lot at the moment and as Martin H so perceptively observed, this may be because I'm \"teetering on the edge of Kindledom\"."},

{"title": "Off the Road", "date": "Thursday, March 10, 2011", "text": "Two weeks ago, I was driving back from East Anglia in my dull, but dependable, Citroën Xsara Picasso, marvelling at the fact that it had never let me down in 81,000 miles. Like some arranged marriages, I initially had a strong feeling of revulsion when I bought it. It wasn't just the painfully slow acceleration, but also the strong smell of dog, which permeated every item of clothing I wore, however brief the journey.But gradually the canine odours faded and I grew used to the car's stolid, philosophical nature. For this stage of my life - a father of two with an elderly mother - it ticked all of the boxes. The boot space was ample enough to smuggle a whole family through customs, whilst the seating was comfortable and spacious. I congratulated myself on my choice.Almost as if in response to these fatuous thoughts, a warning light flashed on the dashboard and the car started to loose its power. Fortunately, the hills of Lewes loomed in the distance and I was able to freewheel downhill to a local garage, where I assumed that the car would be fixed and I'd be back on the road within 24 hours.That was two weeks ago. During this time, the fault in my car has acquired the same mythical status as the Higgs Boson particle and I have begun to wonder if I will ever drive again.In the meantime, I have been commuting to work by train. As the crow flies, it isn't a long journey, but the costs are double and it usually takes at least twice as long. How can we hope to lure people away from using cars under these conditions?On a good day, my commute has been taking one hour and 40 minutes: one mile to Lewes station, a train journey involving a couple of changes, followed by another mile on foot. It would be tolerable if the line passed through spectacular scenery, but for most of the journey all I can see is badly-designed 20th century housing.Even \"funky\", \"happening\" Brighton doesn't look that great at 6:55am:The one positive is that I'm able to read, provided that nobody is disturbing me. Unfortnately I have a very poor attention span and will easily be distracted by mobile phones, attractive women, the number of abandoned footballs on the railway track, MP3 players and the headlines on someone else's newspaper. It takes me a long time to read a book.To my great surprise, I haven't seen any Kindles yet. Perhaps my local railway line just isn't zeitgeisty enough, but after all the hype from Amazon I was expecting to come across at least one Kindle  reader.From a voyeuristic point of view, I love seeing what people are reading and don't look forward to the anonymity of the Kindle. You can tell a lot about someone by the way they dress, but it's their reading material that is most illuminating. When the soberly-dressed man sitting opposite me got out a Stephen Donaldson book, last week, I had a much clearer sense of who he was.Sometimes people's reading choices are refreshingly unpredictble. I'll never forget the Mr T lookalike at Clapham Junction who was clutching a well-thumbed Catherine Cookson novel, or the \"chavvy\" girl with Elizabeth Duke jewelery and a Primark hoodie who was engrossed in W. G. Sebald's 'Rings of Saturn'.Books instantly change my perception of people. The rather gorgeous woman sitting opposite suddenly loses her allure when she produces a copy of a misery memoir, whilst the shallow-looking city worker instantly goes up in my estimation with his copy of Maupassant's 'Bel Ami'. In a world full of e-books, I'd be limited to judging people on appearances only (I know that there's another option - don't be so judgemental - but that would take all the fun out of travelling) .However, it would be a relief to be able to read a trashy thriller without anyone knowing. I love the anonymity provided by MP3 players (if I appear to be close to tears when listening to a piece of music, you'll never know that I'm actually listening to 'Two Little Boys') and would be tempted to buy a Kindle for this reason alone.In the meantime, if you're on a train from Brighton and see a man pretending to read a very erudite book about Islam or existentialism, but who is clearly more interested in the seagull standing on a nearby chimney pot, that'll be me."},

So far, I haven't found anything amazing, but I have been touched by these photographs of a married couple:These pictures of a couple, called Eddie and Irene, cover the best part of half a century.

{"title": "Last Week", "date": "Saturday, February 26, 2011", "text": "The last few weeks have been rather challenging. First, we had to remove our oldest son from school and are now 'home educating' him - a last resort that I wouldn't have entertained unless I was convinced that every other option had been explored. Second, my mother has surprised us all by selling her house within ten days of putting it on the market. I now have to find somewhere for her to live, organise the move and help her get rid of any unwanted furniture.Fortunately, we were able to get away to my mother-in-law's house for a few days and I took the opportunity to pay a visit to the wonderful Gainsborough Museum in Sudbury, Suffolk.Sudbury is one of those pleasant market towns that, like Lewes, got left behind by the Industrial Revolution and went from being one of the most populous settlements to a relative backwater. Most of the buildings are pre-20th century and every street has a variety of quirky, eye-catching features:This house is unusual enough, even without the figures in the top-right window:I also liked the local church, St Gregory's, which is definitely worth a visit if you're in the area (if you aren't, this excellent website is a pretty good substitute).But I don't just enjoy snooping around empty churches for their historical interest. I also enjoy the glimpse they give into the secret life of middle England:There is something comforting about the parish noticeboard, with its posters advertising flower festivals, slide shows and amateur dramatics, run by people with names like Pam, Sheila and Malcolm. I may not want to see Brian's slide show about the Dutch tulip fields, but I feel strangely reassured by its existence.The house where Gainsborough was born is tucked away in a quiet back street and looked disconcertingly small. Fortunately, it is deceptively spacious, with a number of rooms like this one:Gainsborough's home became a museum in 1961 and over the last 50 years, the collection has steadily grown. I noticed that several paintings had been donated \"in lieu of inheritance tax\".I used to regard Gainsborough as a bit of a lightweight, but a wonderful Tate exhibition in 2002 completely changed my mind and I've wanted to visit this museum ever since. As small museums go, this is one of the better ones, but I was hoping to see more of the well-known paintings, like Mr and Mrs Andrews.Apart from the traffic the hurtling through the town centre, I liked Sudbury. It had managed to avoid the worst aspects of postwar town planning and still had a very distinct character, unlike most of Colchester, which I visited a day earlier:Colchester is the oldest recorded town in Britain and some of the original Roman walls - nearly 2,000 years old - still remain around the fringes of the centre. You would imagine that they would occupy pride of place in the town, but intstead the local authorities have sandwiched them between a busy ring road and some bland, 1980s buildings. It's shameful.On a more positive note, I found some superb things at work:These illustrations are from an early 20s German children's novel called 'Frau Major's Daughters'. I was very surprised to find that the book wasn't even worth a fiver.I wish I could look at illustrations like this without thinking of some dark, kinky subtext. Oh, to be innocent again!I also liked the cover of 'The Crimson Rust' (also worth less than £5), which I'm sure Pam, Sheila and Malcolm would have enjoyed when they were children:Finally, two photographs:I quite like this group photograph of some Victorian tennis players, but my favourite by far has to be this:Unusually, this photo actually has some information written on the back:\"Chief Civil Engineer's Office, KINGS CROSS (Great Northern Railway), Christmas Eve 1954\"I presume that the Chief Engineer is the very serious-looking man at the front, rather than the cad with the moustache or the 13-year-old boy at the back.I apologise for the rambling, fragmented nature of this post. It has been that sort of week."},
{"title": "A Manchester Family", "date": "Monday, February 21, 2011", "text": "Today's collection of photos come from a huge haul - the largest I've  seen - that appeared on my desk late on Friday afternoon. I've barely  scratched the surface, but the following images are the ones that made  an immediate impression.It will take time to trawl through the contents. So far, all I know is that the family in these pictures lived in a council house in Manchester. They may also have had an Irish connection, as there are lots of photos of rugged scenery and priests:This photo would be entirely unremarkable, if it wasn't for the fact that the man looks as he is emerging from a hole in the ground.It's a novelty to see anyone on a scooter these days, particularly an older woman. But in my childhood, I remember several local mums and grannies beeping at me as they whizzed past, with several bags of shopping precariously balanced at the back.An idyllic scene. Would a scooter holiday be feasible on today's congested roads, with juggernauts and 4x4s rushing past?Is she really grabbing the seagull by the foot?I'm fairly certain that the seagull-assaulting scooterist is an older incarnation of the girl of the middle.I had no idea that flat caps were so big in the north - literally. In my family photos, even the poorest men usually wore hats, but caps were obviously de rigeur in this part of the world.I rather like this woman's tea cosy-style hat (I shall refrain from passing comment about anyone else in the picture).The caravan holiday: outdoor loos, gas lighting and a communal water pump. A far cry from today's caravans, with their en suite bedrooms, satellite televisions and electric ovens.There are many photos of holidays in the British Isles, but also a few from more exotic locations like Gozo:Out of the hundreds of black and white photos in the collection, this one stood out: a lovely portrait, beautifully lit and composed.I also like the 'staged' pose in this photo.I though that rowing was supposed to be a pleasurable activity, but the grim expressions on these people's faces suggests that they've just had a terrible row (as in rhymes with cow).These photos could end up being the visual equivalent of Derek's diaries - there are several boxes worth, including a number of letters. As usual, they were almost thrown in the skip. Many of the pictures are quite commonplace, but as I hope this selection has shown, even the most ordinary lives have something remarkable about them."},

The Victorian albums can be sold, but the rest usually end up in the bin, so I like having the opportunity to give some of these images a new life on the internet.The following photos all come from an album that begins in 1940 and covers a period of roughly 20 years. As you will see, it is possible to construct some sort of loose narrative from the images:1940. Judging by the trees in the background, this picture was taken either around the time or after the \"miracle\" of Dunkirk. As you can see, the British Army has been reduced to a ramshackle unit of ten soldiers, using equipment from World War One. In spite of this, the morale appears to have been high.1942 and the Army is in a much stronger position, with smart new uniforms and modern weapons.

During their days in Nigeria, Ghana and Malaysia, they enjoyed huge houses with servants, fine weather and exotic locations. In Britain, the best they could hope for was a cramped suburban semi.When the \"Wind of Change\" bought a swift end to the British Empire, these people must have returned home with heavy hearts."},

{"title": "A Climate For Living", "date": "Saturday, February 12, 2011", "text": "In my recent post about a 1960s book on urban design, I concluded that I was \"more than happy to live in a slightly chaotic hotch-potch of  medieval, Tudor, Georgian and Victorian buildings, rather than some  drab, functionalist vision of efficient living.\"But what exactly did this mean? What was it about Lewes that I felt made it successful as an urban environment?Yesterday afternoon, I decided to go looking for evidence. Rather than deliberately seeking out the most attractive parts of the town, I set myself the task of seeing what I could find within a 10-minute walk from my front door, taking photos of anything that caught my eye.Later, looking at the pictures I'd taken, I started thinking about the common themes that had emerged during my walk and ended up with a list of seven. That number rang a bell. Then I remembered that John Ruskin had written his 'Seven Lamps of Architecture' in the 1840s.My list is probably more of a 'Seven Low Energy Light Bulbs of Architecture', but these are the factors that I think are crucial to successful urban living:1. The Relationship with Nature:There are very few places in Lewes where you can't see the Downs. They place a natural limit to the town's growth and are a constant reminder of the natural landscape that exists beyond the urban one:Also, within the town itself, there are plenty of trees and green spaces open to the public and nobody is more than five minutes' walk away from a park or playing field. This is absolutely crucial to a successful urban environent.Obviously this relationship with nature has to be negotiated in many  different ways, depending on the local area. But anywhere can be  turned green. Look at the popularity of a recent project in New York,  where a disused elevated railway line has been tuned into a 2km-long  park.In some urban settings, it looks as if the area has been sprayed with Agent Orange. In Lewes, the natural and artificial seem to have reached a truce:2. Landmarks:Whilst all towns have to evolve over time to meet the needs of their inhabitants, it is vital to have some buildings that evoke a sense of permanence, existing beyond the reach of corporate greed or bureaucratic short-sightedness.In Lewes, the most obvious landmark is the 12th century Norman castle, which towers above the town:The castle almost sits in judgement upon the town, reminding us of our relationship with past and future generations.But not everywhere has the luxury of an inherited landmark, so in a newer town, it is vital that there are a few publically-owned prestige buildings.In Crawley, a new town in Sussex, almost the entire centre is given over to retail property. The only prominent public building, the library, is on the fringes of the town centre, on the wrong side of a busy road. The result is a soulless, depressing environment.3. A Mixture of Styles:Walk through the medieval archway of Lewes Castle and you will pass a succession of buildings from different periods, from the Georgian house above to these 21st-century homes:Uniformity can be a good thing - few would complain about Baron Haussmann's Paris - but the ecclectic mixture of buildings from different periods works particularly well in Lewes. This is a community that has evolved over time, in response to the needs of its inhabitants. I like the individuality and eccentricity of the local houses:4. Pedestrian Access:Lewes has a number of hidden alleyways known as 'twittens' (derived from betwixt and between), which cut across the town, making it easy for people to reach places on foot without having to cross a succession of busy roads:A network of footpaths, away from the main roads, is vital to the success of any urban landscape (I'm obviously assuming an absence of excrement, graffiti and muggers).5. Use of Local Materials:Everywhere you look in Lewes, you'll see evidence of the local Sussex flint, which has been quarried since Neolithic times:One of the attractive things about older buildings is their use of the local stone, giving a town or city a distinct identity, whether it's the beautiful Bath Stone or 'Granite City' of Aberdeen. Some of the most successful modern buildings of recent years have managed to acknowledge this heritage without betraying their contemporary origins.6. Good Local Authority Housing:These well-built council flats, which look down on the row of Edwardian houses, blend in well with the townscape and don't suffer from the same degree of ghettoisation that happens with larger, badly-designed estates. The contrast between the haves and have-nots isn't as marked as it is in London suburbs like Clapham.7. Civic PrideYou could almost walk past this simple flower pot, placed outside a house next to a public footpath, without noticing it:However, it tells us two very important things about Lewes. First, that it is possible to leave a pot outside your house without fear of theft or vandalism. Second, that someone has made an effort to provide some colour for the benefit of passers-by.The success of any community is perhaps the cumulative result of these small gestures of fellowship, from something as simple as someone bothering to polish their brass door knocker, to the local litter pick, where volunteers clean-up pathways and parks.Obviously I'm only a layman and this Lewes-centric argument probably falls apart when applied to other towns. If I lived in Amsterdam or Venice, I'd probably be recommending more water. If I was in Santa Barbara, I might say that money was the answer.But whilst my crude generalisations may not be up to Ruskin's standards, I think they contain a kernel of truth.I realise that Lewes itself might not be everyone's cup of tea - a little too twee and English, perhaps. But the key elements that make it work as a town can, I suspect, also be found in other successful towns the world over."},

{"title": "Health and Efficiency*", "date": "Wednesday, February 09, 2011", "text": "\"Tradition is a barrier to progress. The massive complexity of a town embraces techniques and ideas which extend over hundreds of years and whose rate of change is necessarily slow. We are all locked in this matrix of living and have to accept the conditions of life and work that others have created.\"These opening lines begin Anthony Tucker's 1967 book \"Climate For Living\", which I came across last week. At first glance, the book looks like a rather dull survey of postwar town planning.However, it soon becomes clear that this 64-page paperback is an uncompromising Modernist manifesto, giving a fascinating glimpse into the mindset of those architects and town planners who believed that social engineering was part of their remit.Tucker's use of images is highly selective, contrasting the filth and squalor of traditional urban environments, with the bright, clean, \"healthy\" environment of the new townscapes:There is also an alarming overuse of the word \"efficiency\", which always sets my alarm bells ringing. Efficient for whom?Here are some of the illustrations, with the author's original captions:\"Modern flats can blend with industry\"\"Artist's impression of street scene in new town\" \"Windowless instrument factory in Felixstowe\"\"A central computer could serve the new town\" \"Microwave cookers provide quick meals\" \"Austrian glasshouse tower for continuous production of lettuce\" What a depressing world to live in: windowless workplaces, concrete landscapes and microwave meals accompanied by tasteless, mass-produced lettuce. It's hard to believe that anyone could have been naive enough to think that this was really progress, but at the time I suppose many people shared the conviction that modern, urban planning would liberate the masses from the squalor and discomfort of the past.In fairness to the author, he does later acknowledge that:\"Tradition may always be a barrier to progress, but it may also contain elements of great importance obscured by a clutter of obvious obsolescence. The problem lies in teasing these factors out so that they can be properly assessed, and then using new techniques in such a way that they are taken into account.The upsurge of architectural and engineering optimism of thirty years ago died in its own cold wilderness of concrete because its eyes were on structural possibility, not human requirements.Planners and engineers are now concerned first and foremost with the creation of environments that are sympathetic to human needs...\"Ironically, it is the original Modernist buildings, built between the wars, that have proved to be more enduring than the townscapes heralded by Anthony Tucker. What does that tell us? Perhaps simply that good design is what really counts, not a utilitarian social agenda, however well-intentioned.Today, the urban landscapes celebrated in \"Climate For Living\" feature prominently in books and websites like \"Crap Towns\" and Between Channels and are almost universally derided. We know just how quickly the \"cities in the sky\" became sink estates, with broken lifts, graffiti and urine-soaked stairwells. It's amazing to think that half a century ago, this all looked like a good idea.As for being \"locked in a matrix of living...that others have created\", I'm more than happy to live in a slightly chaotic hotch-potch of medieval, Tudor, Georgian and Victorian buildings, rather than some drab, functionalist vision of efficient living.That's probably very inefficient of me.*Apologies to anyone who hoped that this post was about naturism."},

Apparently he was the author of 'Berlin Alexanderplatz', which some people may remember from the Fassbinder television adaptation.The second book doesn't have such an attractive cover design:But the author photo on the back of the dustjacket is superb:She's no Iris Murdoch, in any sense.Published in 1963, this novel looks as if it would appeal to anyone who has enjoyed 'Mad Men'.According to the jacket blurb:'The  author had just turned thirty and divorced her second husband when she  wrote this astonishing first novel - a daring story of a single woman's  frantic search for love in a loose-living, free-wheeling world.'It looks quite a lively read. I like the first line:'After my marriage broke up, I went haywire.' Short and to the point.Further down the first page, the narrator writes:'Two things were very appealing to men, I discovered. One was a recently divorced woman and the other was a complete bitch, and to my surprise I woke up one day and realised I was both, so I had no trouble at all.'Steamy stuff. A lot more exciting than the book I'm dealing with at the moment: 'The World of Nitrogen' by Isaac Asimov.Full credit to Asimov for spotting that gap in the market - books exclusively about nitrogen - and with cocaine, nitroglycerine and nylon all owing their existence to this element, it's more interesting than you might think.But only just."},

{"title": "The Origins of Derek - Part Two", "date": "Sunday, January 30, 2011", "text": "If you're new to this blog, click here to understand the background to this post. If you don't have time to do that, the short answer is that these are extracts from the diaries of a civil servant called Derek.25th April, 1955  'This is my first journal. I am keeping it so that I may have a durable record of my thoughts, experiences and views, to read when I am wrinkled and grey and full of years.  I am a student at a technical college, where I am studying for a General Certificate of Education. My age is twenty-two. Since 1952 I had been recovering from Pott's Disease, which is tuberculosis of the spine. Rather than that I should sit around idle, I have been encouraged to get on with my education.'If I'd had the good sense to read Derek's diaries in chronological order, I would have realised why he was such a hypochondriac, panicking at the slightest twinge of pain or palpitation of the heart. Being struck down with such a debilitating illness at the age of 19 must have been the defining moment in Derek's life.In a footnote written in the 1980s, Derek writes that:'Because of ill health, I was not able to work for four years; and they were prime years; and the result was a feeling of worthlessness - as though there were no place for me.' What sort of person would Derek have become if he hadn't contracted Pott's disease? Would he have still married Brenda? Would he have become a Mormon? 'During the dinner-hour, we (the students) sat on the lawn and talked of God. They were quite surprised to discover that I am a \"Mormon\". (N.B. I joined the church in July 1954) Lorraine wanted to know how many wives I had. Uninformed girl! She also stated that she believed the New Testament but not the Old. How can people worship half a God?  To accept God is peace of mind, but to accept biology only leads to wondering and the more one wonders, the more sleep one loses. Someday God will speak to all men in a voice that cannot be denied, and them the edifice of Darwinism will crumble to the ground, and become dust beneath the feet of truth. I hope I'm there to see it. My gosh - I do sound intolerant.'But one of the most appealing things about Derek is his intellectual curiosity. He was a voracious reader and an obsessive collector of secondhand books, covering a wide spectrum of subjects. It is to Derek's credit that he didn't try to maintain his religious faith by closing his mind to other ideas.28th April 1955'Introspection is a dangerous habit when indulged in daily. It saps one's spiritual strength, weakens one's will and turns one into a cynic. It is the mark of a lonely man and springs from fear. The introspective man needs to be loved day by day, year by year; but first he must find someone to love and understand him. Fortunately I have Brenda, but how strong is she? How long can I expect her to bear my moods and selfishness with patience?' Tuesday May 10th 1955  'Brenda has promised me a kiss.'  Friday May 13th, 1955'I phoned Brenda tonight. We are passing through one of our peaceful periods when passions rest and harmony prevails. This morning, while she was ironing, she looked at the calendar and said \"Ha! Ha! - Friday the thirteenth! Wonder what will happen today?\"  She then turned back to her ironing and found that she had scorched her best jumper.' Saturday May 14th, 1955'I am full of hatred: for myself, for my fellows, for everything. And why? Because there is something lacking in my make-up. I have no hope for myself.  Poor Brenda! Why can't you leave me alone that I might utterly destroy myself? Why can't you realise that I am mad? Your love is wasted and it can only bring you sorrow. I know myself too well to give you any hope. All I want to do is dissolve and become nothing.'Thursday May 26th, 1955  'I rose late and went to cast my vote at the General Election. Later, I took Brenda to a concert at the Town Hall. Horror of horrors! We were a week early. We hid our chagrin and went to the News Theatre to watch some cartoons. While we were in there, we ate a bag of bacon sandwiches; so, strangely enough, did the young couple sitting next to us.After the show, we went and sat under a tree in the churchyard and quarelled. I was in one of my awkward moods: Brenda would not let me kiss her because she had a cold. I shouted at her. Then we were both silent.  After a while I apologized and we went to \"Ernies\", a very ritzy restaurant. We had a mixed grill and I explained the \"celestial order\" to her.  We then left \"Ernies\" and went back to the churchyard and did a little hugging. Then we parted. We shall not be seeing each other for a week.'  Monday May 30th, 1955  'At last I have finished reading the book on flying saucers I borrowed from the chapel library. The conclusion the author arrives at is: the saucers come from Mars, they are manned by insects - possibly bees which have been found to be capable of communicating with each other - hypothetically a mark of intelligence; they come to earth beacuse they fear that we will start a chain reaction with one of our atom bombs that will blow the earth to dust and, thus, fill the atmosphere with a dense cloud of particles that will shut off the precious though small amount of sunshine that Mars receives.  By studying us, the bees hope to gauge their chances of survival by us not setting off an atom bomb.  The bees are supposed to build their machines by bending quartz crystals, which thus generate electricity and grow larger if fed upon quartz powder. The whole book is a fascinating hypothesis. I enjoyed it; and might add: \"What is in the realm of imagination is within the realm of possibility.\"'  Thursday 23rd June, 1955  'This afternoon I met Brenda in town and we then invaded a hairdressing salon, whose entrance is situated in a dingy cellar. Brenda trotted up some well-carpeted stairs and entered an office to complain about the way her hair was done. Of course there were protests.  \"But, madam, Mr Jacquis comes from London.\"'\"So do I,\" responded Brenda.  And so Cockney wit won the day and the \"man from London\" has promised to do Brenda's hair again..It is a strange experience reading Derek's first diary. Many of the familiar elements are there: the irrelevant anecdotes, millenarist allusions and moments of self-doubt. But this is a young man's journal - more passionate and less Pooterish than the middle-aged Derek.Derek is rather hazy about about what he wants from the future, but he is quite certain that he wants to marry Brenda, even if their courtship appears to have been a rocky one at times.Two years later, Derek gets his girl and it is heartbreaking to contrast the optimism and hope of the young married couple with the diaries from the 1980s, when Derek and Brenda's relationship appears to have been ground down by ill fortune and difficult circumstances.But it is easy to be positive and optimistic when you are 22, and aren't weighed down by the ballast of wrong decisions, squandered opportunities and plain bad luck. The real challenge comes later, when you are faced with the choice between descending into bitterness and self-pity, or making the best out of what life has dealt you.Derek clearly picked the latter path, finding fulfillment in the simple pleasures of the home and the fellowship of his local Mormon church. When adversity struck, his saving grace was a sense of humour and, probably, a fatalistic belief that all events were part of a divine plan.Perhaps Derek was right.By now, his diaries should be decomposing on a landfill site. Instead, Derek now enjoys a worldwide audience.Derek would cite divine intervention, but I want to know more about those Martian bees first."},
{"title": "Everything Must Go", "date": "Wednesday, January 26, 2011", "text": "Warning! Unless you're particularly interested in the book trade, this is a long, dull post. If you are particularly interested in the book trade, then you probably already know this...I remember visiting the first UK branch of Borders, back in the late 90s and thinking that I had seen the future.Compared to the average Waterstone's, it was bright and airy, with an exciting range of products (I was particularly impressed by the listening posts for CDs). The buzzword in those days was \"lifestyle\" and the whole ethos of Borders was to create a place where people could \"hang out\", meeting friends for a coffee, going to a poetry reading or listening to the latest World Music CDs.A bit like being in an episode of \"Friends\".Like most people, I had no idea that I was watching a firework in its final stage, releasing one last spectacular volley of flares. The new Borders store turned out to be one of the last examples of a type of retailing - large stores with huge stockholdings - that would shortly become an anachronism. Once broadband was introduced, internet shopping quickly reached the tipping point and those lovely CD listening posts suddenly seemed ridiculously antiquated.I was completely wrong about Borders, but I was right about the internet. In 1997, during a drink with a senior figure in Ottakar's (not James Heneage, I hasten to add), I said that it was imperative that we launched an internet site as quickly as possible. He snorted and took great delight in telling me that only 1.5% of the population shopped online and that the figure would only change slowly over time, as most people still weren't comfortable with computers. I wish we'd bet money on it.Over a decade later, the book chains all appear to be on the brink of collapse. In the USA, Borders are about to go bankrupt and whilst some commentators have blamed years of mismanagement, the truth is that they have merely accelerated the chain's inevitable demise.Barnes and Noble had a strong management team and embraced the digital age, but it still wasn't enough. Recently Leonard Riggio, the founder of Barnes and Noble, joked \"Sometimes I want to shoot myself in the morning.\"On this side of the Atlantic, British Bookshops have just gone bust and the management team of Waterstone's have been congratulating themselves for only losing 0.4% in last year's like for like sales.Given the overall decline in high street sales, -0.4% looks quite promising - certainly much better than its ailing parent company, HMV. But considering that Borders UK ceased trading at the beginning of 2010, it's a pretty dismal result. Waterstone's should have grabbed enough of the Borders market share to come up with some positive figures.Now that Waterstone's is the last man standing out of the high street bookselling chains, it can only survive by closing its loss-making stores (of which there are a growing number). 20 have already been ear-marked, but I suspect this is only the tip of the iceberg (particularly if HMV are forced to sell the chain).Nice poster, shame about the dumbed-down text. And where are the books?It's not all bad news for Waterstone's. They still have a significant share of the UK market and there is a core of thriving, profitable stores that have many years left in them if they can free themselves from the shackles of HMV and return to their roots. But overall, I can't help feeling that the age of the chain booksellers was just a brief interlude in the long history of bookselling.In an article I read recently, someone neatly summed-up the problems facing the bookseller:The Seven Deadly Paradoxes of Bookselling:  1. The better the bookseller and the more representative their stock, the less chance they have of selling it.  2. The harder a book is to sell, the smaller is their reward for selling it.  3. (The converse, which is more deadly than it first appears.) The easier the book to sell, the greater the reward.  4. The sooner they sell their stock, the longer they must wait before they can replace it on the same terms.5. In buying the season's new books for stock they must recognize at sight and sometimes at the sight of the jacket only - the merits of their contents.  6. Readers are increasing; purchases are dwindling.7. The window is their most valuable, and almost their only, advertisement; to  be effective it must be in the main part of the town. Few can afford  that position.You may be surprised to learn that these words were written 75 years ago, by Basil Blackwell in a title called \"The Book World - a New Survey\". Conditions may have changed since 1935 (in Blackwell's day, the enemy was the public library), but the basic principles are the same: sales can rise or fall; rents only go up.Until recently, it looked as if it was a straightforward battle, with the high street chains losing a war of attrition against the supermarkets and internet booksellers. But just as we were adjusting to the new bookselling landscape, the Kindle suddenly appeared on the scene, shortly followed by the Sony e-Reader.A couple of years ago I was congratulating myself for swapping high street bookselling for the internet. Little did I know how soon the goalposts were going to move again.Keen to reduce their warehousing costs and stay one step ahead of the competition, Amazon have been aggressively promoting the Kindle. When e-books started to appear on Amazon's bestseller charts, they were accused of manipulating the figures to stimulate demand. But according to Jeff Bezos, millions of people now own Kindles and the demand is growing by the day, with Amazon selling around three in every four e-books.In the UK alone, it is estimated that several hundred thousand people received Kindles for Christmas, so the tipping point has definitely been reached, but where does that leave the rest of the book trade?This post is all ready far too long, so I'll be brief. Here are, in my opinion, the main issues facing the book trade today:The decline of the high street chains will be accelerated by the advent of the e-book. However not all book formats lend themselves to the Kindle, or even the i-Pad. Children's books will contiue to thrive on the printed page, particularly books for young children. Paperback sales will dip sharply, but there will still be a market for titles with high production values. Bricks and mortar booksellers who can adapt to these niche markets stand more chance of surviving.If the high street chains collapse, then publishers will find it increasingly harder to develop and promote the next generation of authors. Fewer titles will be published and first-time novelists will struggle more than ever.Amazon are taking a risk with the Kindle. If the encoding of  e-books is cracked, they could be downloaded and shared as easily as MP3s. If that happens, then publishers, agents, booksellers and authors will see a substantial loss of income.With the advent of the i-Pad and its inevitable imitators, why would anyone want to buy a device that only reads books?Where will it all end? Basil Blackwell saw difficult times ahead in 1935, but the Penguin paperback made reading more popular than ever. I suppose that ultimately, what matters is not where we get our books, or what format they're in, but the fact that we read.BREAKING NEWS...   In the three days since I posted this, Borders are trying to negotiate a $500,000,000 refinacing package and Amazon have announced that Kindle sales are now only 20% lower than their paperback sales. Also Waterstone's have asked publishers to reduce scale-down the new title orders and their head of e-commerce has resigned."},
{"title": "January's Bookmarks", "date": "Tuesday, January 25, 2011", "text": "This month has been a fairly poor one, as far as work is concerned. Most  of my stock has come from a library clearance sale and the gems appear  to have been weeded-out. However, a few  curious photographs have  managed to slip through the net.This  wonderful street scene is from the turn of the last century, but you'll  have to click on the image to fully appreciate it. When I first saw the  photo, it looked unsettlingly familiar, then I discovered that it was  of Station Road, Hampton, near where I grew up.Most  of the buildings in Teddington and Hampton sprang up in the 1880s and  90s, during the huge expansion of the London suburbs. Today, the   streets look remarkably unchanged, with long rows of Victorian  semi-detached houses. The few 20th century buildings were generally  built to fill the gaps left by the Luftwaffe.Here's another town that has changed very little:On the reverse of the postcard, which has a postmark dated 4PM - SP 7 - 09, I found some more information about \"Mrs Wakefield\":I think I might incorporate the naughty Mrs Wakefield into my five-year-old son's bedtime story routine.This gentleman appears to be wearing a large flower in his buttonhole. Is he off to a wedding?I'd also like to know more about the next two photos. Is it the same man in both pictures?At  first glance, I'd say they were different men, but it's amazing what a  receding hairline and a luxuriant moustache can do to add a certain gravitas. Fighting in the First World War probably added a few years too.Assuming  that the photographer is her husband (or boyfriend), this photograph is  curiously touching. My mother would probably say something about  \"mutton dressed up as lamb\", but I like that fact that the woman seems  at ease with herself and is having fun.My  father used to do of cycling and youth hostelling in his 20s and was  always telling me what fun it was, but there must be easier ways to get  girls into bed.Two notable worthies, these photos were found in a crumbling, leather double frame. Sadly there were no clues to their identity.Finally, my favourite book from last week:Ideal gift? For who? Presumably someone you dislike, as I can't think of a more depressing present.The  title doesn't help. Why can't it be \"Enjoying Retirement\", with the  gentleman on the front happily pruning some roses or playing with a  train set?On the other hand, given the grim economic forecasts for the  pensions industry, perhaps those Saga   catalogues that feature white-haired people enjoying exotic cruises and  exhausting multi-city intineraries, will soon be a thing of the past."},
{"title": "The Origins of Derek - Part One", "date": "Saturday, January 22, 2011", "text": "About a year ago, a strange consignment of books turned up at work, stored in a large cage - the type that Hannibal Lecter was incarcerated in during the opening scenes of 'Silence of the Lambs'. Within the hour, someone from the warehouse marched up to my desk and told me that I needed to sort through the stock that day or else it would be thrown away.I don't like going down to the warehouse. My workplace is like H.G. Wells' 'Time Machine', with the Eloi working in comfortable, air conditioned offices, whilst the Morlocks occupy a noisy, dark, subterranean complex, full of large machines. I feel guilty that I have a comfortable swivel chair and can come and go as I please without clocking in, but the survival instinct is even stronger.I promptly donned a hi-vis jacket and made sure that I was armed with a bright light (flaming torches set off the smoke alarms).The selection of books ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous. There were many historical and literary titles in immaculate condition, but also a number of bizarre books published by small presses, most of which asserted that the Earth was only a few thousand years old. One claimed to have conclusive evidence that humans and dinosaurs co-existed.At the time, I had no idea that I was looking at Derek's book collection.I wish I'd had more time to peruse Derek's library, but we were under pressure to clear the space as quickly as possible and had to make snap decisions about what to keep. Towards the bottom of the cage, someone found a box full of foolscap folders and called me over to have a look. To my amazement, there were thousands of pages of typed and handwritten A4 sheets, plus a few exercise books - a diary of someone's entire adult life, spanning a period from the early 1950s through to the 1990s.\"Chuck it?\" I was asked. Horrified, I shook my head and said that I needed to know more about the contents. They were sent up to a storage are in the warehouse, where I thought that the diaries would be safe, but a few hours later I noticed that a box was missing. I quickly moved the remains and took them to my office.Later, during a quiet moment, I started to read the contents and realised that I had found something wonderful. But what should I do with Derek's diaries? Simply keeping them wasn't much better then throwing them away. These diaries were written to be read.In my last entry, I wrote about the moral dilemmas of blogging and in the case of Derek's diaries, I have often wondered about the ethics of publishing someone's private papers. However, I feel quite certain that faced with a choice between seeing his life's work pulped or having extracts published on the internet, Derek would have chosen the latter.But rather than speculate, let's hear from Derek himself. In 1980, he typed up his first journal from 1955, adding footnotes and this telling preface:\"My early journals, and the later one some people might declare, make me squirm when I read them now. They are full of self-pity, mawkish sentiment, selfish opinions, and abysmal writing. Were it not that I truly believe that \"the child is the father of the man\", in that the person I am now is a sort on omnibus composed of many pieces bought forward from that stumbling past, I would confine those journals to the fire without any compunction. But we all of us like to brood upon beginnings, seeds sown, passions formed, the foundations of character and personality, and I am no exception to that rule.When I am going through a period of self-examination, especially my faults, I strive to trace what I find within my inner depths to original seeds. This is profitable in conveying lessons to others. Knowledge by experience is of far more value than any wisdom gained from books. So, though my journals are full of many weaknesses, perhaps there are unobserved lessons in them that will help others, particularly my posterity in the days that lie ahead.\"Posterity is a word that Derek uses frequently, but it isn't a reference to a nebulous collection of people in the future. For Derek, posterity means his descendants:\"As to that posterity, I hope they will not think me the worst of their ancestors. I am arrogant; but I see my arrogance and am always quickly repentant of it. I am foolish, too. By this I mean that I have a sense of humour that often gets out of hand and manifests itself in stupid speeches and foolish remarks, many of the out of place. On occasion I also play practical jokes, many of them of a literary ilk. At the same time it is a sense of humour that has enabled me to pass through many dark places and to observe the desparate side of funny situations.If any legend goes down to my posterity concerning the man I was, it may well be the fact that I loved to collect books, even to the detriment of the welfare of my family on occasion. At the present time I have about four thousand volumes about me; I cannot pass a bookshop without pausing to browse.\"I'm glad that Derek never knew that his 'posterity' would one day consign his diaries and the beloved book collection to oblivion."},

Compare the poetry of \"For now we see through a glass, darkly\" to the  functional prose of the Good News Bible's \"What we see now is like a dim image in a mirror\".Obviously there are sound theological reasons why new versions of the Bible are printed, but from a literary point of view they are usually disappointing. I'd like to see a Seamus Heaney version.By coincidence, later that day, the BBC website published this fascinating article on the King James Version of the Bible and how it has endured to the present day.

Last September I ran out of money and got to the stage where I was emptying out jam jars of coins and rifling through the pockets of old jackets looking for cash, just so that I would be able to buy food. So when emails arrived offering me cash or free products if I wrote a promotional blog post, I was sorely tempted.However, I have always declined because a blog should always be about belief and passion, independent of any commercial agenda. Compromise that integrity and people will soon vote with their feet.Then, last week, temptation appeared in the form of a very reasonable email which offered a  small payment in return for a promotional post for a client. The email promised that I would have complete editorial freedom (although the client reserves the right not to publish) and that I should make it clear that the post was sponsored. It was a disarmingly clever email.I was about to delete the message, but curiosity got the better of me. Who was the client?When I discovered that it was the British Library, I couldn't believe my luck. I was expecting some sort of corporation. Instead, I was being asked to promote an exhibition that I would have gladly written about anyway.As far as I was concerned, the acid test would be whether I could say what I liked, so I wrote a post about business jargon, mentioning the exhibition at the end. I had decided that I wouldn't accept any editorial changes to the content and if the post was rejected, that was that.The post was accepted. No changes were required and I felt that my criteria were met, but nevertheless, I wonder if I have crossed a line? And where do we draw that line? Free books? Links to Amazon? Invitations to book launches? Promoting books by friends?If I ever want to see the money, I apparently have to write one or two more sponsored posts and I doubt if I'll ever be offered another client as squeaky clean as the British Library, so my brief flirtation with monetising may have been a bit of a flop. However, I enjoyed writing the post and really appreciated the range of comments, so it was worth doing."},
{"title": "English as a Foreign Language", "date": "Monday, January 17, 2011", "text": "British LibrarySponsored PostFive years ago, I was happily managing a branch of Ottakar's Bookstores in a sleepy coastal town in southern England. It wasn't the most exciting place to run a bookshop, but I worked with some lovely people and my employers were like-minded people who hated business jargon and viewed my personal quirks as an asset rather than a threat. A few months later, Ottakar's was bought by HMV, who owned the Waterstone's bookshop chain and, almost overnight, the culture of the business changed.What alarmed me most of all wasn't the changes in working practices or even the new restrictions on local autonomy, but the use of language. In Ottakar's, anyone who used jargon was ridiculed. In Waterstone's, good old-fashioned Anglo-Saxon words like old, new and closing down were replaced with legacy, conversion and exiting. When I had problems with a stock-management system that didn't really work, I was told that I needed to upskill.I quickly discovered that reflection was a bad thing. We needed to be continually going forward and it wasn't enough to just do things - we had to ensure that we were actioning them. However, if opportunities presented themselves, we were encouraged to take advantage of any easy wins. If we were presented with a rather challenging spreadsheet full of sales figures, we were encouraged to drill down and identify any issues. If there were issues that were beyond our control, we were encouraged to escalate them to a higher level. On the few occasions that anyone owned up to making a mistake, it was announced that learnings had been made. If I dared to make joke about this in meetings, I realised that I was surrounded by people with no sense of humour. I had to go.In general, I have found that people use jargon to either obfuscate the truth or make perfectly simple things seem terribly serious and important. Regimes like jargon. But if we're aware of our language and why it is in a constant state of flux, it is harder for the dictators to insist that their words belong to some long-established immutable truth. This is why I was delighted to accept an invitation from the British Library to do a sponsored post about a new exhibition called \"Evolving English\".Evolving English is a free exhibition which is open until April 3rd this year and includes the only surviving manuscript of \"Beowulf\", the Shakespeare Quartos, Dr Johnson's dictionary and a variety of examples of different uses of English, including early advertising campaigns, text messages, comics, children's recordings, web pages, lists of slang and examples of newspapers from around the world.There are also some wonderful dialect recordings, which I have already mentioned in this previous post. If you live too far away to visit the Evolving English exhibition, there are opportunities to join in online. First, there is this quiz, which isn't as easy as I thought. Second, you can participate in the Tweetosphere (you heard it here first) #evolvingenglish.If you are lucky enough to visit the exhibition, before April 3rd, you can actually become part of the collection by reading an extract from Mr Tickle. This will be kept as part of an archive to demonstrate what accents were like in 2010. I wish that a similar experiment could have been conducted 100 years ago, as I suspect that accents and word usage are in an even greater state of flux than we realise. I'm delighted that an exhibition like this is taking place, because as long as we are of what's happening to our language, we can stop others from misusing it.Share hosted by Wikio"},
{"title": "Act of Faith", "date": "Tuesday, January 11, 2011", "text": "Perhaps I'm being over-sensitive, but in general I avoid telling people that I write a blog. When I have told anyone, I feel very uncomfortable, as if I've just announced an interest in Dungeons and Dragons, or a penchant for Genesis.Most people I tell assume that I'm a frustrated writer, but nothing could be further from the truth. I have occasionally harboured musical ambitions but never literary ones, thanks to two decades of bookselling.When I joined the original Waterstone's (which was still run by Tim Waterstone) as a lowly bookseller, one of my jobs involved sitting in a dark cupboard, tearing up books. Most of these books were unsold first novels, which the publisher had deemed worthless. Rather than pay for the whole book to be returned, it was agreed that it would be more cost effective to just tear off the front covers and return them in a jiffy bag.I remember sitting on a kickstool, with a black bin liner between my legs, throwing away novels that had often taken years to write. Some of them looked very good, but for some indefinable reason - a lack of reviews, poor marketing or an off-putting blurb - the books hadn't sold.There was one particular new novel that I really liked. I had read a proof copy and expected the book to attract a lot of broadsheet reviews, but it was published almost by stealth and I don't remember selling a single copy. A few months later, the author committed suicide.Whenever I have a fleeting urge to start writing a book, I think of that dark cupboard and the thousands of unsold books I've returned to publishers over the years.I was reminded of this when, last week, we received a consignment of discontinued stock from Belfast's public libraries. Most of the books were popular novels published between the 1950s and 70s. It was like looking at a collection of books from a parallel universe. I didn't recognise a single name.Do any of these authors ring a bell?Vian SmithDave WallisJohn VerneyKathleen SullyGeorge ShipwayRobin WhiteDoreen WallaceFrederic WakemanDal StivensHerbert SimmonsJayne VineyJoyce PorterGerda RhoadsMalissa RedheadMarshall PughClare SimonJohn PollockSimon WaldronKatharine SimGrace PhippsI haven't come across modern editions of works by any of these writers and over half of them have no Wikipedia entries. It's as if they never existed.Seeing so many forgotten books could have been a depressing experience, but does every novel have to be written for posterity? In their time, these authors were rated highly enough to be published and enjoyed a wide readership, which is all any aspiring writer can hope for.Very few women read 'The Women's Room' these days and I doubt whether many will read 'Bridget Jones's Diary' in 20 years, but that doesn't diminish the impact these books had in their day.By the time I'd finished wading through box after box of obscure novels, I felt amazed, but also grateful, that people wrote and published books at all. It seemed an act of faith that flew in the face of reason, and we are all better for it."},
{"title": "Between the Wars", "date": "Saturday, January 08, 2011", "text": "Here is a completely random selection of things that caught my eye at work last week. There isn't any particular theme linking these items, except that they all come from period between Armistice Day and the end of the Second World War.This photo was found in a 1939 Barbara Cartland novel. These days, the Iron Cross inspires a reaction similar to the swastika, but we mustn't forget that once it was merely an innocent symbol of Prussian militarism.This beautiful bookplate comes from a huge collection of novels that once belonged to Belfast's public libraries. I hadn't heard of most of the books. Indeed, when I first opened the box, it looked as if the contents had come from a parallel universe (I shall have to write a blog post on these titles).Libraries are, of course, very much in the news at the moment, thanks to the Government's spending review. Everyone likes libraries, even if we don't always use them. Libraries are the hallmark of a civilised society, so why are they being threatened with such drastic cuts?I has assumed that public libraries were very expensive to maintain, but not so, argues Joanna Trollope in yesterday's Guardian newspaper. Her local county council's libraries account for a mere 1.45% of the annual budget, but in spite of this, they are still being cut by more than 50%.Andrew Carnegie must be turning in his grave.Another attractive bookplate. I like the idea of the Seafarers Education Association and can imagine lots of sailors puffing away at their pipes, being lectured on the finer points of Renaissance art.There isn't much to say about this, except that it has a very attractive typeface, particularly the big As and Os.This photo fell out of a copy of \"The Hound of Death\" by James Barlow.I found this striking colour plate by Dodo Adler in a 1940s book called \"Fairy Tales from the Balkans\". Surprisingly, the book isn't even worth a tenner.I had no idea where this is, but I guessed that it would be somewhere like Torquay and typed the name into Google images. Three seconds later, my theory was confirmed with this photo of modern-day Torquay:If you're not from the UK and haven't heard of Torquay, it is part of the \"English Riviera\" (not quite an oxymoron, but it certainly doesn't have the same ring as French Riviera) and was the setting for Fawlty Towers. A lot of people retire there.The picture of the harbour comes from a 1920s album of photographs that feature people enjoying themselves in Torquay and Dartmoor.The album doesn't have many images that are worth posting, but I quite like this:I would love to know who these people were and what their connection was. The other photos feature games of tennis, trips to Dartmoor and clifftop walks. It all looks very appealing.The album also includes this picture, from the days when the Royal Navy was the largest in the world:Today, this probably is the Royal Navy. But there's more to life than ruling the waves."},
{"title": "Attack of the Space Hermaphrodites", "date": "Friday, January 07, 2011", "text": "Last week I discovered this wonderful website, dedicated to some of the worst films ever made. I had no idea that there were films called Attack of the Giant Leeches or Mars Needs Women, so I decided to try a couple and see just how dreadful they were.The first movie I watched was a 1960s Italian science fiction film called I Criminali della Galassia (Criminals of the Galaxy), which was dubbed into English and released as Wild Wild Planet.Frankly, the phrase \"1960s Italian science fiction\" is more than enough to make me want to watch a film, particularly given that the Anglo-American vision of the future is often so dull.Would you really want to live in the dreary, politically correct universe of Captain Jean-Luc Picard or 2001: A Space Odyssey, when there are alternatives like this:I've no idea what this movie is about. Admittedly I'd had a couple a drinks when I watched Wild Wild Planet, but even if I'd been stone cold sober with a can of Red Bull and Mark Kermode sitting next to me, I'd be none the wiser. It's an utterly mad film.From what I could glean, Wild Wild Planet is about a series of kidnappings committed by attractive young women who are assisted by bald hermaphrodites in black leather coats and dark glasses. The victims are instantly shrunk to a fifth of their normal size so that they can be conveniently transported in a suitcase. They are then taken to another planet, where a mad scientist restores the victims to their normal size, then grafts them onto the body of someone of the opposite sex to create a new, super-race.This scene gives you the gist of it:As you can see, the special effects are in a class of their own. I rather like the fashions, particularly the fascisti black coats and dark glasses. Who says bald men aren't sexy?There are many reasons for watching films like Wild Wild Planet, but what particularly appeals to me is how much it tells you about the zeitgeist of mid-1960s Italy. This film is the product of an age in which Modernism was still in the ascendancy and people genuinely believed that they were on the brink of a Space Age.Like most popular science fiction films, the Wild Wild Planet's vision of the future is always an über-present, rather than a bold, radically different vision of society; so it's mini skirts a go-go and lots of patronising men.It's strange how bad films can be so depressing when they're contemporary, but enjoyable when they're a few decades old. I suppose it's because we know that these films are just aberrations, rather than harbingers of the end of Western civilisation.Wild Wild Planet may be a dreadful movie, but it looks comparatively sensible compared to this absurd film:I don't know where to begin with Zeta One. It is possibly the worst British film ever made and it comes as no surprise to learn that the director Michael Cort didn't work again.There are two excellent articles (here and here) that give a summary of the plot, which appears to involve a battle between topless women from another planet and James Robertson Justice (aided by Charles Hawtrey).There is also a secret agent called James Word, whose role never seems to be clearly defined. However, he seems to be enjoying himself:The climax of Zeta One involves a battle between the topless warriors and a group of Scottish gamekeepers. This must be one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen:What does Zeta One tell us about 1969? First, that it was possible to conceive and produce a film as ridiculous as this without being sectioned under the 1963 Mental Health Act. Second, that in the wake of the famous Lady Chatterley trial, our popular culture was obsessed with sex.This strange brand of titillating sauciness continued right through the 70s, with plenty of superfluous nudity in films, book covers and record sleeves.Then, of course, in the early 80s, it all changed. The advent of the VCR meant that titillation was replaced by genuine pornography. Also, when AIDS first entered the public consciousness with photos of the dying Rock Hudson, sexual promiscuity no longer seemed so appealing.The final nail in the coffin was probably the \"New Conservatism\" of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.It has been said that if you really want to capture the flavour of a particular period, a second-rate crime novel is far better than a classic. I'm not sure if the same rule always applies to films (is Zeta One more authentically 60s than Alfie?).I think I'll have to do some more research."},
{"title": "Originality", "date": "Tuesday, January 04, 2011", "text": "One of the best selling humour titles of the last decade has been Ricky Gervais's Flanimals  series. I've never quite seen the appeal of these books and when I was  first shown a rough copy by the publisher, I was convinced that it would  be a flop.How wrong I was.Flanimals  is now being turned into a $50,000,000 Hollywood film, with Gervais as  the star and the books are a permanent stock item in every humour  section. But last summer, the whole franchise was threatened by a High  Court writ.The writ was issued by John Savage, a self-published  author, who believes that Flanimals was plagiarised from a book that  he'd published four years earlier, called \"Captain Pottie’s Wildlife Encyclopaedia\".Here is an example from John Savage's book:And here's a page from Flanimals:Is this evidence of plagiarism, or two individuals thinking along parallel lines?John Savage is convinced that it's the former and in addition to receiving damages for \"significant financial hardship and loss\", he also wants every remaining book in the Flanimals  series to be pulped - a rather draconian measure.Ricky Gervais claims that the books date  back to his teenage years, when he drew imaginary creatures to entertain  his nephew.Accusations of plagiarism aren't uncommon (as J.K.Rowling will testify).  Some of the litigants are chancers trying their luck; a few are barking  mad (a friend of mine who worked at Book Trust regularly received angry  letters from a man who was certain that he was the author of Jonathan  Coe's \"What a Carve Up!\"), whilst others are genuinely convinced that  their ideas have been stolen.I've no idea what category John  Savage falls into, but the similarities between Captain Pootie and  Flanimals can't be completely dismissed.But wait! I have another piece of evidence, which I found a few days ago:This is \"Animal Land\", which was published in New York by Dutton in 1897. I found this book a few days ago and as soon as I opened it, I was struck by its remarkable similarities with Flanimals.Here are some examples:It's uncanny.Animal Land was conceived by the four-year-old Sybil Corbet, with  illustrations by her mother, Katherine. There is also a hilarious  introduction by the Scots literary critic Andrew Lang, which is written in a deliberately po-faced style, as if he is presenting a work of serious scholarship:\"Our author owes nothing, I conceive,  to her literary predecessors. If she follows any one it is Mr Lear, the  creator of the Quangle wangle and of the Yonghi Bonghi Bo. On the habits  of these creatures, especially on the sources of their food supply, Mr  Lear says little. But it is obvious that the nutriment of the fauna of  her fancy preoccupies our author...\"The discovery of this long-forgotten book changes everything. Whilst  it's entirely possible that Ricky Gervaise and/or John Savage might have  plagiarised this obscure Victorian title, I'm more inclined to think  that Animal Land clearly shows that there are a lot of people out there who are amused by imaginary creatures.I remember my oldest son making up Pokemon characters when he was four  or five, dictating long passages to me that made no sense at all: \"This is Mitibar. He has keemoes and cheepas and fires wellumseems...\" It's not just Messrs Savage and Gervais who have a fertile imagination.The discovery of Animal Land  has made me realise just what a minefield the whole issue of copyright  and intellectual property is. How do we know whether an idea is original  or not? And in the case of Joanna Rowling, is it reasonable to expect  her to write the Harry Potter books without betraying any influence of  the hundreds of stories she devoured as a young girl? We can point out  the similarities between Rowling's Platform 9 and 3/4 and Eva Ibbotson's \"Secret of Platform 13\", but is this plagiarism or simply being influenced?I'm pretty sure that Harry Hill pinched a joke from me,  but I don't think for one minute that it was intentional. Our ideas are  the sum total of everything we experience and it's all to easy for  experiences to sink down into the murky depths of the subconscious, only  to reappear in the fraudulent guise of an original thought. We are also  the product of a culture and we shouldn't be too surprised when two  people come up with the same idea.Having said that, I'm completely baffled by the popularity of any book  that features made-up animals. Where's the joke? Anyone can make up a  creature with a silly name that likes eating something improbable like  tarpaulin and traffic cones. In the unlikely event that John Savage wins his case and every  remaining copy of Flanimals is pulped, I will be delighted.(P.S. - As far as I know, Animal Land is out of copyright, if any enterprising publisher wants to cash-in on the forthcoming Flanimals movie.)"},
{"title": "The Joy of Blogging", "date": "Thursday, December 30, 2010", "text": "I  began blogging four years ago, during a particularly nasty bout of food  poisoning caused by eating bad oysters. At the time, my wife and sons  were away in Essex and after a week of lying in bed, I was so bored that  I decided to create a blog page to pass the time.The title of  this blog was partly an oblique reference to the fact that  HMV had just  bought the bookshop chain I worked for and my future, which  had once  seemed promising, now looked pretty bleak.I had no intention of keeping a proper blog, but when Ms Baroque posted a very generous response to my first post - a rather fatuous piece about the Middle East - I was hooked.During  the last few years, I have been continually impressed by the  intelligence and generosity of spirit displayed by the people who have  posted comments on this blog. Thanks to the kindness of strangers, I  have discovered new authors, visited exhibitions I would have otherwise  missed and had some really interesting email exchanges with people (plus  some very enjoyable drinks in Lewes with Laura and Oliver).So,  getting to the point, I have found blogging to be a very positive,  uplifting experience that has exposed me to the best of humanity, both  in cyberspace and the real world.Sadly, blogging seems to be the  exception rather than the rule. Visit any number of discussion boards  and social networking sites and the comments range from the depressingly  banal to the downright abusive.Take this example from YouTube, which was written in response to a negative comment about the Turkish national anthem:  \"disabled grik!!!...we never did not give the griks and armenian girl, I always have﻿ girls...you carry the dna of turks, bastard griks!!!...idiot you nation turks,mongolian,arab,italian,s­lavic,makedonian,gypsy break-mix and the bastard nation...f*ck you homo!!!...\"             Or this response to a comment about Germany's winning song in this year's Eurovision Song Contest:  \"All the Eastern European dancing prostitute bands are just﻿ pissed they were beaten by someone singing a proper song. It's called Eurovision Song Contest not European Lap Dancing Contest you scumbags.\"  Even the positive comments on YouTube are pretty dispiriting. For example, here is Ivetella's response to a video of \"Silly Love Songs\" by Paul McCartney and Wings:  \"I love the meaning﻿ of this Song, What is wrong with that He ask? \"LOVE\" Nothing is wrong at all,, Bacause Love is power!!!\" It's  depressing to realise that a technology that brings millions of people  together from all over the world, just ends up being used to vent  ancient grievances between different nations and religions. But perhaps,  in the impersonal environment of a global village, people feel a  greater need to assert their local identity.Or maybe they just enjoy being able to be rude without getting beaten up."},
{"title": "Upstairs Downstairs", "date": "Tuesday, December 28, 2010", "text": "Christmas in the Steerforth household has been a subdued affair. With impeccable timing, I came down with \"swine flu\" on Christmas Eve and have been upstairs in bed ever since.Two days later, my wife started to sound like Fenella Fielding and began demanding paracodol.She is now worse than me, although that may be the result of her decision to tackle the symptoms head on by drinking a bottle of wine. I have been more cautious, taking a few tentative sips of port, like a consumptive Victorian gentleman.In all of this, my mother has been the heroine of the hour.Like a special agent called out of retirement for one final mission, my mother has taken charge of the children, introducing them to the delights of white bread and egg and chips, whilst managing to make our kitchen look tidier than ever. It has been good for her and great for us.During one of my more delirious moments, I began to feel as if my entire adult life had been an illusion and I was really back home, in Teddington, listening to my parents in the room below. As if on cue, my mother cleared her throat and the theme tune to \"Upstairs Downstairs\" boomed through the floorboards.Later, my wife explained that it has returned for a new series (if you can call three episodes a series):I caught up with the first episode on the BBC iPlayer and to my amazement, it wasn't crap. Admittedly, Tom Stoppard's son Ed wasn't fantastic, playing the role of Sir Hallam Holland in the style of a regional sales manager for a chain of East Midlands car exhaust centres. But the rest of the cast were spot on (particularly the monkey) and it was particularly wonderful to see the return of Jean Marsh as Rose:I can't wait for the next series."},

{"title": "Derek at Christmas", "date": "Thursday, December 23, 2010", "text": "(If you're new to this blog, click here, here, here, here, here, here and here to understand the background to this post)My  mother has now been living with us for eight weeks and the cracks are  starting to appear. When she was bed-ridden things were fine. All we had  to do was bring up a tray of food three times a day and stop by for the  odd chat. Most of the time, she slept.But several weeks of rest  and good food has restored my mother back to health and she likes to  come downstairs and sit on the sofa.All bloody day.It would  help if we were able to talk about different subjects, but her only  topic of conversation seems to be other people's illnesses. When I tried  talking about my ongoing efforts to learn French, my mother replied: \"Well  Janet went on a course and became fluent, but then she was diagnosed  with motor neurone disease, so I don't suppose she'll need it now.\"If  this is what it's like after eight weeks with someone whose only fault  is to have a limited repertoire of topics of conversation, what must it  have been like for Derek and Brenda, who spent years living with the  infamous \"Nanna\"?Today's extracts come from December 1984. Sadly, Nanna does not appear to have succumbed to the Christmas spirit:A  curious Saturday, with Nanna doing her incredibly lifelike   impersonation of the devil in full spate. She accused Brenda and myself   of being cunning; and accused Brenda of being corrupted by the evil of  my  family. And all because we did her the favour of clearing furniture  out  of her flat, so that a new tenant could move in next Monday. My  thoughts  are fearful concerning her and what she does to my wife. I  lay  in bed awhile this morning and talked with Brenda, mentioning my  concern  that we seemed to have reached a plateau in our relationship  with no  discernible spiritual progress. She agreed with this and then  mentioned  that part of the problem was that she never really felt well,  plus her  waning energy, and more importantly, her mother's malign  daily effect on  her. Though we could think of few remedies, it was good  to get some  thoughts out into the open that we might at least draw  closer by reason  of speaking of hidden and frustrating things.It is little wonder that Derek and Brenda's relationship has lost its  sparkle, when most of their spare time is taken up with looking after a  mentally handicapped son and an elderly mother. It is heartbreaking to  read Derek's first diaries, from the 1950s, when he and Brenda were so  full of hope and optimism.Derek maintains his sanity by keeping his diary and cherishes the  moments when he can sit in his \"library\" and gather his thoughts: I am in my room ,  listening to popped-up classics, and tapping away at these so-familiar  keys. I must have written many millions of words over the years. How  many of them will remain? Few, I opine. And how much of a writing style  do I really have? Does my personality shine through the sentences, or do  they only convey dryness and boredom, that which is learned through the  roteness of pedantic learning and is made up of cliche and  circumlocution? I try to be as precise and  simple as I can in what I write, but rarely compose my thoughts into a  pattern of rich density that will convey in interesting fullness that  which I wish to convey. My fingers fly off too quickly as is evidenced  by the large  number of words in this journal that suffer a  transposition of letters. But which is of more importance--the message  or the medium?Many of Derek's diary entries faithfully record the minutiae of his daily life: Last night when I arrived home, I found things rather chaotic. Brenda  was busy boiling the Christmas puddings, trying to make a cornbeef hash,  and coping with several acres of washing. During the day, she met with  men from the mini-auction rooms who strongly rejected Nana's  refrigerator and gas stove; and she took delivery of our replacement bed  from Owen Owen, the other that we had having sprung a spring and caused a  nasty scratch on Brenda's leg. Later we visted Alan and Dora Burchett. They were sitting quietly at home, peace palpatating from the walls.Occasionally, there is also a little excitement: When I got home last night, I found Brenda surrounded by mounds of  drying washing, the dinner uncooked, and her mother sitting in the front  room, her first venture down in quite a while. Brenda was not too  happy. Her day had gone somewhat awry. Nanna's venture down was  to the purpose of making out a list of the things she wanted from the  shops, and she expected Brenda to do the traipsing about that day. So  Brenda ventured forth and arrived at Tesco's and lo! as she arrived, an  Arab man, accompanied by a young woman, came out of the entrance. The  Arab was immediately followed by another man who seized him with the  words, \"I am making a citizen's arrest; you stole an old lady's bag of  shopping.\" The Arab tried to shake him off, telling him not to be  so stupid, the bag of shopping was his, he saw it just standing there.  At this point, ladies came pouring out of the shop, shouting and  gesticulating, all intent on grabbing the Arab. As usual on such  occasions not a policeman was to be seen.  The Arab shook off the  erstwhile citizen and made off with the bag of shopping.  At this point  Brenda got stubborn, being unwilling that the man should get away just  like that, so she followed the Arab along the High Street until she found  a woman policeman, who promptly called for reinforcements.But the magic of Derek's diaries is that after writing a mundane entry  about his vegetables, or Brenda's headaches, he will suddenly come out  with an extraodrinary paragraph like this: I have a most powerful testimony of pre-existence. I know that I lived  with Heavenly Parents, before I came here, in celestial mansions. They  gave life and progress to that existence our Father organized, an  intelligence that has always existed, but which was locked in the  silence and vastness of dark space without the possibility of progress  until His love and law gave me spiritual life. I do not know my  spiritual age. I believe it to be several thousands of years and that I  stood in His presence in the Grand Council of Kolob when the Plan of  Salvation was presented to us.Meanwhile, on Planet Earth, Derek celebrates his birthday:Upon  this murky, forsaken morning I became 52 years of age and hardly look a  day over twenty-five! But I suppose a mirror can lie, so too much  credence ought not to be placed upon what I see reflected in my mirror  each morning!But in spite of the presence of Nanna, a succession of mysterious  illnesses and constant financial worries, Derek does not feel sorry for  himself. Perhaps this is because he appears to have been a man who was  loved; not only by his family, but also by Derek's friends, colleagues  and members of the local church.Derek's diaries contain letters from many different people and the one  consistent thread running through all of them is a sense of great  affection towards him. For all his absurdities - the Pooterish prose,  the Hooked-on-Classics albums and the rabbits, bounding up and down the  hallway - Derek's life was not a failure.I bet Derek's funeral was packed to the rafters."},
{"title": "Victorian Colour Plates", "date": "Monday, December 20, 2010", "text": "\"Who fed me from her gentle breast,And hush'd me in her arms to rest,And on my cheek sweet kisses prest?My Mother\"So begins a mid-Victorian publication called \"My Mother's Picture Book\", published by George Routledge. It's a fairly unremarkable publication in many ways, but it has some extraordinary colour plates:As I have written before, until recently I had no idea that the Victorians had the technology to produce colour plates. In a previous post I asked why it took so long for colour printing to become the \"norm\" and received this fascinating answer from a graphic designer:\"It's much more complex than just expense. Colour printing and tinting  have been around for a long time, but were expensive, time consuming and  very wasteful - so only small numbers of books or folio's would be  produced, hence their consumer was wealthy, educated and had 'leisure  time' - hardly anyone in Victorian England would fit into that niche -  even the 'middle classes' would baulk at the extravagance of colour  print. as a new technique - it was also an 'entertainment' - which is  why it was generally dedicated to expensive childrens books ( and  scientific folio's ).Later on, as literacy / education /  libraries etc demanded more books - the sheer volume needed made colour  print less than practical - it was still time consuming and too  expensive, only really becoming widely available for mass consumption  after WW2 when giant continual presses could churn out well registerd 4  colour print on demand, and multinpage printing plates can deliver 16  pages in one impression, and now with the advent of digital - we can  have instant single pass printing - which is even faster ( the colour  supplements that come in your weekend papers are printed days before -  it takes time for the print to dry, the stock to be collated and packed -  and before printing even begins - the paper needs to 'rest' in the shop  to acclimatise to the humidity levels )If you have a really  close look - you may find that some of the more subtle colours on your  plates are hand applied - far cheaper than contemporary print.\"These plates must have seemed remarkable to their Victorian audience:This plate is both weird and wonderful. I love the vivid colours and the rather disturbing anthropomorphisation.The canine theme continues for several other plates:Next, we have some disturbing inter-species romance. It reminds me of a very rude joke, which I can't repeat here.As you can see, the romantic ideal of the Victorian era looks like a mid-80s Scouser, sans shellsuit.What always strikes me about Victorian photos and illustrations is how many layers of clothes everyone seems to be wearing. 19th century prudery aside, it's easy to forget how cold everyone must have been for a lot of the year.\"Now Frank, about those magazines we found under your bed...\"Actaully, Frank is the hero in this story, which reads:\"Frank and Robert were two little boys, about eight years old. Whenever Frank did anything wrong, he always told his father and mother of it; and when anyone asked him about anything he had done or said, he always told the truth; so everybody who knew him believed him.\"Good old Frank.\"But nobody who knew his brother Robert believed a word he said, because he used to tell lies. Whenever he did anything wrong, he never told his father and mother of it; but when asked about it, he denied it, and said he had not done it.\"Why is Robert so different? In a penetrating piece of psychoanalysis, we learn that:\"The reason Robert told lies was, because he was afraid of being punished for his faults if he confessed them. He was a coward, and could not bear the least pain.\"This book must have cost a mint in the 1870s. What a pity that these colour illustrations were accompanied by such a plodding, banal text."},
{"title": "Podcasting at The Lewes Arms", "date": "Saturday, December 18, 2010", "text": "After years of running various bookshops in the South East, I have developed a Pavlovian response to the phrase \"local poet\" and automatically go into fight or flight mode. I have good reasons for this, but my blinkered attitude almost stopped me from discovering the wonderful Oliver's Poetry evenings at The Lewes Arms.When fellow blogger Laura told me that her friend Oliver held a monthly poetry evening at a local pub, I imagined that there would be a lot of terribly earnest people reading rather bad poetry and almost didn't go. Luckily, I had the good sense to trust Laura's judgement and had a great evening out.Thanks to Oliver's years spent running a leading comedy club in London, the evenings feel more like a gig, with a good rapport between poet and audience. As for the poems themselves, the quality is consistently high and I often leave wishing that I could hear them again.But if you do visit Oliver's Poetry evening, be warned: you will be expected to write a limerick in the interval!The most recent limerick competition had a Royal Wedding theme:Next month, on Byron's 223rd birthday, Oliver will be publishing a book called The Commuter's Tale:Described as a \"thriller in verse\", The Commuter's Tale was written by Oliver during two years of commuting from Lewes to London.I was going to write an article about the book, but I had a better idea: why not record an interview with Ollie in the convivial surroundings of The Lewes Arms? The result is the first Age of Uncertainty podcast!The following interview was recorded in one take and if I had to do it again, I probably wouldn't have had a couple of pints first, as I sound as if I should be presenting the 1936 Royal Review of the Fleet at Spithead. However, Oliver is thoroughly entertaining.Click on the player below to hear the interview:During the evening, Oliver commented on the fact that a lot of women kept coming up to us. Unfortunately, we soon realised that it was because we were next to the the ladies loo.Another illusion shattered.Here is Oliver in full bardic mood, reading a canto from his new book.For more information about The Commuter's Tale, visit www.deserthearts.com."},

{"title": "New Slinkachu", "date": "Wednesday, December 15, 2010", "text": "One of my favourite books a couple of years ago was Little People in the City, which featured photographs of installations by the street artist Slinkachu.If the name Slinkachu doesn't mean anything to you, his art is quite easy to describe. In a nutshell, he puts model figures - only a couple of centimetres tall - in normal urban settings. Sometimes they're accompanied by minature props like this scene with a toy car:But usually, Slinkachu's figures interact with ordinary, everyday objects, like this piece of orange peel:The results are not only very funny but also occasionally moving, as Slinkachu's \"little people\" try to negotiate their way through a hostile, urban landscape. Their vulnerability is ours. In the artist's own words, \"I like my things to be melancholy, like loneliness, and people lost and alone. I don't know why.\"I have posted some Slinkachu images before, but these ones appear to be new:The reason for this post is to plug Slinkachu's new book, Big Bad City, which is already out of stock at Amazon (but their marketplace sellers still have some).And if you think this might be you're cup of tea, I'd also recommend the blog Economy Custard, which I discovered through the excellent Bookseller Crow's site."},
{"title": "Middle Class Heroes", "date": "Tuesday, December 14, 2010", "text": "Last month I posted a comment on Sam Jordison's blog about the English middle classes, Organic Peas and Orderly Queues.I argued that Lewes was one of the most middle class towns in Britain and cited two examples, one of which was this quote from an interview in local magazine Viva Lewes:Question – “What did you have for breakfast?” Answer – “I had baked millet and quinoa with steamed chicory and  seaweed. And a cup of sage tea. My daughter had blueberries, yoghurt and  nuts.”That is only Exhibit A. I can produce a lot more evidence to prove that Lewes is a strong contender for the top spot, including the following signifiers:A market town with a Liberal MPMainly pre-1900 buildingsNo branch of McDonaldsA local currencyAt least two classical concerts per weekA higher than average number of Lesbian couplesA lack of chain storesTasteful, subdued Christmas lights in the town centreAt least half a dozen \"lifestyle\" shops selling overpriced clothes and kitchewareA high proportion of graduatesSam has responded with this excellent post about Lewes, which certainly lends support to my campaign. But it can only be a matter of time before the citizens of Southwold or Hebden Bridge make their own claim, so I'll have to keep compiling evidence.I tried to find a YouTube clip of one of my favourite Lewes activities, the Dance of Disobedience, during which a group of local people celebrated the life of former resident Tom Paine through the medium of dance. Sadly, I drew a blank.However I did find this:If you're still not convinced, check out the website of one of the most popular independent shops in Lewes (so popular, it now has three branches), Wickle. You'll find no nasty plastic children's toys in Wickle and if little Bruno wants a fire engine for Christmas, they probably have a tasteful one made from responsibly forested Norwegian spruce (actually, I love Wickle and I'm the proud owner of one of their very reasonably-priced wooden toy castles).Wickle is the quintessential Lewes shop.I could go on, but instead I'd urge you to join in the debate at Organic Peas and Orderly Queues, where you can become a middle class traitor! You don't have to live in Britain. I've witnessed the same phenomenon in the USA.I know some people who have read this blog before might wonder, why do I keep banging on about class? Does it really matter?Well, no and yes. On the one hand, this blog post is just a bit of fun, gently mocking the fact that we all too often express our individuality by slavishly imitating people who seem to share the same values. But there is also a more serious side to this debate, namely the fact that even in 2010, every newborn baby's destiny is shaped by a postcode lottery.Visit any class of infants and you'll be struck by how bright and curious most of them are, regardless of their social background. Return six years later and the disparity between the middle class children and the poorest can be dispiriting.As much as I make fun of certain aspects of Lewes, it comes closer to my vision of how life should be lived than most places, although I draw the line at quinoa for breakfast.The Divine Comedy - the ultimate middle class band."},
{"title": "Clogs and Shawls", "date": "Saturday, December 11, 2010", "text": "If someone had told me that my mother would be staying with us for six weeks this year, I would have shuddered with horror. As much as I love her, we are very different people and have little in common. However, it has been remarkably easy.I have had to make some sacrifices, including watching Wycliffe every evening, enduring the public humiliation of buying the Daily Mail and eating a diet of bland, garlic-free meals, but I can live with these.The one thing I am having a problem with is my mother's addiction to romantic novels.My mother is the perfect guest in many ways and demands very little, but there is one exception: when it comes to books, she is like a crack addict. She has a ten-a-week habit and starts to become nervous if she is getting near to the end of the last new book.I am having real problems keeping pace with my mother's addiction. How do I know which titles she hasn't read before? There's no point looking at the blurb, as most of the books seem to have the same basic plot:When Kitty Grindstone's parents drown at sea, she is sent to an orphanage where she is beaten daily. Then, at 16, she meets the handsome squire's son, Jasper Cadman, who promises to show her the love that she so desperately craves. But when Kitty reveals that she is pregnant, Cadman cruelly disowns her. Alone in the world, without a roof over her head, Kitty climbs the snow-covered Yorkshire Dales to join her beloved parents in Heaven. Little does she know that her salvation may lie with a simple farmer's son called Jeremiah Ingleby...Or something like that.Luckily, there are so many books to choose from, I'm in little danger of buying the same book twice (how does my mother manage to remember what she's read, when the plots all seem to follow the same pattern?)In the book trade, this genre is known as Clogs and Shawls. They are bought by female, working-class readers, generally over 50, and are usually written by women (or men pretending to be women, like Emma Blair). Publishers and booksellers can be very dismissive about these novels, but they are the bread and butter of the publishing industry. Without these tales of poverty and illegitimacy, there would be fewer first novels by unknown authors.My mother likes them because they seem realistic. She has no interest in reading about middle-class people or foreigners (so that's over 90% of fiction out of the picture). She wants to read about the world she grew up in and if the plots of these novels seem melodramatic, I have to remind myself that they're tame compared to my mother's family history.I couldn't help smiling to myself when, last week, my mother complained that she was running out of books to read, as she was sitting in front of my bookcase at the time. I looked at the shelves of books behind her and wondered if there was a single title that I could persuade her to read. What about the ultimate clogs and shawls novel, Jane Eyre?And why was she running out of books so quickly? I decided to ask my mother and she sheepishly admitted that she only read the dialogue. She has now agreed to read the prose passages as well, so I should be able to keep pace with my mother's insatiable desire for family sagas until she goes home.Whenever that is."},
{"title": "Parallel Lines", "date": "Thursday, December 09, 2010", "text": "Yesterday a colleague at work sent me a link to a wonderful website called Europa Film Treasures,  which contains a huge archive of films from as long ago as the 1890s.  In particular, he highlighted a short 1913 film featuring a tram ride  through the streets of Dunkirk.That may not sound terribly promising, but the key thing is that the film was taken from the tram, not of  it, so the viewer is treated to a fascinating glimpse of life in the  early 20th century. Our perception of the early 20th century as a rather  stuffy, orderly world with polite, well-behaved children, is a far  cry from the more anarchic one depicted in this short film.I haven't been able to embed the video, so you'll have to click on the picture to see the film:The cheeky lads who dodge in an out of the tram's path and kick a market stall would probably receive an ASBO today. But given that this was 1913, a much grimmer fate must have awaited some of the boys.The  website also includes another tram-based gem from 1908, shot in  Barcelona. In this film, a ridiculously large number of people appear to  have a death wish and narrowly escape from being crushed under the  wheels of the tram. Perhaps these people still dared to think that the  streets belonged to them.You can see the film here:The  website's other gems include an 1899 re-enactment of the Dreyfuss  affair, a history of saucy Austrian films from the fin de siecle and this hilarious performance of the Traffic Policeman's Song.These short films strike a contrast with the stiff, formal world  portrayed in many photographs from this period. Suddenly, the past  doesn't seem quite so foreign."},
{"title": "The Noble Savage", "date": "Monday, December 06, 2010", "text": "Although I like to think of myself as a bona fide  member of the middle classes, I know that my RP accent, well-chosen  wines and tasteful watercolours are a smokescreen. Deep down, I belong  to the respectable working class - an extinct species who regularly went  to church, didn't drink alcohol and owned the complete works of  Shakespeare.I thought I'd successfully expunged the shackles of  my background, but there are still a few vices that remain, including a  fondness for net curtains (plain, I hasten to add), a sentimental  attachment to the Royal Family and a weakness for crysanthemums.When  I discover photos like these, from a collection that turned up last  week, it is as if I have found a lost album from my own family's past:If  you were a member of the respectable working classes, then you had  standards to maintain. It didn't matter whether you were in your back  garden or on a beach; you didn't dress like the ruffians who frequented  the local social club .There was a good reason for this. My  mother's grandfathers spent their leisure time drinking, gambling and  siring illegitimate children. If their wives complained, they were  beaten. The generation that followed took their revenge by signing the Pledge, going to chapel and assuming the trappings of respectability.My maternal grandparents died long before I was born, but their photograph albums feature people who look exactly like this:As  you can see, there is a slightly punk rock gesture from the man on the  left, but overall, with their waistcoats and watch chains, these  gentlemen are the epitome of respectability. Indeed, the man with the  large head even went bathing in a full suit:However, when posing with a loaf of bread, he always wore his best flatcap:Here is a rare colour shot. The woman in white's skirt features a pattern that reminds me of a pair of curtains from 1990:This  album stopped somewhere in the early to mid 1950s, but in the same box,  there was a single, loose photo from more recent times:They  look as if they're having a good time, but now that I'm middle class, I  would naturally insist on bringing my own supply of St Peter's Organic Ale and locally-sourced sausages."},

Some years ago, when I lived in Twickenham, a water main burst and flooded a small but vital section of road known as \"The Dip\". For over a week, the road was closed and all buses and cars had to be rerouted. Suddenly, the world seemed a much kinder, gentler place, dominated by the sounds of birdsong and the wind rustling the leaves of trees. I felt calmer and happier.Today, apart from a few Landrovers, the only sounds we heard were the screaming of children, the crunching of footsteps in snow and bleating of sheep. I'll feel a real sense of loss when the traffic starts moving again.I took a few photos of snowy lanscapes, but they look like everyone else's.

{"title": "And Mother Makes Five", "date": "Wednesday, December 01, 2010", "text": "In a juxtaposition that would have been worthy of a mediocre episode of Casualty, while my family and I were transforming ourselves into the living dead for Halloween, my mother was being rushed to hospital by ambulance. In Casualty, I suppose I would have been standing by her bed as she lay dying, dressed as a vampire, with the make-up running down my face.Fortunately, life is rarely as crass as a BBC hospital drama and after nine days of being connected to various drips and machines, my mother pulled through.The NHS is a wonderful emergency service. They saved my father's life and gave him another 11 years, during which he saw the birth of his first grandchild. Unfortunately, this excellence does not always extend itself to the basic nursing care that is so vital if people are to recover from operations and illnesses.My father ended up dying from the MRSA bug, in conditions that reminded me of Guantanamo Bay: kept in isolation, strapped to a bed, with a radio playing nothing but white noise and painfully bright sunlight beating down on his face.My father-in-law's case was even worse. Two years ago, he had a small lump removed from his tongue. The eight-hour operation was a complete success and although we had been warned that his speech would be affected, within a day he was able to chat on the phone. I won't relate the details here, but as a result of an appalling dereliction of duty by two of the nursing staff, a simple complication resulted in irreparable brain damage.Three weeks later this healthy man in his 60s, who had been paragliding only months earlier, died. The hospital later admitted full responsibilty.Of coure, these are two isolated incidents and perhaps my wife and I have just been unlucky. Overall, I'm a big fan of the National Health Service, but I couldn't help feeling a little jittery at the prospect of leaving my mother at the mercy of a large, impersonal hospital. How well would she convalesce in a noisy environment where the lights weren't turned off until 2.00am and the  staff consisted of an ever-changing line-up of agency nurses?But convalescence wasn't even an option. The moment my mother was no longer in danger of dying, she was discharged. On Monday she was being fed intravenously. On Tuesday she was expected to go home and cook a meal. I couldn't let this happen, so after a frantic weekend of tidying my youngest son's bedroom, building a bed and washing sheets, I picked my mother up from Teddington and drove her down to Lewes.For the last four weeks, my mother has been completely pampered. A combination of rest, good food and company has worked wonders and she now seems to be back to her old self again. At some point we will have to make a decision about what happens next (moving to a nearby warden-assisted flat seems the most sensible option), but for the time being it's important that my mother feels that she can stay for as long as she likes.We're quite different people. This is her bathroom:Whereas ours is a more chaotic envionment, consisting of a Swedish barometer, far too many plastic toys, dozens of bottles and unashamedly naked loo rolls. But I think my mother is happy here. She hasn't mentioned going home.If you have noticed a decline in the quantity and quality of my blog posts recently, this is my excuse. At the moment I no longer have the time to peruse the vast archive of Derek's diaries and even scanning old photographs feels like a major task, so please forgive the lazy YouTube links and barely-edited posts.Normal service will hopefully be restored in the near future."},

George Eliot, once described by Henry James as  \"magnificently ugly\" never had to endure the humiliation of the  dustjacket author photo.I wonder how many writers agonise over  their official author photos. Even if you're confident about your looks  (or past caring), there is the question of what to wear and what pose to  adopt. An open smile is obviously out - you're a writer - but will a  half-smile make you look approachable or smug? Perhaps it's better to  play it straight, but that can end up looking miserable or  self-important.I remember one young American writer who decided  to be photographed standing in front of a brick wall, wearing his best  Levi's. I think he wanted to look edgy and urban, but he ended up  looking stiff and uncomfortable, with one thumb half-heartedly placed  inside his righthand pocket. Perhaps I was being more critical because I  knew that his wife had taken the picture in leafy Richmond-upon Thames,  but still I don't think it worked as an image.He should have gone for this look:This  is the quintessential author photo. I love the half-closed left eye and  faraway look, as if the writer is busy contemplating the contents of  his next novel. The pipe, old school tie and neatly-trimmed beard all  add to the air of gravitas. Sadly, for the author at least, his books are now out of print.But there's another profession who must have had an even harder time striking the right pose:Before  the \"happy clappy\" movement made joy a virtual sacrament,  clergymen were supposed to exude an air of intellectual rigour and  unworldliness. This gentleman looks as if he'd be happiest debating the  finer points of transubstatiation, or which Bach organ sonata is the  greatest.Where did it all go wrong? I blame William Booth.On  the subject of sacraments, is marriage one of them? The Catholic and  Orthodox churches say yes; the Protestants say no. Whatever the answer,  is there any excuse for these transgressions:Not only are the bridegrooms breaking several fashion by-laws, but they actually seem happy.This is really going against the grain. Over the last year or so, I have  published of number of amusing wedding photographs in which the bride  is clearly up the duff and the bridegroom is approaching the altar with  the stoic resignation of a condemned man.At least this couple seem more traditional, right down to the miserable faces:The figures in the background are like a Greek chorus.Oh  dear, there's no turning back. At least, not until the first affair  with the girl in the typing pool. But this wedding isn't a completely  grim affair and some people seem to be enjoying themselves:I wonder where the honeymoon was? Would it have been somewhere as exotic as this European location:If  you click on the photo, you should be able to see more. I'd love to  travel 50 years back in time and join this coach party, although I'd  draw the line at sing-songs.This photo isn't quite as old, but I still find it bizarre that the  fastest passenger aircraft in the world made its debut 41 years ago and  has now been retired, whilst the lumbering Jumbo Jets still take seven  hours to get to New York:The  problem with Concorde is that there weren't enough people who wanted  Phil Collins to play two concerts on each side of the Atlantic on the  same day.1969 was a watershed year for many people: Neil Armstrong walked on the  moon, the first supersonic airliner made its maiden flight and Monty  Python made its debut on British television. There was a genuine  excitement about every new technological development. People felt that  they were on the brink of the Space Age.Can you imagine crowds of ordinary people turning out to see a new aeroplane these days?It's  strange how the future is now in the past. That's not an entirely bad  thing though. I know that postmodernism is a dirty word in some circles,  but for every Apollo programme and supersonic airliner, there were  dozens of awful, dehumanizing civic building schemes, in which  reinforced concrete was ubiquitous.Before I post these photos, I usually clean them up a little, removing  any large distracting smudges and correcting the colour balance (but not  too much - I still want them to look old).However, this image has defeated me:I suppose that it's beyond repair, but if anyone has any ideas I'd love to know."},

{"title": "More Victorian Photographs", "date": "Friday, November 12, 2010", "text": "Last month I posted some highlights from a remarkable collection of photographs from the 1860s, which had been retrieved from a skip. Today, another mid-Victorian album was rescued by a keen-eyed person at work.This selection of photos, which appear to have been taken in parts of East Anglia and Lincolnshire, isn't quite in the same league as last month's find. There are too many studio portraits and most have a stiffness and formality that was, on the whole, refreshingly absent in the earlier album. But there are still some striking images.Take this, for example:This almost looks like a modern pastiche of Victorian photographs, as the woman's face seems so contemporary.The same couldn't be said for the next photograph. When a colleague at work saw it, he confidently announced \"Here we have empirical proof that people were much uglier in the past.\"The next photo reminded another colleague of a certain novel by Dickens:When she asked me if I'd ever read \"David Copperfield\" I almost choked, but after quickly regaining my composure, I agreed with my colleague that the man could have been Daniel Peggotty (certainly not Steerforth).Open any Victorian photograph album and you will see at least one woman wearing black.My father hated anything that smacked of the 19th century. He had grown up surrounded by Victorians and took great delight in destroying all of the original features of our 1880s house, pebbledashing the redbrick walls and replacing the sash windows with mock Georgian. When I started wearing long black coats and boots, he was apoplectic with rage: \"You look as if you're going to a funeral.\"My inevitable retort stopped being funny when his health started to decline.But although he professed to hate black clothes, shortly before he died, my father confessed that he fancied the woman in the Scottish Widows commercials.This beard seems to fade out rather than stop. How long is it? Today, a beard like this would stop traffic, but of course, in the 1870s it was perfectly normal and some of my favourite people - Brahms, Darwin and Monet - all sported remarkable, soup-retaining expanses of facial hair.A mother and son photo I presume. I've noticed that quite a few women in the photos from this period chose to be pictured holding a book - presumably the Bible. I like the idea of having a portrait taken surrounded by significant objects, like Holbein's Ambassadors.These men appear to be holding some of the tools of their trade:Is that grass in the foreground? Perhaps this portrait was taken outside, with a portable backdrop and strip of carpet to create the illusion of an opulent interior?I love this picture. There's a compelling intimacy in this close-up portrait that makes me wish I could know the person in it. And she has beautiful eyes.A rare outdoor shot, with a mysterious figure in the doorway.If you ever wondered why people of a certain age had antimacassars on their armchairs and sofas, look at this man's slicked-back hair. Grease is the word.This was a frustrating album. Most of the photos were developed in Wisbech and Boston, but there were also pictures from places as far afield as Llandudno and London. With no images of notable buildings, it is impossible to determine where these people lived . As far as dates are concerned, only two images are marked: 1867 and 1874.Last month's Cockerham album turned out to be an important social document. Today's collection is less engaging, but there are still plenty of memorable images and amongst these unfamilar faces, there might be an ancestor of somebody we know today.Can you see any familiar faces?"},

I am a trainspotter spotter.Having said that, I think that trainspotters and railway enthusiasts are quite different creatures. Trainspotting, at its purest, has been cited as a classic sympton of Asperger's Syndrome - an obsession with collecting data that has no meaning beyond its own terms of reference. The railway enthusiast, on the other hand, is driven by nostalgia: a deep-seated longing to leave the messy, complex and disappointing present for an idyllic, model railway vision of society, where everything connects, runs on time and makes sense.I can relate to that.I had never heard of the Mangapps Railway Museum at Burnham-on-Crouch. Given that this was a school half-term holiday with reasonably mild weather, I expected to see a few families ambling around the exhibits, but as I reached the end of a long dirt track, it was clear that the car park was completely empty.No families. Not even those strange, middle-aged men with moustaches and very expensive SLR cameras that tend to proliferate in these sorts of places.Why was I the only visitor?The museum's website says that it is \"believed\" to have the largest signalling collection on public display in Britain. Even on a quiet Friday afternoon in late October, there must be enough signalling fans out there to provide a steady stream of visitors. Perhaps the museum's fairly remote location, on the Dengie peninsula, was an obstacle.In addition to a fine collection of signals, the museum had some splendid signs:There were also some intriguing machines like this one, which helped to ensure that the trains all ran to the timetable:I can see the attraction of displays like these. They represent a world of fixed values and certainties. Gradients, distances between stations and capacities of branch lines are all constants. In this world, there are no incompetent private contractors or draconian branch line closures, whilst private cars are for the sole use of the very wealthy and the emergency services.Was the world ever like this poster?I'm very tempted to ask to see my local Station Master (although in Lewes I wouldn't be entirely surprised if an immaculately-dressed, rather rotund man with mutton chop sideburns and a gleaming pocket watch suddenly emerged from a hidden door).With no \"railfans\" to spot, my visit seemed rather pointless. But I perked up when I saw this old London Underground Northern Line carriage:I love being able to walk around a train carriage that must have carried hundreds of thousands of commuters over several decades of use and relish every detail, from the upholstery of the seats to the advertisements above them.For me, the real attraction of any museum is the social history. A few years ago I visited the National Railway Museum in York and whilst I could coldly admire the enginering achievements of the various locomotives, the things that really excited me were the Royal Trains through the ages: the opulence of Queen Victoria's carriage, the Art Deco fittings of George VI's and the relative austerity of Elizabeth II's.This museum was too functional for my tastes and I would have liked to have seen more social history. Parts of the museum felt like a collection of objects thrown together, rather than a curated display with any narrative, and I would imagine that even in the railway community, there aren't that many people interested in signals and signalling devices.Of course, I could be wrong.In my ideal railway museum, there would be more of the everyday objects that passengers took for granted until they suddenly disappeared: the Nestle chocolate dispensers, the make-your-own record booths, the platform-ticket machines and the leather window straps of carriages like this one:Should museums preach to the converted or try and engage the uninterested? The best should be able to do both, presenting displays that are accessible but not dumbed-down.But I'm not complaining. After having the second oldest building to myself in the morning, I went on to enjoy being the sole occupant of a museum. I felt like an aristocrat, relishing the privilege of a private viewing. Do I want these places to get their act together and attract more visitors?Probably not."},
{"title": "A Jolly Day Out in London", "date": "Friday, November 05, 2010", "text": "Today I have another example of something that was almost thrown into the skip at work. It's a project book, compiled by a group of Middlesborough schoolgirls in 1935, describing their day trip to London.The book has no financial value, but I find it touching and enchanting:They girls apear to have had a whistlestop tour of London, visiting St Paul's Cathedral, Westminsster Abbey, the House of Lords, the House of Commons, London Zoo and Trafalgar Square:In spite of this exhausting itinerary, they also found time to visit Convent Garden:But the highlight of their day appears to have been London Zoo:After visiting one historic building after another, the zoo must have come as a huge relief to the girls, although one pupil had an unfortunate encounter with an elephant:\"One came up to me called Co-Coal and took a biscuit from me which I was about to eat. I was ever so frightened and I hid be hind my school teacher, Miss Bean because I thought that it was going to eat me, but my teacher said 'Don't worry Dorothy, you wouldn't make a mouthful.'\"I'm accustomed to school trips ending in the middle of the afternoon, but the girls from South Bank must have been made of stronger stuff:In an age in which there was no television and only the privileged few travelled abroad, this day-trip to London must have very exciting. It is not the thing in itself that is important, but the anticipation, preparation and experience of being part of a group in a different environment.I had a similar experience on a much smaller scale when I was 10 years old and living in a children's home. One day we received an invitation to visit the Post Office Tower as special guests and it was one of the most memorable days of my life. I will never forget the moment when we climbed into the back of a London taxi and Sister Davey turned to the driver and said \"Post Office Tower, please - VIP entrance.\"Our normal lives were humdrum and routine. The home was run with a military precision and we knew that each day would be like the one before. For one magical day, life felt like a big adventure. I don't remember much about the Post Office Tower, but the experience of seeing a world beyond our four walls was one I'll never forget.If this project book was created in 1935, then it's possible that some of these pupils are still alive.I wonder if any of them still remember a terrified Dorothy Williamson, cowering behind the reassuring figure of Miss Bean.Two things caught my eye today. The first is a photograph that fell out of a copy of \"Creative Malady\" by George Pickering:The second is a beautiful frontispiece from a children's novel called \"Sinister Island Squadron - a Flying Story of the Pacific\".In  the Guardian Weekend magazine's questionnaire, when people are asked  what their superpower would be, they nearly always pick invisibility or  flying, but mine would be to enter pictures like these."},

As usual, none of them had any writing on the back to indicate where or when they were taken.The first is a very striking, hand-tinted portrait, that was found inside a copy of \"Queer People\" by Basil Thomson:The next two were part of a set from Hong Kong.

{"title": "The Second Oldest Building in England", "date": "Saturday, October 30, 2010", "text": "Travelling around Britain, it's sometimes hard to avoid the feeling that  you're in a heritage theme park, full of brown tourist attraction  signs, pointing the way to dubious sites like the Honiton Lace Musuem, or disappointing ruins like Tintagel Castle.Once, I naïvely  assumed that these signs were an official endorsement, awarded by  nameless, incorruptible officials -a guarantee of quality. But that's  not how it works. A run-of-the-mill farm shop (with the obligatory  soft-play area for children) can become a major tourist attraction,  whilst a Neolithic burial chamber is unknown to all but a few.But perhaps that's a good thing. Today, I was able to have the second oldest building in mainland Britain all to myself.Built  in the year 654, using bricks and stones from the ruined Roman fort of  Othona, the Chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall was established for the East  Saxons. Its founder, St Cedd, had travelled down from Lindisfarne at the  request of the local king, Sigebehrt the Good. Like the oldest building  in Britain - the Roman \"Pharos\" lighthouse at Dover - it is largely  unknown.It seems inexplicable that Britain's oldest church only  receives a trickle of visitors. Where are the coach parks and gift shops  selling Anglo-Saxon shortbread and St Cedd tea towels? But perhaps the  reason why St Peter's is so neglected is also the key to why it has  survived for 1,356 years.I can almost see St Peter's from my  mother-in-law's bedroom window. Bradwell-on-Sea is only two miles away,  on the other side of the Blackwater estuary. But getting there involves a  tortuous hour-long journey along minor roads that pass through flat,  empty fields and peopleless villages. My journey was only 30 miles, but  by the time I arrived I had listened to a whole Vaughan Williams  symphony (the 9th) and was halfway through another CD.I didn't like  Bradwell-on-Sea. On the surface, it wasn't that different from  other villages: a Norman church and a single street of charming,  traditional cottages, augmented by a mixture of cheap, badly designed modern houses. But I didn't like the way the people stopped and stared,  pointing at me as I drove past. I had visions of some Wicker Man-style  ceremony awaiting me.Fortunately, St Peter's Chapel isn't  actually in Bradwell, but can be found at the end of a long track. I  don't know why the car park is so far from the church, but the ten  minute walk between the two is like a decompression chamber between the  21st century and the 7th. With each step I became more attuned to my  surroundings.I  thought of all the people across fourteen centuries who had walked  along this path, listening to the distant roar of sea and shingle,  longing for some respite from the biting cold wind.Architecturally,  St Peter's seems primitive and crude, but in an age in which homes were  built out of wood and thatch, this church must have seemed miraculous:When  I entered the church,  I was immediately struck by the smell of the  damp stones and the eerie silence - so quiet that I could hear the  ringing in my ears. But as I sat still and listened, I became aware of  the sound of the wind, buffeting against the outside walls.The  desolate landscape, the cold wind and the roaring sea reminded me of the  Anglo-Saxon poem, The Seafarer . For much of the year, life must have  been cold and hard for the people here. St Peter's church offered  meaning in a world that, for many, must have been a relentless struggle  against nature and ill fortune.Fæder ure þu þe eart on heofonum, Si þin nama gehalgod, to becume þin rice, gewurþe ðin willa...The  church appears to have changed very little since the 7th century and  although the crucifix, pews, alter and pulpit are all 20th century, they  seem to complement rather than detract from the atmosphere of the  place.Outside, nettles sway in the wind and the grass gradually turns into marshland:In  East Sussex, there is a dramatic demarcation between land and sea, with  towering chalk cliffs and steep shingle ridges. But in this part of  Essex, the land just seems to fizzle out, as if someone has lost  interest.I don't know how long I was in the church, but when I  left I felt  different. It wasn't a religious experience, but I think   that being alone in an ancient building can have a profound effect,   briefly freeing us from the tyranny of the present. It was either that,  or I was feeling weak from having nothing but Special K that morning.Why  is St Peter's chapel generally ignored by the guide books? It may not  be the most architecturally stunning building, even by Dark Ages  standards, but this is the second oldest complete building in England.  Surely it's more exciting than the Honiton Lace Museum?Part of  the answer lies in St Peter's remoteness. Situated at the end of the  Dengie peninsula - a landscape of bleak, empty fields, with a coastline  of marshland and mudflats - Bradwell feels like a long way from anywhere  (this is probably why a nuclear power station was built there in the 1950s). The nearest large town is only 15 miles away, but it might as well be 50.As  I drove out of the car park, I looked in the rear view mirror and saw a  large wooden structure. It looked familiar, but I didn't know why. Then  I remembered:"},

Unconsciously he filled up and applied a match to the tobacco, meanwhile settling himself more comfortably in his chair.\"Your first question, Sir Allen, has already been answered.

{"title": "Clarke Hutton", "date": "Saturday, October 23, 2010", "text": "Yesterday I discovered this children's history book, published in 1945  by Oxford University Press. It has some stunning colour illustrations  that remind me of Eric Ravilious and Edward Bawden:I'd  never heard of the author. Clarke Hutton sounds like the  name of a character in an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel. I can see him now:  tall and athlectic, with brilliantined hair, baggy trousers and spats. He  probably went to Yale and his family can trace their ancestry back to  17th century New England.I Googled Hutton's name and found next to nothing: no Wikipedia entry,  no fan site and just one mention on the Tate Galleries' website, which  was a masterpiece of brevity: \"Clarke Hutton. Born 1898.\"Further research revealed that Hutton died in 1988. Then another site  claimed that it was 1966. Like David Karp and, to some extent, Sir  Philip Gibbs, here was yet another example of a talented person from the  mid-20th century languishing in undeserved obscurity.Clarke Hutton's book is a whistlestop tour of British history, from  prehistoric times to the 1940s All of the illustrations are  impressive, but I particularly like his depictions of the 20th century:Someone  at Oxford University Press evidently also likes Hutton's illustrations, as the  book was recently reissued. I would have expected this to have generated some reviews in the press or blogosphere, but apart from a brief mention  in the Times, the response has been underwhelming.Fortunately, a little more Googling has enabled me to come up with the briefest of biographical sketches.Clark Hutton was born in London in 1898. He studied at the Central  School for Arts and Crafts under A. S. Pitcher, replacing him in 1930 as  the instructor in lithography. As soon as he took up his post, Hutton  began to experiment with using the autolitho technique for book  illustration. His aim was to develop a process that would make it  possible to produce affordable, colour illustrated books for children.Working with Noel Carrington at Penguin, Hutton eventually realised his vision and the Picture Puffin imprint was  born.That's as much as I know. I have no idea when Hutton died, where he  lived or whether he had children. I'd love to know more and hope that  someone out there will be able to add some more information about this  unjustly forgotten artist."},

{"title": "1860s Update", "date": "Monday, October 18, 2010", "text": "The response to this post about a Victorian photograph album  that was almost destroyed has been overwhelming. It probably helped  that one of the images featured this rather terrifying looking  gentleman:Within  hours, bloggers all over the world were arguing about how many of the  photos featured dead people. Apparently, it wasn't unusual for  Victorians to dress the recently departed in their Sunday best for one  last family portrait and, with the requirement to stand still for long  periods of time, the deceased had a clear advantage. It's a spooky  thought.However, I'm not particularly good at determining  whether people are alive or dead. I got it wrong with my wife's  grandmother and I'm not making that mistake again, so I shall stick to  the more earthly matter of where these photos were taken.The  general consensus has been that the photos from this album are from the  Lake District, but after extensive research (i.e. a couple of hours on  Sunday afternoon), I can now confirm that they come from a village a few  miles south of Lancaster called Cockerham.Here is the evidence:The two photos of St Michael's church are pretty conclusive, but I was less convinced by this match:Even allowing for alterations, the two incarnations of the Manor Inn seemed very different.But then I found this:According to this webpage, when the original Manor Inn closed, its owner bought the Plough Inn and renamed it after his old pub.The album also featured several photographs of this church:This  proved to be the greatest challenge. I scoured Google images for Lake  District churches, then Lancashire, followed by Yorkshire; but nothing  matched. I began to wonder if the church had been demolished or  destroyed - surely somewhere with such a distinctive spire would appear  on Google?Fortunately, once I'd confirmed Cockerham as the  location for many of the photos, I was able to narrow my search to the  neighbouring villages and within minutes, I found this:It's in a nearby village called Ellel, which has inspired one of the shortest Wikipedia entries I've ever come across.The  questions I really want an answer to will, of course, remain a  tantalising mystery. But I like the fact that 150 years on, these places  are still recognisable and that if I want to, I can still enjoy a pint  at the Manor Inn.STOP PRESS - In a slightly spooky twist of fate, it has emerged that Cockerham is very well known to the writer Sam Jordison, who kindly mentioned this blog in a Guardian post in August.He had one of his first pints in the Manor Inn!Visit the comments secition to learn more."},
{"title": "Derek in 1980", "date": "Saturday, October 16, 2010", "text": "If you're new to this blog, you will be unaware of the growing cult of Derek. Click here, here, here, here, here, here and here to understand the background to this post. If you don't have time to do that, the short answer is that these are extracts from the diaries of a civil servant called Derek.Here he is in the 1950s:The end of the 1970s was a turning point in Derek's life. He had been a devout Mormon since his 20s and now, in his middle years, an opportunity had arisen to become a bishop within the church. It would mean moving almost 200 miles away to a town in the West Country, but neither Derek nor Brenda seemed to have had any reservations. Their three daughters were now adults and were busy making their way in the world. Derek and Brenda's teenage son was a different story. He would never leave.'And so our son reaches his birthday. Each year is a bonus. And what of his birthday? Well, it started  with gifts, including a set of sound-affected lights so that he can have blinking lights while playing his records and thus be a real disco fanatic. Unfortuntately two of the bulbs were broken. He had also received an Abba tape and a case for his favourite cassette tapes. And as a bonus, I gave him 200 sheets of his favourite paper for copying what he refers to as \"details\" - items from the Radio Times. He has a marvellous memory for details concerning radio and television programmes. One only has to ask him who is reading the news for the week and out comes the answer.'Derek's paternal pride is particularly touching, because his son is mentally handicapped.Like every other journal of Derek's, he complains of mysterious aches and pains that blight his daily life. They are clearly largely psychosomatic, but Derek seems oblivious to this. It never occurs to him that the strain of caring for a handicapped son and a belligerent mother-in-law should have any impact on Derek's health.Occasionally, Dereks maladies affect his performance at work:'I was much troubled by hypertension last night, and in fact most of yesterday. I spent my lunch break in the gallery at the Registrar Office, lying on a roll of corrugated brown cardboard and a borrowed cushion, trying to relax away the stress that causes my system to creak and groan like an ancient motor engine. If the weather had been better I would have lain on the roof - an excellent place for catching the sun and avoiding the wind (external). However, this luxuriating can get me into difficulty, for on Thursday I was on the roof, ensconced between two gables, and dropped off to sleep. Since I was assinged to two marriages there was considerable panic. At last, David Hooker decided to search the roof and found me. Jeers and laughter arose from the staff as I made my humble way down the stairs; it was counted as the funiest event in some time.'Another theme that recurs in each journal is Derek's conviction that his  diaries will be an invaluable legacy for his children and  grandchildren:'I mentioned my idea to Brenda to type up my journals and give a copy to  each of the girls, and she does not think it is a good idea at all! She  sees it as something rather egoistical that they are not likely to  thank me for at all. Actually, the passing of something of myself to  future descendants had not entered my head; my chief thought was to  provide a history of our life as a family. After conversing with Brenda,  I am resolved to continue this undertaking, for it is something I feel  deep in my bones: a compelling urge that cannot be dispelled even by  the most compelling arguments.'Derek appears to be enjoying his new role as a bishop, although he is  dismayed to find that he is required to intervene in rather complicated  domestic matters involving divorcees and adulterers. When a lost sheep  returns to the flock, Derek's relief is palpable:'Jennifer Griffin is very much an improved lady since she gave up  receiving false revelations. She is now actively pursuing a course in  hotel management.'In the evenings, Derek loves to take his son to a wrestling match or old-time music hall show:'On Monday evening we took Richard to the Winter Gardens to an old tyme  music hall, and O! how he enjoyed singing along with the choruses, for  he is an expert on pub and music hall songs. The hall was packed with  senior citizens. In fact, we were the youngest people there! During the  course of the evening, the call went out \"Is there a doctor in the  house?\" and everyone laughed. But it was a serious request and eventually a lady  was taken away by ambulance. Afterwards we bought three bags of chips and walked home, chobbling as  we went. This was the first time Richard has ever had the sweet joy of  passing through the streets at night with a bag of chips in his hand.  His delight was almost palpable.'At Derek's workplace there is talk of taking industrial action against the policies of the new Tory government. Derek would have none of this. In a passage that could have been written today, he writes:'No one likes the policies the Government has brought in to put the country back on its feet, and there is a suspicion that the rich are being better cared for than the poor. At the same time the alternative can only be eventual ruin for the country as a civilised society - rather like Rome as it plunged into the dark night of the closing of empire.But as a Crown servant, I am precluded by law from embarking on industrial action; but never have I had the inclination to take such.'1980 seems to be a good year for Derek's family. One daughter is engaged to a policeman that both Derek and Brenda thoroughly approve of. Another has just enjoyed a holiday abroad, although Derek has mixed feelings about that:'She and Kerry went to a disco, getting back at 12.30am. I wish she would not attend such places; they are dens of iniquity and the atmosphere cannot be conducive in any way to spirituality. The local male inhabitants have this thing about breasts. But she is of age; she must do as she will do.'Derek and Brenda appear to have successfully carved out a new life for themselves in the West Country and they enjoy exploring the local area and socialising with old and new friends. One day they receive an invitation to have dinner at a friend's new house in Taunton:'They put on a most excellent spread - prawn cocktail, side salad, fondes of chicken, prime steak, and pork, with chips and sausage meat, and such a variety of sauces as to be inclusive of everything in any possible catalogue.We left their home at five to eleven and had an uneventful trip until we got to Oldmixon. And then the devil tried to destroy us. As we drove along the main road, a yellow car came speeding across a junction. There was no pause in the pace of the vehicle; he must have been travelling at all of 60-miles per hour. There was no chance that he could miss us or that we could take any avoiding action. He rushed into the side of the van with a nightmare sound that I can hear even now. There was the noise and the rain and the screaming and the helplessness of uncontrolled movement. And then there was pain as well, and Brenda sitting there in the driving seat, terribly bruised about the head, her hands dripping with blood, and crying out over and over again, \"It wasn't my fault, was it? It wasn't my fault, was it?\" And myself assuring her that it was not, and a terrible tightness around my stomach where the seat-belt had wedged; and our daughter thrown from the back seat amid a jumble of goods. And the screeching of cars and the shouting of men and the absence of the windscreen, and friendly hands reaching in trying to undo the seat belt. Eventually they cut it with a knife and the police came and the ambulance; and Brenda was placed bruised and bleeding on a stretcher and reached out to hold my hand. And the rain still came down, a curtain to hide the hideous wreckage of the vehicles; and it all seemed like some Goyan nightmare.'Hours later, Derek is lying on a stretcher in the local hospital. Suddenly he hears a familiar voice.'Frank Beaston, just admitted for a check-up, having swooned at the wheel of his omnibus again. I called and he came and he grasped my hand and the tears started to his eyes.'Fortunately, Derek and his daughter only have superficial wounds. They are discharged in the small hours of the morning.'Before we left the hospital, we crept into the ward where Brenda lay, and I spoke to her and laid my hands upon her head and gave her a whispered blessing. She was confused and had taken a most terrible knock to the head, but she knew me and clung to my hand.'Later, the police describe Derek and his family's survival as nothing short of miraculous. Derek thanks God, convinced that 'had his hand not been upon us we would surely have died.'It is a difficult time for Derek and his family. In addition to recovering from their injuries, they have to co-operate in a police investigation to establish who the guilty party is. Derek's morale is at a low ebb and at one point he writes:'Non-day suceeds non-day; and we sit and nurse our bruises and count our losses; and still the worst part is wondering whether any good can happen to this family. When each disaster succeeds the next almost without interruption, it becomes most difficult to exercise faith; not in the sense of increasing disbelief, for that God lives and the gospel is true is a fact like breathing as far as we are concerned, but whether we as a family shall ever have a little peace and prosperity in this life is the big question.'Luckily, Derek enjoys a brief respite from his existential gloom when he and his daughter go to see The Empire Strikes Back:'Marvellous stuff! The complete science fiction adventure for boys young and old. We sat enthralled for over two hours at the sights and wonders on the screen and the continuous action.  The effects were - in more ways than one - out of this world. The vast landscapes and monstrous machines, the curious animals all were incredible and yet believeable; but they never overshadowed the characters - Darth Vader continued to dominate the villainy like a sort of galactic Hitler; Luke Skywalker had perceptibly grown in character. Given the opportunity I shall see this sequel at least once more.I understand from the tabloids the films planned run to nine in number. That worries me somewhat; I ponder whether it will be possible to sustain the action and the wonder and the growth of the characters for nine films. I would hate there to be a falling off.'In December, Derek looks back at the past year comes to this conclusion:And what of my past year? Well, certainly it has been full of curious things. My first year as a bishop, one of the greatest honours that can come to any man in this church. My eldest daughter's marriage to a fine young man. The accident, plus the loss of the van. Our first year in our new home. The opportunity of doing more reading than has been possible in a long time, one of the great blessings of commuting to and fro on the train. A room where for the first time in my life I can see almost the full extent of my library instead of having to hide books in cupboards and boxes.'But there is one serious threat to Derek's optimism: Brenda's mother:'A curious lethargy lay upon myself and Brenda. I put it down to a return to the eating of white bread rather than the wheatmeal we have been having. The problem is, Brenda's mother will not eat brown bread, so Brenda reverted to getting white again. Anyway, I got a loaf of granuary bread for for dinner sandwich and felt better almost immediately. The simple solution is for Nanna to have her own little loaf.'It's an absurdly mundane anecdote, but somehow the quiet tragedy of Derek's life is more compelling than some of the greatest dramas. If you're also a fan of Derek, you'll be glad to know that there still a lot more to come."},
{"title": "Recycling", "date": "Tuesday, October 12, 2010", "text": "Since I posted some images from an 1860s photograph album at the weekend, the number of daily hits has shot up, so I thought I'd spare the new visitors the effort of trawling through previous posts and give some of the highlights of this blog.I am a bookseller. I have spent most of my working life managing bookshops for chains like Ottakar's and Waterstone's, but last year, I was given the opportunity to set up a project selling pre-ISBN titles that had failed to sell in charity shops. Every day, thousands of books pass through my department and I regularly find things that have no financial value, but give a fascinating glimpse into the lives of others.Here are some of my favourite finds from the last year:This slip of paper fell out of an obscure 1940s novel. What does it mean? Is it one of those \"When the red swan flies over Moscow, there will be light snow\" coded messages that spies used to send to each other? I can't think of any other explanation.Someone commented that this picture looks as if it should be the cover image of a Smiths LP. I found it in an album of photographs of young British men doing their National Service in 1950s Hong Kong.There is a wonderful book called Boring Postcards, but few of the entries can compete with the sublime dullness of this card of a Catholic church in Western Australia. What possessed the makers to include the kitchen and toilets?This is the beginning of a letter from a woman to her doctor's surgery. I've no idea why it was used as a bookmark.This appeared in a programme for a village fete. Roy must be a remarkable man, but who is he?  Perhaps the answer is here:An odd photo and a fairly ghastly sofa. Surely this isn't where where Roy employs his healing hands?This is something terribly poignant about this photo, from the hideous soft furnishings to the open flap of the Dimplex heater, suggesting a lonely, out of season break, in a long-forgotten seaside resort. Is her enigmatic Mona Lisa smile there because she's leaving or just arrived?This was written in the back of an Orwell novel. If the National Service photo could be the cover of an album, this could be the title.During the last year I've developed a geeky interest in the 19th century colour printing processes, as I had no idea that the Victorians had the technology to produce things as beautiful as these plates. You can see more examples of Louis Hessem's art here.And there are more examples of Victorian colour here and here:I wonder if any of these books were read by this child:This rather haunting photo is one of several dozen from an album that features an Edwardian children's home.  It reminds me a little of one of my favourite films, The Amazing Mr Blunden.On the subject of children:They say that children are growing up too quickly these days, but this is ridiculous! Some commentators suggested that this is the length an adult will go to to win a competition.This is another rather strange image. I've no idea what it was doing as a bookmark in a rather dull textbook.I really like this photograph of a RAAF airman, particularly with the four girls in the background. It was taken in the Middle East in 1944. A blog reader later checked the airman's name and discovered that he survived the War and lived to a ripe old age.This photo looks like the cover image for a Penguin 2oth Century Classic. So does the picture below:I love even the most mundane images and during the last 18 months, have acquired a huge collection of photos.But I still get excited by the books. Particularly when they're 420 years old:It's a Bible, published only 120 years after William Caxton established his printing press. Like so many items, this also narrowly escaped being thrown in a skip. When I found it I began looking for key phrases from the King James version, completely oblivious to the fact that I'd found something even older.I have a whole drawer full of things that I've rescued from oblivion. But as far as I am concerned, they're only truly saved if they can be seen by others and it has been great to see how well people have responded to these occasionally sublime, but usually ridiculous finds.When I'm not blogging about random things that I find in books, I like to explore some of the more obscure corners of England - forgotten places like the Isle of Grain, or decommissioned nuclear bunkers. There are also posts about the darker side of Ladybird Books, the disturbing world of Candy and Andy and clips from some of the stranger films and television programmes of the 60s and 70s.But the posts that seem to have moved more people than any others (the 1860s photos excepted) are those featuring a local government officer called Derek, whose diaries appeared in my office after a house clearance and this post about a modern photograph album that I found in a box of books.I have no idea how long it will be until I find another item as interesting as last week's album of mid-Victorian photographs, but I'll continue to post anything I find that gives us tantalising glimpses into the forgotten lives of strangers.Thank you for visiting."},
{"title": "Almost Lost Forever", "date": "Saturday, October 09, 2010", "text": "Yesterday, someone at work came across a wonderful album of photos from the 1860s. They took one look and promptly threw it into a bin. Minutes later, a forklift truck was due to empty the bin's contents into a large skip, which would then be transported to a plant that pulped paper products and turned them into useful things, like lampshades and road surfacing material.Luckily, by sheer chance, somebody else was curious enough to pull the album out of the bin and when they saw the contents, they brought it straight to me. As soon as I opened the pages, I knew that this was an exceptional find.As with almost every album I find, there are no names or places, although judging by the stone walls and dales, I think that it comes from the north of England. There is only one date - 1863 - but even if there wasn't, the fashions are quite clearly mid-Victorian.This is the England of Charles Dickens, George Eliot and Wilkie Collins.I apologise in advance for posting so many photos - there are 30 - but the album contained such an embarrassment of riches, that it was very hard to produce a shortlist. I have done what I can to clean the images up on Photoshop, but some were in very poor condition. Nevertheless, even the grainiest or faintest photos have something about them that is fascinating.Yesterday, a unique collection of historic photos was almost destroyed forever. Today, thanks to the internet (and the keen-eyed person at work), it can be seen by people all over the world. I try not to think about how many other albums and diaries must have been consigned to oblivion.I'll let the photographs speak for themselves, except to say that the first image has the scariest-looking family I think I've ever seen:It's a little spooky to think that the old couple might have been born in the 18th century.P.S - As the response to this post has been so positive, I have acted on the advice of several people and created a Flickr page with these and some other photos from the album. You can find it here.Sam Jordison was right about the connection with the Lake District - when I showed the album to a friend, she spotted a faint pencil inscription that said Ambleside.It's great to see how many people have responded to these extraordinary photos. Within two days, the album has gone from near extinction to a worldwide audience and these forgotten lives have touched many people. What's so remarkable about the photographs is that although they are clearly staged, they feature a broad spectrum of subjects and give a real insight into mid-Victorian society."},
{"title": "The Unconsoled", "date": "Wednesday, October 06, 2010", "text": "Twelve years ago I was working in Slough. My daily commute to work involved a stop-start crawl along the most congested sections of the M25 and M4, culminating in the roundabout that appears in the intro sequence to The Office. It was a dark time.If someone had told me that one day my drive to work would take me through the South Downs to a road that hugged that coastline, I would have dismissed the idea as an impossible dream.But every weekday, that's what I do. Within five minutes of leaving my front door, I'm driving through beautiful countryside, listening to podcasts of Radio Four programmes, before the road suddenly turns south and takes me down to the English Channel. It's the best commute I've ever had, but to my great shame, within a fortnight of beginning my new route, I took it all completely for granted. These days I barely notice the sea.This evening, for the first time in ages, I actually noticed my surroundings and bothered to stop the car so that I could enjoy this:Seeing this view and comparing it to my time in Slough makes me frustrated at my lack of gratitude. Why do we get used to things so easily? Why the constant feeling of dissatisfaction?Perhaps I'm just being maudlin because it's been a bad month, full of financial worries and various life-changing decisions. It could be worse. At least I'm not working in Slough.Maybe I need to have a drink with this man:There. He's cheering me up right now. Just looking at that face, with its hail-fellow-well-met expression and twinkling eyes. Of course, he might have been a terrible bore. We'll never know.The mystery gentleman was one of several photos that were found in books during the last few days. Some were rather mundane pictures of babies and animals, but the majority were fascinating.Take this triptych, for example. There is a whole novel in these enigmatic images:The woman looks a bit of a femme fatale - I can see a literary novel with a bit of sauce.From one extreme to another, I also like this photo of a young nun in front of a fairly horrible, modern building:I didn't know that nuns had handbags. I wonder what's inside it?I've always been prepared to die for my country (illegal wars excepted), but I really couldn't stand the harsh physical training regime that accompanies military service, see it's nice to see a more \"portly\" gentleman playing such an important role in our coastal defences.This isn't the most interesting wedding photo that I've posted, but what interests me is that like all of the others, it features at least two people who look pretty miserable. What's that all about?I love these random photographs that fall out of books and now have a whole drawer full. But what I can't stand is the mystery. The best pictures give us tantalising hints and clues, but the puzzle will remain unsolved."},
{"title": "David Karp", "date": "Saturday, October 02, 2010", "text": "One of the great misconceptions about the internet is that it is some sort of gateway to the sum total of human knowledge. It isn't. Every day I come across writers who, judging by the number of reprints of their novels, were clearly popular in their lifetime. But Google their names and you'll be lucky if you find even the briefest of Wikipedia entries.One of the worst omissions is David Karp.Born in New York City in 1922, David Karp enlisted in the US Army when he was 20 and served in the Philippines and Japan. Four years later, he returned to New York and after completing his interupted education, worked as a continuity writer for a local radio station.In the early 1950s, Karp began to write fiction and published what came to be regarded as his \"breakthrough\" novel: One. It was a great critical success, acclaimed on both sides of the Atlantic.Cyril Connolly wrote: 'The publishers have bracketed this novel with \"Darkness at Noon\", \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", and \"Brave New World\", which I at first thought presumptious; but now, after reading it, I am inclined to agree. 'Published four years after Ninteen Eighty-Four, One seems to tread over similar ground, depicting the plight of an individual against a dystopian, collectivist state. However, Karp's future society is far more similar to ours than Orwell's Stalinist nightmare and the \"thought crimes\" are more nebulous. As a result, some readers have dismissed One as a derivative, watered-down version of Nineteen Eighty-Four.In my opinion, that is a mistake.Whether David Karp was or wasn't familiar with Orwell's masterpiece, One succeeds on its own terms and in some ways, Karp's superficially benign state is far more menacing than the histrionics of Big Brother.Take this exchange, for example:Burden paused, admiring this thin, intense young man. As he listened he was able to evoke the thoughts and feelings that had come over him during the interview with Frank Conger. 'Yes,' Burden said, 'it is quite correct. Not very polite of me, but hardly heretical. At least I see no heresy in it.''Let me go on with the first interview with Mr Frank Conger. Mr Conger, if you remember, seized on the word naive. He pursued it because it was a sort of danger signal to him.''Yes, I remember,' Burden said, wondering now if Conger was, after all as clumsy and stupid as he had thought. Evidently not. 'He tried to make you explain what you had meant by it, but you kept retreating, modifying what you had said, deprecating yourself further and further until you eventually wound up lying.''Lying?''When Conger pressed you to the point of finally admitting whether your work deserved an award or not and suggested that a realistic appraisal of your work indicated that you didn't feel you deserved an award - what did you say?''Well, I think I said something like - I guessed my work didn't deserve an award.'That was the lie,' Lark said, extending a skinny forefinger.'Yes,' Burden admitted honestly, seeing it now. 'I guess it was a lie. But you see, Conger kept at me so aggressively, trying to twist my words. Well, not twist, exactly. But to derive meanings from what I said - meanings I had no intention of -' Burden stopped abruptly, oddly blocked.One proves that you don't need perpetual war, videoscreens and Room 101 to create an atmosphere of menace. As a work of fiction, it is thoughtful, intelligent and utterly compelling, so why has it become almost completely forgotten whilst other dystopian novels like Fahrenheit 451 are still in print?Fortunately, some enlightened souls at Westholme Publishing have reissued David Karp's extraordinary novel and they have given me two copies to send to any reader of this blog (STOP PRESS: both copies have been snapped-up). Here's a link to the Amazon.com page.One is of one of three books that have been reprinted by Westholme Publishing who, to quote the publisher, are \"reissuing the book as part of our America Reads  series, dedicated to reprinting rediscovered books from key periods in  American history. This current group of three books reflects the 1950s  visions of the future at a time when the H-bomb and communism appeared  to threaten both the West and the future of humankind.\"If you like the book, spread the word: review it on Amazon, Twitter, Facebook and the blogosphere. If you don't, please report to the Department of Internal Examination at 3.00 on Wednesday, where we will discuss your negative attitudes and propose a programme of treatment.For previous blog entries about David Karp, click here, here and here. Unfortunatelty, there is very little information about David Karp on the internet, in spite of his screenwriting credentials. There are lots of pages about two other David Karps, one of whom founded Tumblr, but the most important David Karp languishes in obscurity. That needs to change."},
{"title": "The Young Delinquent", "date": "Wednesday, September 29, 2010", "text": "I found a wonderful book today, written by Cyril Burt. Written in 1925, \"The Young Delinquent\" is packed full of the latest cutting edge research on criminal behaviour in the young.It also has some very helpful photographs to show the reader what these ne'er-do-wells look like:This young man was clearly a bad sort. The lack of a cravat and cigarette holder single him out as a member of the criminal classes.As for this brazen hussy, I can only hope that she was taken in hand by member of the clergy and shown the path to righteousness. But what makes a sweet, rosy-cheeked child turn into a hardened recidivist?Sir Cyril researched the subject of criminal behaviour in the young for many years and codified his research into a sociological equivalent of the Periodic Table:If you click to enlarge, you'll see that some of the contributing factors include illegitimacy, incorrigibility and being Belgian. On another page, Burt devaites from the received wisdom of contemporary criminology and blames delinquency on \"Excessive local facilities for amusement\". 85 years on, it all seems patently ridiculous. However in 1925, Cyril Burt's apparently exhaustive research, backed up with pseudo-scientific tables and photographic evidence, must have seemed pretty impressive.You only have to look at this lad to know that he's going to be trouble:These two girls have been sent to a reform school, but has it done them any good?Yes and no.It's interesting to see that people were fretting over the same issues nearly a century ago, looking for easy answers to complicated questions.As for Mr Burt, he went on to become Sir Cyril and was recognised as one of the leading educational psychologists of his day. There is an interesting article about him here.In the meantime, we should avoid exposing Belgians to an excess of leisure facilities, otherwise all hell might break loose."},
{"title": "More Forgotten Lives", "date": "Tuesday, September 28, 2010", "text": "Why did so many people use photographs as bookmarks? Until I started my current job, I assumed that the majority of bookmarks were a mixture of shop-bought \"proper\" ones, bus or train tickets, shopping receipts and scraps of paper. But no, they're nearly all photos.I'm not complaining. I love opening a book and finding a random picture of a complete stranger, particularly when they have a cigarette hanging out of their mouth and are sitting on a ridiculously small horse:The small animals theme continues with this lady in a rather festive hat:I have no idea who these gentlemen are; they have a dark, Celtic look about them. As for their regalia, I wonder if it is Masonic - are these the famous aprons?To return to the small animals theme...The man is the spitting image of my great-uncle, Jack. He had a very strong Kentish accent and always sounded as if he had part of a Chelsea bun in his mouth. He made roll-ups with a little machine and once lit, he would puff away and slowly regale us with anecdotes that were, in hindsight, mind-numbingly dull.But because I was only a child and he had the poise and confidence of a great raconteur, I assumed that my failure to find Uncle Jack interesting was a mark of my immaturity.The bridegroom reminds me of a very advanced humanoid life-form in the 1950s science fiction film This Island Earth. With a forehead like that, he must have a very big brain, so I can only asume that his anecdotes were more interesting than my Uncle Jack's."},
{"title": "Derek's Last Chance", "date": "Saturday, September 25, 2010", "text": "If you are new to this blog, click here, here, here, here, here and here to understand the background to this post.1986 appears to have been a watershed year for Derek. It begins on a positive note, with Brenda's cantankerous mother finally dispatched to an old people's home. Derek and Brenda had waited for this moment for years, but in spite of this the spark of passion doesn't appear to have been reignited and the procession of migraines, aches and mysterious viruses continue unabated:'My whole system creaks and groans; aches fill me; my head faintly throbs. Yet I have been out for an hour digging the garden. I had company: a blackbird. He was obviously in search of worms in the soil I was turning over, but though he came close, he had not the courage to stay close so that he might have had a whole feast. Men are like that.I have felt somewhat wild today, have spent much of my time making foolish remarks and generally annoying people. I think my chemical imbalance has something to do with it, for while making a fool of myself, I KNEW that I was, but seemed unable to calm my inward turbulence.'In fairness, Derek has many worries. Now in their mid-50s, Derek and Brenda are struggling to live on his salary as a local government officer. The diaries contain several letters from Derek's bank, including this rather chatty one, which was written in response to a lengthy epistle from Derek:'Dear Mr -,I thank you for your letter of the 12 August and would commiserate with you insomuch as NALGO have seen fit to turn down your rise of 6% and that indeed others of your union appear to wish for a sum which must surely in this day and age be unobtainable. I feel I ought not to continue in this vein as I feel that bankers like publicans should not get involved in discussing politics or religion with their customers. Unfortunately although you have stated you have got that point out of your hair, it is something which I find I cannot as most of mine has disappeared over the last 15 years or so!Turning now to the mundane matter of banking and its relationship to your account, it would appear that were I to mark the overdraft limit on your account of £400, the present limit, for a period of three months, it would give you time to gather the harvest and review your finances.'Derek does his best to live frugally, selling books and turning his garden into a mini-allotment, but the sums still don't add up. Under normal circustances, Brenda might have been able to get a full-time job, but she has a son to look after:And this innocuous drawing becomes heartbreakingly poignant once you realise that the son was 24 years old when he drew this.But it is not all doom and gloom. In the spring, Derek and Brenda have an idyllic break in Dartmoor with their son:'We drove on over the moors, delighting in their austere grandeur. We would have liked to climb up a tor or two, but had run out of energy. Anyway, once we got to Ashburton, our strength came back and I was able to spend a happy hour in the bookshop there, acquainting myself fully with the stock.We had expected to meet much traffic on the motorway, but found it almost deserted. Brenda suggested that the fear of radiation fallout was keeping people indoors. Anyway, we were able to maintain a steady speed all the way home, which meant that we got in an hour earlier than we expected. It is good to be back with books about me and music. And space as well. And it is good to have just the three of us.'The fallout was, of course, from Chernobyl:'Radiation fear is strong in the land, but since there is little we can do in a practical way beyond consuming iodine tablets, I take little congnizance of the fear. The leaves on the trees are still as bright as they appear; the birds still sing; the traffic thunders by; and all this shall pass. On the coach travelling to work yesterday morning I was struck by the thought that the Saints shall \"inherit\" the earth, which implies that it will have to be cleaned and cleared and made anew before the Owner shall give it to them.'Around this time, a glimmer of hope appears, when Derek's boss anounces his retirement. Having worked closely with Mr Sumpter for many years, Derek is the natural candidate to replace him.  Perhaps this is the answer to Derek's prayers.Full of hope, Derek submits his application and, a few weeks later, is invited for an interview:'Well, I had my interview for Mr Sumpter's post this morning. It was scheduled for an hour and lasted for one hour and three quarters. There were four other contenders: a man from Lancashire, a man from Gloucester and a man from Rochdale. I was first through the door; and since half past eleven this morning have been waiting for a sign, the motion of a hand, a small telephone call that will announce \"Yea\" or \"Nay\". And the longer the silence lasts, the more sure I am that the post is not to be mine.I have torment of mind and desolation of heart, for promotion is one thing, and the feeling of worthlessness if it does not come is something else.We are having a year of disappointments. Our debts hang round our necks like albatrosses; and I am most strongly aware of having been passed over when it comes to assisting with the history of the church in this land. If only one was sure that heaven draws closer.'Two days later, Derek learns that he has not been appointed as Mr Sumpter's replacement:'Well, all my worst fears have come true. So sure was I that Mr Sumpter's post would not be mine, that I tossed and turned upon my bed all Wednesday night. When I got to work, no sign came, so I phoned Bob Sanders and after a brief hesitation, he told me that the man from Lancashire had got the job. I knew it would be him. The Spirit of the Lord whispered to my spirit most powerfully, the first time his name was mentioned, that he would take the job. Bob said that all the interviews were good, but the panel felt that he had the most to offer when it came to solving the problems rife at the office. This implies that they felt that I was part of the problem; and perhaps I am. For my defence of Mr Sumpter has not gone well with the Insprectorate.When I told Mr Sumpter of the decision, he turned haggard and grey. I thought he would weep; he was certainly extremely angry and he cried out \"They do not know you!  They do not know you!\" He feels that his bad management is to blame and that by putting me in a position where I felt obliged to defend him, he shattered my chances. But I do not feel this is true. I feel the Lord has something else in mind.'I can't help feeling that Derek's feelings about Mr Sumpter are more ambivalent than he suggests in this extract. But perhaps it is also tempting to blame his failure on the positive virtues of his loyalty to Mr Sumpter, rather than dwell on any personal shortcomings?'I have received sympathy from many of the staff. As one put it, \"Better the devil we know..!\". Anne Snagge  was particularly upset, as was Shirley James. Kind of them.The pain was great on Thursday. I was in torment, feeling again the terrible worthlessness, the feeling of the last chance gone. Hell it was, and just as keen. But I have got my second wind now; and we eat and have a roof over our heads; we have great friends. And I am still quite the best off of the Saints in the ward. And the Lord stands by me. The test is his.Brenda has been much tried by this blow. She is desperately worried by our debts and the fact that they are overtaking our income.'A few months later, Mr Sumpter officially retires and Derek attends his retirement party:'The food was excellent. Breaded chicken legs; pizza; pate; nuts; and a cake made by Mr Sumpter's wife in the form of a crossword puzzle. The icing was excellent, but the cake itself was rather dry for my taste.As for the entertainment, Shirley and I did several short \"telephone calls\" demonstrative of the variations of John's surname. I wrote the script and it seemed to be a howling success, as were the two poems I had written for the occasion.I then made a few remarks, and we presented a set of binoculars to Mr Sumpter, the pack of Mintoes from Callard and Bowser (a total surprise to him), and a large bottle of champagne. A pot of South African violets was given to his wife.Wine flowed freely, but Mr Sumpter had bought me a large bottle of pure grape juice, and I was surprised at the number of other people keen to try it. Shirley James had never had Shloer before. How sheltered can you be?I was at home just before half-past-seven to an empty house. I fed the bunnies and gave one of them a half-hour run up and down the hall. The other was asleep in its bed so I did not disturb him.'Derek is now 56 and as he wrote earlier, feels that his \"last chance\" to advance his career has gone and in a sense, he is right. A few years later he will seek early retirement on the grounds of ill health.With no immediate hope of paying off their growing overdraft, Derek and Brenda sit down one Friday evening and decide to sell the house. From Derek's writings, it is clear that he loves his home, particularly his library, with its books and classical records. This must have been a very hard decision to make.But then suddenly, out of the blue, everything changes:Brenda has been awarded an Invalid Care Allowance in keeping with the recent decision of the European Court of Appeal. This is an allowance made to women who are prevented from working by the need to look after a handicapped member of their family. The allowance has been back-dated to December 1984, so Brenda has been sent a cheque for £2391.75. This now enables us to pay off our overdraft; and for Brenda to put a large sum in her building society book. What a blessing! She promptly went out and bought some trousers and a pair of black shoes.'The year ends with Derek and his family watching a video of \"Back to the Future\":'A good plot, plenty of laughs, and sharp dialogue. But the old problem reared its head again: pointless, grating blasphemy. Why will these producers do it. Another film ruined.'"},
{"title": "The 1970s Home", "date": "Tuesday, September 21, 2010", "text": "Yesterday afternoon, two wedding photos dropped out of a hardback compilation of a 1970s DIY magazine called Golden Homes. I'm not sure when the photos were taken, but I'd guess the late 1960s.Here are the happy couple:My wife's first reaction to this photo was one of utter horror: \"It's her wedding day and she hasn't got any make-up on!\" The bridegroom and bride remind me of my parents who were, to put it politely, an \"older couple\" and had both given up hope of ever getting married until suddenly, Cupid struck in the somewhat unpromising environment of the National Savings Bank headquarters in Kew. After a whirlwind courtship of four years, my parents got married. I appeared almost exactly nine months later.I wonder if the mystery couple - let's call them Roy and Mary - actually used their copies of Golden Homes magazine to \"improve\" their new house and give it a more contemporary look. If they did, here are some of the designs they might have used:We all know what a wonderful colour orange is for living rooms and it's even better with a few zigzag stripes to add a bit of interest:This is just the sort of room you'd want to relax in after a hard day's work and as a counterpoint to the orange, why not add an integrated bookcase and music centre?This bedroom is probably more suited to bachelor pads, with its Mike Gambit-style dark colours:As for the exterior, bricks are so drab. Why not brighten the outside up (and protect your walls from the elements) with this bright, cheery stone-cladding? Lovely.We will never know whether Roy and Mary acted on the advice of Golden Homes, but I like to imagine them reclining in the black leather chairs of their orange living room, watching Nationwide:"},
{"title": "Sir Philip Gibbs", "date": "Sunday, September 19, 2010", "text": "\"If I have learned anything it is that  pity is more intelligent than hatred, that mercy is better than  justice, that if one walks around the world with friendly eyes one makes  good friends.\"You  may already be familiar with the name of Philip Gibbs, but until I  started working with secondhand books, I had never heard of him. That  isn't unusual. Every day I handle hundreds of titles by authors whose  names have disappeared from the collective memory of readers, but Gibbs  wasn't just any writer.It is hard to convey how famous Philip  Gibbs was. In some ways he was the David Frost of his day, whose reputation as a journalist was equalled by few. Confided in by presidents, prime ministers and monarchs, the mere mention of his name opened doors that were closed to others.It  is difficult to write even a very potted biography of Philip Gibbs, as he  led such a long and eventful life, spanning a period that began with  George Eliot publishing Daniel Deronda and ended a few months before  the Beatles' first No.1 hit. However, here is a brief outline:Born in 1877, to a family that he later described as belonging to the \"shabby genteel middle class\",  Gibbs grew up  in south London with his four brothers and two sisters.  The children were all educated at home, partly for financial reasons,  but also because Gibbs' father regarded public schools as \"Horrible dens of bullying and brutality.\"By  the time he had reached adolescence, Gibbs knew that he wanted to earn  his living from writing. At 16, he had his first article published, in  the Daily Chronicle. At 18, he  got his first job, working for the publisher Cassell. He was just an  office boy, but a chance encounter with the managing director H. O. Arnold-Foster  led to a commission for what would become Gibbs' first book, Founders of the Empire.At 21, Gibbs was married and keen to pursue a career in journalism. A stint at the Bolton Evening News  soon opened the door to Fleet Street and his reputation slowly began to  grow. But it was one story in particular which sealed Gibbs'  reputation, when he exposed the American explorer Dr Frederick Cook's claim to have reached the North Pole as fraudulent.During  the First World War, Philip Gibbs was one of only five official war  correspondents and his work during this period earned him a knighthood.  It was a life-changing experience. Gibbs was appalled by the  incompetence of the military and waste of human life. After listening to  Gibbs describe the situation at the Front, Prime Minister Lloyd George  remarked that \"if people really knew, the war would be stopped tomorrow.\"But  people didn't know. The official censors made sure that Gibbs'  dispatches were heavily edited and the reading public were protected  from the full horrors of trench warfare and the largely futile attempts  to break the military stalemate. After the First World War, Gibbs had  his revenge. In Now It Can Be Told, Gibbs launched a blistering attack on the military and made a plea for diplomacy to replace warfare, with all disputes mediated by the League of nations.A  liberal by nature who, in addition to his anti-war views, had also been  a keen supporter of the suffragettes, Philip Gibbs was a controversial  figure at times. But his prominence opened many doors and in the 1920s,  he became the first journalist to interview the Pope (Gibbs was a Catholic, which must have helped).By the time  of his death in 1962, Philip Gibbs was one of the most well-known writers of  his day. He left a huge body of work, consisting of over 40 novels and  around a dozen non-fiction books, which  in their day were bestsellers.  So why has his name been forgotten?It could be argued  that Gibbs' obscurity says more about the ephemeral nature of journalism  than his gifts as a writer. But George Orwell didn't suffer the same  fate, so perhaps Gibbs' books just weren't that good.During the last few months I've read two works by Philip Gibbs: a novel called Blood Relations and an autobiography called The Pageant of the Years. Both books were flawed, but highly enjoyable reads. Neither book deserves to be out of print.Blood Relations  is a story of love and war.  The novel begins in Oxford, shortly before  the First World War, and introduces a German aristocrat - Count Paul von Arnsberg - who has just graduated from Heidelberg and wishes to  continue his education in Britain. At first, the English students are  amused by his stolid, Teutonic manners and relentlessly earnest approach  to life, but gradually they warm to Count Paul and when the term ends, he is invited to stay in rural Surrey (not an oxymoron in  those days) with the family of a friend, Edward Middleton.During  the visit, von Arnsberg falls in love with Edward's sister Audrey and a  few months later they marry. Their honeymoon is spent touring Europe and  everything appears idyllic, but when Gibbs ends a chapter with the  sentence, \"It was very gay in Vienna in May of 1914\", we know where the  narrative is heading.At this point, the novel really takes off.  Audrey is trapped in Germany, living with Paul's family, while her husband is at the front fighting  the very men who were, only a year earlier, his friends. It is a  compelling story and, although it could be argued that the characters  are rather stereotyped, Gibbs' even-handed approach to the combatants  and his vivid descriptions of the reality of modern warfare make a  refreshing change to the jingoistic, bellicose works of some of his  contemporaries.But this isn't just a war novel. In some ways,  the most interesting part of the narrative is the latter part, which  describes what happened to Germany after the Treaty of Versailles. Gibbs  isn't subtle. He clearly (and prophetically) feels that the financial  penalties placed on Germany can only lead to ruin. In this sense Blood Relations  is more of a polemic than a completely successful work of fiction.However, the  author's intimate knowledge of trench warfare and 1920s Germany make  this a compelling read and the narrative moves along at a good pace. I particularly liked the way the that Gibbs  enables the reader to view the First World War through German eyes.Overall, I loved Blood Relations and I'm sure that, in the right hands, this novel would make a fantastic film.As  for Gibbs' autobiography, it is a highly enjoyable read, but lacks the  necessary combination of confessional introspection and shameless  bitchiness of the greatest memoirs. Reading The Pageant of the Years  is like meeting a very amiable gentleman who regales you with a  succession of amusing anecdotes, but afterwards you realise that he has  told you very little about himself.  The nearest Gibbs comes to dishing  the dirt is a subtle insinuation that Marie Corelli pinched his  sandwiches at the coronation of George V.Nevertheless, for all its shortcomings as a memoir, it is a highly entertaining read and I would recommend The Pageant of the Years to  anyone who is interested in 20th-century history. Alongside his  recollections of life as a correspondent in both wars, I was  particularly fascinated by Gibbs' eyewitness account of the terrible  famine in Russia, during the early days of the Soviet Union:\"In one village I remember we had as  our guide a tall, middle-aged peasant. When he spoke of the famine in  all those villages he struck his breast and tears came into his eyes. He  led us into timbered houses where Russian families were hibernating and  waiting for death. There was one family I saw who left an indelible  mark on my mind. The father and mother were lying on the floor when we  entered and were almost too weak to rise. Some young children were on a  bed above a stove, dying of hunger. A boy of eighteen lay back in a  wooden settle against the window sill in a kind of coma. These people  had nothing to eat - nothing at all.\"I was also touched by this recollection of a meeting with Ramsay MacDonald, when he was Prime Minister:\"One day after another lunch...he  drove me back in his car to the House of Commons. There was a detective  sitting in front with the driver but we had a glass screen between us  and could talk privately. 'My dear Philip,' he said suddenly, 'I  am a broken man. I can't put two sentences together, and I can't put  two ideas together. I am blind, and old, and useless.'He grasped my hand and clung to it,  like a small boy needing comfort and my heart was filled with pity for  him, and I was stirred by the poignancy of this tragedy. But when I left  him I was disturbed by the thought that a man in this state of mind and  body should be Prime Minister at such a time in our history.\"Gibbs  was no Orwell, but he was a good journalist who lived a remarkable life  and the best of his writing - the earlier novels like the semi-autobiographical Street of Adventure  (which used to be required reading for anyone contemplating a career in  journalism) and his works of non-fiction - deserve to survive.What I find most surprising is that nobody has written a biography of  Philip Gibbs. From a biographer's point of view, the raw materials of  Gibbs' life offer an embarrassment of riches. Here is a man who was born  in the middle of the Victorian age, in a world without cars, telephones  or cinema. When Gibbs died, the Space Age had already begun.Sir Philip Gibbs travelled extensively, witnessing some of the most  momentous events of the 20th century at first hand and meeting many of  the people who were responsible for them. In his writing, he always  comes across as a man who is seeking to understand and convey the whole  picture, rather than reinforce any preconceived ideas.Once a household name, today Philip Gibbs is largely forgotten. This is a  great pity, as everything I've read by and about him suggests that  Gibbs was a remarkable individual, whose compassion and loyalty earned him many friends. As far as his work is concerned,  perhaps the sum is greater than its parts - he didn't seal his  reputation with a masterpiece - but it more than deserves a new  generation of readers."},

It's bad news for the bookmark industry, but very good news for the blogosphere.Here is a small selection of photographic bookmarks from the last two days:Here we see a fine, upstanding British family from the early 1960s, in front of their Ford Anglia. Although they are on holiday, Father wouldn't be seen dead without his tweed suite, matching cap, brown brogues and club tie. It would also be unthinkable for David to appear in public without his uniform.But something terrible happened to this family. They discovered modern jazz and everything changed:The country casuals and school uniform have been replaced by polo neck sweaters, dark glasses and semi-nudity.

Perhaps it is. Somebody is on the bridge, looking down at him.A group shot from the 1962 military manoeuvres of the Women's Institute, shortly before they decided to abandon violence.

{"title": "Yesterday in London", "date": "Sunday, September 12, 2010", "text": "The BBC weather forecast predicted rain on London Bridge today, so I left my umbrella at home and set off for the Mayor's Thames Festival, looking forward to an afternoon of al fresco drinking with some old friends from university.Although I generally prefer peace and quiet when travelling by train, there's something infectious about the excitement of people travelling up to London on a Saturday. Everyone seems to be in a good mood, unlike the funereal atmosphere of a weekday commuter train, where the only sounds are the clicking of laptop keypads and the chimes of incoming text messages.After finding a seat, I looked at my fellow passengers. In the seats in front of mine, two young men were playing a game of poker, with their cards spread out across the four-seater table. At Haywards Heath the carriage suddenly filled and an old couple asked the young men to make room. I thought I felt I felt a slight frisson of tension, but five minutes later the old man had joined in the game (which he won) and the woman was talking about going to rock concerts. By the time the train had reached Clapham Junction, they all were on first-name terms.I never really pay much attention to Victoria, but today I noticed how clean it was compared to the shabby, depressed railway stations of my childhood. Now that we're living in \"austerity Britain\", will we enter a new era of flaking paintwork and broken vending machines?I met my friends on Southwark Bridge, which had been closed to traffic and filled with long tables, stalls selling organic food and - at the far end - some bales of hay and two cows. Having just spent a week surrounded by dairy cattle, it was weird seeing people making such a fuss of the cows, as if they were exotic beasts being presented to a medieval court.Southwark Bridge was packed and at first glance, there seemed to be a cosmopolitan crowd from all over the world. However, it was an illusion. No matter where people had come from, they all appeared to be from the liberal, left-of-centre middle classes. As I walked through the crowds I heard the same words over an over, like an incantation:\"Organic...natural...chorizo...vegetarian...authentic... unpasteurised...vegan...Fairtrade...\"Rural Britain had apparently come to London, but there were no ruddy-faced men in Barbours or women in tweed skirts with wicker baskets, let alone machines spraying pesticides on the stalls of vegetables. I'm not complaining. As a closet hippie with more than one Pentangle track on my MP3 player, I loved it. The Mayor's Thames Festival gave us a brief glimpse of how London could be if we swapped cars for cows.I found my friends sitting in the middle of the bridge, drinking perry. Within minutes, we had reverted to the highly intellectual level of debate that we enjoyed at university and the topics covered included the following: ELO vs Sailor, what percentage of the population were sexually arousing (as opposed to just attractive), the South West music scene (Portishead vs The Wurzels), the XX, which countries had the ugliest people and whether William Hague really was gay. We had been drinking.In between talking nonsense, I managed to film a few clips on Southwark Bridge. You can briefly hear my friends discussing the pressing issues of the day:These days I spend most of my time pretending to be grown-up and sensible, so it is a welcome relief to have absurd conversations with people I've know since my teens. I shall be back there in 2011."},

It was both cheap and, more importantly, in an idyllic setting.This was the view from our bedroom window:Admittedly, you have to like the sounds of church bells, cows mooing and the scuttling of harvest mice in the rafters at night to fully appreciate this gîte. There were also rather a lot of insects. However, in between the bells and the moos, it was incredibly quiet.I'll refrain from a dull travelogue. I visited the usual tourist sites: Mont St Michel, Bayeux and the D-Day beaches, including the remains of the artificial harbour at Arromanches:I also discovered some beautiful churches, many of which were eerily quiet. In spite of its town centre location, the Eglise Saint-Pierre in Coutances was completely deserted:As for Mont St Michel, it was depressingly commercialised, with a mixture of countless gift shops selling hideous souvenirs and overpriced cafes staffed by surly waiters. At 9.00 in the morning it was tolerable, but by 11.00 the narrow alleys were packed with people, all pushing in different directions. On my way out, I saw a forlorn-looking woman sitting in a wheelchair, abandoned by her companions.But in spite of everything, it was a magical place that, like Venice, made me feel as if I had stumbled into a fairy tale. The view from the top was particularly awe-inspiring:But what impressed me most of all was Normandy itself. It wasn't just the beautiful landscape, empty roads, lack of police cars, rich history or absence of fat people (how do the French maintain their figures on red meat and cheese?) that appealed. It wasn't even the fact that in today's so-called globalized age, hardly anyone spoke English. I think what I particularly valued was the different attitude to living.President Sarkozy has repeatedly urged the French to become more like the Americans and British, but it we who should be more like them. We should close our shops on Saturday afternoons, take long lunches, drink red wine, have affairs, discuss philosophy in cafes, go on strike, wear Printemps instead of Primark, take our children out to lunch, subsidise unpopular art and start smoking again.I have been back for less than a day, but I've already booked next year's trip."},

On every other page, Derek records that he has a cold or headache. Unfortunately, Brenda and the children don't seem to have fared much better, with of constant succession of minor ailements.It is hardly suprising that Derek and Brenda suffered from so many largely psychosomatic illnesss. Aside from the stresses of raising a mentally handicapped child, they spent many years living with Brenda's mother, who comes across as a rather poisonous individual. Derek was clearly a frustrated man who dreamed of being a writer, but was very candid about his own mediocrity. Derek's passions were dampened down by his sense of duty, but resurfaced as minor ailments.We begin with Derek suffering from existential angst:Life  is very ordinary at the moment. We sleep; we rise up; we work; we  return again; we sit and fall asleep in front of the television; and the  evenings draw in earlier by the night; and we retire to bed again.Today  I ate my tea - salad surrounding chicken nibbles, followed by banana  and chocolate custard. As I did so, I watched an early Tarzan film on  television: \"Tarzan Triumps,\" a weird sort of film made to inspire  patriotism in young Americans during the war years. Weismuller had great  lines: \"Where Boy? Boy gone? Now Tarzan make war!\"If I had my  way, I would always take The Times or the Daily Telegraph. But Brenda  finds them rather too heavy for her taste, hence most times I get the  Daily Mail. This, of course, has some excellent articles in it,  particularly those by Paul Johnson and Lynda Lee-Potter. However, some  of its items are rather too frenetic, others are untrustworthy, and its  blue politics too overt for my taste.While preparing Richard's  bath this morning, I was pondering on the division of the earth in the  days of Shem and Peleg. It seemed to me that if one were to prepare a  jigsaw of those parts of the earth that fitted together and stuck them  so, the space must be left where the city of Enoch used to be. I ran  downstairs to put this theory to Brenda. She assessed its faults as a  workable model in about three minutes. She pointed out that some parts  of the earth had glided over others; others had been thrust up as  mountain chains; yet others were uplifted seabed. Ergo, fitting the  parts would not be possible, only in a limited way because of techtonic  plate movement. So, back to my ponderings I go. Facts are always getting  in the way!Well, the only fool about today was me. I was full of hyperenergy, kept  making stupid remarks and in many respects must have appeared most  childish to the members of the staff at the office. Still, I have  enjoyed myself; and Shirley Jones remarked in the moment of my attempted  repentance that they much preferred me foolish, since it livened up the  place a bit. But still, what sort of Priesthood holder is it that spends  time making a fool of himself when the solemnities of eternity ought to  be resting on his mind?Amanda Wilmington gave an excellent talk. Her clarity of voice is a  delight to listen to; and her material is quite novel in a young lady of  her age. She is due to have an operation on her jaw soon since it is  rather too large for her face. Once that is done, she will be an  attractive young lady with much to give.I walked down to Nanna's flat to deliver some colostomy bags to her. I  had picked these up earlier from the hospital, where I had asked for  some \"sunshine\" bags, Nanna's pet term for  them. They boggled somewhat,  so I explained myself; and when I left, bags in hand, they were of the  opinion that sunshine bags was a more descriptive term, particularly  since the bags are bright yellow in colour! When I got home again, the  Spirit came upon me most powerfully.I took my route up the High Street, and at its end there was a group of  lads and girls in black leather jackets and leggings, several of them  drunk, singing and carousing through the crowds and shouting vile abuse  at car drivers; for the group took no care of the pedestrian crossing  lights. I prayed to the Lord that the day might rapidly come when such  scenes would pass away from the earth, and it would be people with men  and women of sobriety and peace.I thought I would be free of needing to follow them once we reached the  Centre, but they took their own way down the same road. When I got  inside my gate and turned to latch it, one of them turned and bawled  \"What are you looking at, you f...... s......?\" Not the sort of remark  to stay and answer. And that is the great question: why do the sons of  Satan always have a strong build? One never suffers abuse nor evil from  little men whom one could flatten. Curious...Recently my family has made me increasingly aware of the irritation  caused by my tapping away at the typewriter keys when I am at home.  Perhaps it is time for me to return to writing out my entries? That  would be much harder, and somewhat of an intellectual grindstone since  my thoughts seem to flow more freely through a keyboard...A year or so later, Derek seems to have bowed to popular demand and gave up typing his diaries. Sadly, the last few journals - handwritten in exercise books - were thrown away by someone in the warehouse where I work, but I do remember reading about a trip to the Holy Land, which must have been a major event in Derek's life (particularly as he never seemed to travel abroad).In spite of his relatively good health, Derek was able to retire early on grounds of ill health, thanks to a sympathetic doctor. A diary from 1989 shows that Derek appears to have enjoyed life after work, joining a creative writing course at the local adult education college.After that, Derek's life is a mystery. I would love to know how the story ended."},

My argument -  \"But this is Cambridge!\" failed to impress anyone.I  don't know what all the fuss was about. My sons seemed quite happy  converting the railings of King's College into an army assault course,  although my attempts to engage their attention by comparing every  ancient buiding to Harry Potter were a dismal failure. They knew exactly  what I was up to.I  could have happily spent a whole day exploring the colleges (and next  time I'll leave the boys at home and do just that). I thought that  Trinity College was particularly beautiful:But  what particularly impressed me was the beauty of the people. This must  be the place where all those embracing 'A' level girls with lustrous  hair went. For a moment, I stood and contemplated the juxtaposition of  the stunning medieval architecture and beautiful women whizzing past on  bicycles. Could anywhere this perfect really exist?If I hadn't been so incompetent at finding the correct \"Park and Ride\"  bus stop, I would have probably left with a misty-eyed impression of  Cambridge, but we boarded the wrong bus and what should have been a  five-minute journey became an hour-long odyssey around the ring roads  and back streets of the city. I saw grafitti-ridden underpasses, bland  industrial estates and cheap, badly designed modern housing. It was a  revelation.At some point everyone except us got off the bus and  as we travelled further away from the city, I wondered where we were  going to end up. Then I noticed a familiar-looking row of pebble-dashed  houses with satellite dishes, followed by the appallingly-designed Crown  Court. We were back.I have seen more of Cambridge than I ever  thought I would. The centre is breathtakingly beautiful, but like so  many other cities, it is surrounded by a ring of 20th century ugliness.  In a recent radio programme, someone remarked that one of the best  things about the recession was that a lot of building projects have had  to be scrapped.It's a shame to think like that.

Thanks to Sam, the cult of Derek has increased tenfold and I predict that by the middle of the century, he'll have more followers than the Church of the SubGenius.In the Guardian blog article, Sam writes: \"Marginalia and forgotten mementoes are often squirreled away inside  conventional books. What will become of such treasures in the age of the  ebook?\"In spite of my day job, I'm not completely against ebooks. I can see that they make sense if you're a student who needs several dozen weighty textbooks, or a Dan Brown fan who consumes a couple of paperback thrillers a week during the commute to work. Not all books are sacred. Disposable books are well-suited to an ephemeral medium.However, the books that you care about - the ones you hope to read again and pass on to your loved ones (who will then give them to me), should be printed on paper. Bookworms, mildew and acid notwithstanding, books last - particularly the older ones. Kindles are vulnerable. They depend on an infrastructure that provides electricity and transmits and decodes digital information. Can we automatically assume that this infrastructure will continue to exist? Will our civilisation become the first one in human history to endure?Just to be on the safe side, let's keep printing books on paper.My work involves sifting though thousands of charity shop rejects in search of titles that are worth selling. In the last year I've found a 1590 Bible, a signed first edition of Siegfried Sassoon's \"War Poems\" and copy of \"What Katy Did Next\" signed, somewhat improbably, by Enid Blyton. It's amazing what people throw away.However, even more than the books, I love the ephemera that I find in them: photographs, pressed flowers, letters, a 1930s London Underground ticket, a list of rules for borrowing library books aimed at the \"labouring classes\", a Wartime guide to growing your own vegetables, or an enigmatic message scrawled on a book's endpaper that says \"Nothing you say will set the house ablaze\".Each item, however trivial, is a tantalising piece of evidence from a forgotten life. I'm fully aware of the irony of praising the virtues of the printed page on a blog, but the two mediums can be complementary and I love the fact that the internet allows me share things that would otherwise have been lost.Like this:This is a novel from the 1970s, written by a man with the wonderful name of Percival Skedgell. You won't have heard of it because there is only one copy in existence. If the ebook is at one end of the spectrum, this unique, handwritten novel is about as far as you can go in the other direction.I've no idea how good the novel is, as the handwriting is so small that I feel like Donald Pleasance in The Great Escape. However, it looks like a fantasy novel - not my favourite genre, but I am intrigued.The book is a work of art, painstakingly written and bound (let's ignore the odd Tip-ex mark), with hundreds of pages of text. Amazingly, it was almost thrown away.And who is, or was, Percival Skedgell? I have found one reference to him on the Coventry University alumni website:\"The second oldest in my class was Percival Skedgell at 25, from Dartmoor.

After its close encounter with oblivion, Percival Skedgell's book has been reunited with a member of his family.When was the last time you saw a car sticker that made you think \"Hmm, I'd really like to get to know that person\"?I particularly hate all of the variations of the Baby on Board stickers: \"Little Princess on Board\", \"Cheeky Monkey on Board\" etc, although I did like one that said \"Babe on Board\", particularly when I pulled alongside and saw a rather plain teenage girl with severe acne sitting behind the wheel.If I had my way, I'd ban 90% of car stickers. No more \"I'm the bitch in front of you\" or a picture of a Liverpool fan urinating on an Everton football shirt. In my Stalinist state, I would only allow tha proletariat a choice of five car stickers:The National TrustI've Seen the Lions at LongleatWoburn AbbeyA choice of BBC local radio stationsAA/RACI think that's more than enough. Party members would,of course, be allowed to have their own stickers, but these would have to be genuinely witty or beautiful.

{"title": "The Idyllic World of Peter and Jane", "date": "Sunday, August 15, 2010", "text": "On Friday I found an old Ladybird Peter and Jane book. As soon as I opened it, I was taken back to a day when my parents solemnly announced that I was going to learn to read, as if it was an unpleasant medical procedure that had to be endured. I protested, but they wouldn't listen and silently, we got in my dad's clapped-out Ford Prefect and drove to \"The Christian Bookshop\" in Richmond.We returned home with a Ladybird book and I began to read for the first time: \"This is Peter. This is Jane. This is Peter and Jane. Peter likes Jane. Jane likes Peter...\" It wasn't the most exciting narrative, but it did the job.Even at the age of five, I could see that the late 1950s/early 60s illustrations belonged to another world. Listening to threads of my parents' conversations, it seemed to have once been a real world, but was destroyed when young men decided to grow their hair longer. I couldn't understand why it should be bad to have hair like Jesus, but I accepted that I wasn't being told everything.If you're not familiar with the idyllic world of Peter and Jane, here is a typical story:Peter and Jane's mummy is making an apple pie. She does not have any apples.She asks Peter and Jane to buy some at the greengrocer. Peter has the money and Jane has a basket.On the way to the shops, Peter says that they should walk into town and spend the money on sweets.They can take the apples from Mrs Pippin's garden on the way home.It is a long walk to the shops in town.Luckily, a friendly stranger offers them a lift.He lets Peter and Jane sit in the front. They like this.When the stranger sees a police car, he says that Peter and Jane must get out quickly.The shops are not far now.\"Look!\" says Peter. \"Here is the sweet shop.\"Peter has aniseed balls. Jane buys some sherbert lemons. Peter has some money left, so they travel home by bus.On the way home, they see the friendly stranger helping some other children.Before going home, Peter and Jane climb into Mrs Pippin's garden. There are lots of juicy red apples.Peter gives Mrs Pippin's dog an aniseed ball to stop it barking.Jane's mummy has made a surprise tea, but Peter has eaten too many sweets. He has a tummy ache.There is a knock at the door. It is Mrs Pippin.As you can, it's a nice innocent story for young boys and girls who are learning to read. The illustrations are by John Berry, who also illustrated the Ladybird Book of the Recession and a very informative title about scout badges. I hope that these titles will reappear in print at some point in the future."},
{"title": "Derek at 50", "date": "Friday, August 13, 2010", "text": "Derek as 007If you're new to this blog, please click here to find out why the diaries of a local government officer called Derek have become so popular.This week's installment begins in 1981 - the year of Charles and Diana, inner city riots and New Romantics. Apart from a brief entry about the virtues of bringing back capital punishment (presumably for rioters rather than New Romantics), Derek has very little to say about current affairs. However, he isn't completely cut-off from the cultural zeitgeist:'I bought Brenda a record yesterday: the theme music by Vengalis (sic) from the film \"Chariots of Fire\". Marvellous music it is - the sort that fills one with heroic visions and deep thoughts that bring tears. We like it very much.'Like the other volumes of Derek's diary, this one is largely a chronicle of the internecine squabbles within his local Mormon church, with frequent references to admonishments and expulsions. I had no idea that the Mormon church were so pedantic. Given the efforts that they put  into converting people, I'd naively assumed that abstinence from alcohol and a liking for the Osmonds would be enough to guarantee liftetime membership of the Mormons. I was wrong.One of the curious things about Derek's diaries is how normal and mundane they can seem until suddenly, without any warning, he'll casually mention that he is stocking up on tinned food because he is expecting the End Times. This seems to be the prism through which Derek views the world. When some local boys vandalise a playground, it is sign of Satan's growing power:'When it comes to having an evil brood of children, Mr Supter's two adopted children must surely take the prize. They fulfill to the letter the Apostle Paul's prophecy about children in the last days being \"disobedient to parents and without natural affection\".'Derek and Brenda also hold some unconventional views about the age of the Earth - one of the books I inherited from Derek's library asserts that dinosaurs and humans coexisted a few thousand years ago. When Brenda decides to do an environmental studies course, this leads to some lively exchanges with her lecturer:'Brenda attended her class last night. Much of it is based on the theory of evolution, and that really gets up her nose; but she does not let it pass unchallenged. Her lecturers will come to dread her arrival before the course is over. One of them was expounding the theory of tectonic plates, and asserted that the British Isles were not only moving but also sinking. Brenda asked whether it was not the time to drop anchor!'Brenda in the 1950sI was also intrigued by this anecdote from Derek's church:'This evening has not been an easy one. At seven o'clock I met with Jennifer Griffin at the chapel, and introduced her to the science of psycho-cybernetics. Slowly but surely she is beginning to change for the better.'During the last few months I've been gradually building a picture of Derek's life. I now know where he grew up, how he fell in love with Brenda and left the Midlands to enjoy a new life in the West Country, but there was one thing that kept nagging. On the strength of Derek's diary entries, he enjoyed a good relationship with his son and they enjoyed many activities together, but I couldn't help feeling that something was missing. Today I found the answer:'Richard is, despite his handicap, a witty lad who comes out with some priceless remarks on many occasions. Last Saturday morning, he came into our bedroom and had his usual preoccupation with death. As we discussed the matter, I pointed upwards and told him that he was too young to go up there. Quick as a flash he said \"Up on the moon?\" Later in the same discussion he said, \"I want to go up where Jesus are.\" You and me both, son!Sometimes we go a little mad and, hand in hand, leave the house by the back door and walk down the street to the front door and there ring the bell persistently until Brenda or her mother answers. We did this on Satuday morning in our slippers. As we were walking down the pavement, he burst out laughing, and when I queried the matter said \"Look at my feet\". I did, and they were slipperless. I looked back up the street; and there the slippers were sitting in the middle of the pavement like a couple of orphans.Though he demands much patience, one cannot imagine life without him. He is a joy and delight in so many respects. We love him dearly. We have been well-blessed in that his health is not the problem that it was. Even so, his life is a precarious one. We thank the Lord for him from day to day.'When Derek wrote this entry, Richard has just celebrated his 20th birthday.The volume ends with fleeting references to the Falklands Conflict, before finishing with this brief paragraph:'Today Brenda and I celebrate 25 years of married life together, which in these cynical times is a real achievement! This weekend the whole family are coming down to celebrate the event; ironically I shall not be there; I shall be at the Priesthood meeting in Manchester.And what shall I say of those years now past? Have they been a blissful ecstacy? By no means. Each one of them has been a test and a trial. Were it not for the testimony of the Gospel and the sacred covenants made at the altar of the temple, I am sure that our marriage would have failed.  I thank God that despite the difficulties of the past, we do live in peace together and enjoy many things together.'After reading this, I picked up a volume from 1955 and was touched by this passage:'This evening Brenda and I lay in the churchyard and muttered to each other. She has had her hair done and looks wonderful. I am not going back. I am going to set up a home - with an open door - and I am going to marry the girl. I have an eternity in which to live with Brenda.'"},

{"title": "Ordinary People?", "date": "Tuesday, August 10, 2010", "text": "My wife and sons have gone to Essex for two weeks - an eccentric choice, but thankfully inexpensive - so I shall be able to devote more time to exploring the Derek archives.In the meantime, here's a selection of some of the photos that I've come across during the last few days:I found this in an album of Victorian photos from Liverpool. She certainly has a Mona Lisa smile, but I'm not sure about the weird gloves.It's hard to judge the character of people from photographs when slow shutter speeds forced them to adopt a hard stare. Perhaps his face relaxed into a warm smile as soon as the flash went, or maybe he's just a tough bastard. Sherlock Holmes would probably say something along the lines of \"Although he dresses like a gentleman, I see from his countenance and the thin layer of dried mud on the bottom of his shoes, that he is a member of the labouring classes.\"The classic late-Victorian outfit, with the exaggerated thin waist. My wife's great-grandfather grew up in Glasgow at the end of the nineteenth century and told her that he remembered seeing women in the back streets urinating where they stood. At first glance, he would see a respectable-looking lady dressed like the woman above, then he would notice a stream of urine emerging from their feet. Understandably, the women became very agitated and shooed the boy away.I'll leave the Glasgow jokes to someone else.I'm not sure if this is a gay couple, a Victorian \"Little and Large\" stage act, or the first example of a confusing Facebook profile pic.He's an commanding-looking chap. It's strange how impressive moustaches could be in those days. I couldn't help contrasting him with someone who appeared in last Satuday's Guardian Weekend magazine:That's progress for you.It's spooky to think that she's lived a whole life and died of old age, particularly as there's something very contemporary about her face. Perhaps that's because children weren't as good at maintaining a serious, Victorian expression.I can't think of anything pithy or slightly amusing to say about this. It's just three people with some hay. But I like it.This is an odd picture. The print is the same size as the negative and I had to enlarge it. I'm not sure if the woman is pulling something out or putting it in, but she seems quite happy either way.This is from the good old days, when people would dress up to talk to horses.Finally, a press photograph from 25th February, 1961:On the back, a caption reads: Prime Minister addresses Young Conservatives. As you can see, the term \"Young Conservative\" is an oxymoron. They can't wait to be 50 and live in Chalfont St Giles, regularly popping into town to visit their club, perhaps with the odd visit to Madam de Sade's for some corrective therapy (just like Nanny).On the subject of photos, I must post a link to this post of \"boring\" (but curiously compelling) snapshots at Brett's excellent blog Branches and Rain, which also contains this wonderful post about the time he didn't die."},
{"title": "Cutting Edge?", "date": "Saturday, August 07, 2010", "text": "Technology  appears to be developing even more quickly than I'd thought possible.  Only the other day, I saw a poster in the local chemist that read:  \"Transfer your memories to DVD\". Why would I want to do that? It seems  like a high-risk strategy. On the other hand, if I could purge some of  the most embarrassing experiences of my life onto a small plastic disk,  I'd definitely consider it.At work, I've just finished a trial  of what is supposed to the the most advanced, cutting edge, state of the  art (insert extra cliches here) voice recognition software. The  program's selling point is that it adapts to the individual user's  voice, becoming attuned to the subtle nuances of accent and timbre until  eventually, it is word-perfect.The program promised to  revolutionise my department, speeding up data entry to the point where  we could put twice as many books on sale every day, so I was very keen  on the idea. I installed the software and started reading passages from  different novels into a microphone, so that the program could become  accustomed to my dulcet tones.As the software also had a possible  practical application in the warehouse, it was decided that someone  from downstairs would come and join us.I don't know who chose our new  guinea pig.  He speaks in a sort of animal-like grunt and is known as \"Bear\"  by the lads in the warehouse (in fairness, the poor man has two teeth  missing and the left side of his face bears a scar from dental surgery).  It seemed an eccentric choice, but perhaps someone thought that this  would be a true test of the software.The trial began. I started reading out a stream of book details: \"John Le Carre. Tab. The Spy Who came in From the Cold. Tab. Hodder and Stoughton. Tab...\"Unfortunately  the software seemed to suffer from some form of Tourettes. In addition  to failing to understand my BBC accent, it came up with bizarre phrases  like Angry Hookers, Drug Kill and Evil Sex Gang. HarperCollins became Harming Colin, Pearson became Pierced Tongue and Stanley Paul became Sadly Porn. It was very odd.Meanwhile,  on the other side of the room, \"Bear\" was grunting into the microphone  and getting word-perfect transcriptions. What was going on? One person  suggested that the moment I was put in front of a microphone, I started  hamming it up, trying to sound posher than I was. I suppose that's  possible, but surely if my hamming was consistent, the software should  have picked that up?I persisted for a week, as I had been  assured that the program would evolve, gradually getting used to my  voice. The final straw came on a Friday afternoon, when I was trying to  enter the name of a children's publisher:\"Blackie.\"The screen said Black Key.\"Blaackee.\"This time it said Lackey.\"Blackie\" (said in a clipped, Noel Coward voice).The screen read Plucky.At this point I started to get really annoyed.\"BLACKIE! BLACKIE! ****ing BLACKIE!\"In the middle of this rant, the only non-white person in the building walked past and stopped in their tracks.I was mortified.I knew that if I tried to explain it would only make things worse and plunge me into a Father Ted \"I'm not a racist\" scenario, so I calmly, but desperately continued: \"Published by Blackie Books...published by Blackie Books.\"I think I got away with it.After  that incident, I decided to go back to good, old-fashioned two-finger  touch typing. I've no doubt the day will come when we can transfer our  memories onto a hard drive and have flawless conversations with  computers, but it isn't here yet."},
{"title": "The Passion of Derek", "date": "Friday, August 06, 2010", "text": "If you are new to this blog and are unaware of the growing cult of Derek, then click here.This week's installment takes us back to 1986, when Derek appeared to be assailed by a succession of doubts, minor illnesses and financial worries. Several people have commented on the improbable names of Derek's friends and I'd be inclined to agree, but my parents' social circle included a Dudley Futter, Sybil Liquorice and Cynthia Snodgrass (which I'd always assumed was a comedy name), so I remain open minded.We begin with a heart-wrenchingly honest account of married life:'Brenda looked most attractive yesterday. She made a new dress for herself on Saturday, and matched it up with green, heart-shaped earrings, and a green necklace. I suppose the colour was turquoise, but that is a difficult word to spell, so I have called them \"green\". Anyway, among the new choir members she shone like a star.It has been good being at home with just Brenda. We have a natural comfort in each others company. We are like well-worn slippers. If there were only a physical relationship related to this fellowship, I should be the happiest of men. As it is, I weep inside and suffer quietly. A covenant is still a covenant.We had great concern last night. It seems that the marriage of Mike Sheepwash and Hermione has run into major problems. Mike has been sacked from his casual job at Sainsbury's for daring to ask for some time off. I cleaned the bathroom before tea; during my eating, I watched a film on televsion: \"The Battle of Midway\" and became quite angered by the unnecessary blasphemy that it contains. But the battle scenes were good.I am not sure of my life at the moment. It seems prosaic and empty as though I had reached an end of things. Certainly I seem inhibited with the same old problems that have haunted me for years. I am a rotten missionary, do very little compassionate work, and seem hidebound by patterns and habits that I seem not to have the energy to break. The failures and disappointments of this year are heavy upon me. I seem to have nowhere to go in my life except the grave. And yet I have so much! Why must I be so hidebound by a sense of continuing failure? Surely there ought to be some fight left.I browsed in my old journals this afternoon and perceived how boring, how inadequate a record they were. It is all such a mish-mash. Still, perhaps my children will find some comfort and joy in it. But I see now that I could never have made a living from writing.'Some of Derek's entries are unintentionally funny, but these disarmingly honest extracts are terribly poignant. Here is a man in middle age, disappointed with both himself and his life. Derek clearly loves his wife, but feels starved of affection, let alone anything else. In one terribly sad entry, Derek notes the rare pleasure of receiving a hug from Brenda.Derek's children obviously didn't receive much \"comfort and joy\" from the diaries, which is why they were thrown out. It might seem a callous act, but I'm not sure if I would like to discover a cache of diaries written by my father.I should add at this point that perhaps there is an unconscious motive behind my decision to keep Derek's diaries. My father was also called Derek and must have been born around the same time. Like his namesake, he was a faithful husband, deeply religious and, on the surface, seemed the epitome of the safe, suburban, working man. But deep down he too was plagued by insecurities and unfulfilled passions and dreams. His life ended in illness and disappointment, but he derived some solace from a grandson that he never thought he'd see.If all that has left you feeling thoroughly depressed and wishing you'd gone to \"Chimps on Ice\", I'll finish on a lighter note:The office was rather startled on Friday afternoon. Mr Sumpter required me to go out into the country with one of the ladies to get an error corrected. I said that I was not happy to do this if it meant travelling alone with her. Several heads shot up. But the point was made, and now Mr Spry is going with her. One has known too many evil situations arising in the past caused by married persons being thrown together in lonely situations."},

When asked why she was there, she replied:\"It was a nice day out for the kids...better than Legoland. I absolutely loved him. I just think he is a hero and I wanted to pay my respects. He kept them coppers on the run all that time. Fair enough people died but they must have deserved it.If social services have a go at me for it, I'll tell them    where to go.

{"title": "More Random Things Found at Work", "date": "Friday, July 30, 2010", "text": "A few weeks ago I discovered that we were going to start receiving books from Ireland and sure enough, the number of titles about obscure saints has suddenly shot up. This is my favourite:I've heard of the Hand of God, but what is this all about? Is it a more casual form of divine intervention, for less important cases? Either way, it's a wonderful jacket.The addition of Ireland to our supply chain is a real bonus, as the quality of the books is generally high, but it does make it harder to trace the origin of some of the obscure items that are hidden between the pages. For example, is this badly-composed photo from Britain or Ireland?It definitely isn't Sussex, but I'm pretty sure this is:I'm almost certain that it's Hastings. I found it in an album of photos that were so dull, even the owner gave up after seven pages. This picture is one of a pair and shows how important the resort was as a tourist destination, with bustling coach parks and crowds of tourists. In this picture you can see a building with a sign saying \"POLICE. INQUIRIES. LEFT LUGGAGE\", so it was clearly a busy place.Here is another, more exotic form of travel:This is a quintessentially 1950s Dan Dare Britain, still hanging on to its status as an imperial, maritime power; now conquering the stars with an army of grammar school children, probably called Colin and Jean.Perhaps \"Return to the Lost Planet\" was bought with this:This Book Token card was designed by Rowland Hilder and comes with its own detachable bookplate, which has a smaller version of the cover. I know that these sorts of pastoral images can seem a bit naff, but there's something very appealing about this one.Here is a frontispiece from the Edwardian era:In an age when a lot of us are getting our knickers in a twist about the burqa, it's easy to forget that we also used to have some fairly conservative ideas about dress. A century ago, the removal of one's hat could cause both outrage and, sometimes, a sexual frisson. The lady on the left looks as if it's all too much for her.Things were quite different 30 years later, on the eve of the Second World War:Admitedly, this is unusually saucy for its time, but the mere fact that it was published shows how much the social mores had changed.Fast-forward another 30 years and you find covers like this:I can't begin to imagine what it must have been like for someone who grew up in the age of hats and smelling salts to see covers like this. Sodom and Gomorah! I suppose it didn't happen overnight, but I'm sure that my Great Aunt Nancy must have thought that the world was coming to an end.But while some people were losing their inhibitions, others were improving their diction:I wonder what the criteria were. Presumably, in addition to not speaking as if you had a bun in your mouth, anything too \"common\" or regional was out. But were points added or taken away for speaking like Noel Coward? I'd love to know.Finally, something I found two hours ago:It is an 18th century exercise book, with beautifully-written notes and drawings on trigonometry by a gentleman called Francis Bird.Holding a book that is over two centuries old is exciting enough, but there is something really special about something unique like this. This is a book that, several years ago, would have ended up on a landfill site, so I'm really glad to have the opportunity to save it.Now all I have to do is find someone who wants to buy it. I wonder how many 18th century trigonometry fans are out there?"},

{"title": "Middle Class Angst", "date": "Sunday, July 25, 2010", "text": "According to an article in yesterday's Guardian magazine, the good times are over for the middle class. A combination of economic recession and a fundamental change in the way we work, described as an \"ongoing hollowing-out of the middle ranks in the British job market\", will see an increasing number of people struggling to maintain a lifestyle that felt like a birthright.I read this article with a curious detachment. Perhaps this is because I have never felt truly middle class. I have all of the trappings: a BBC accent, hundreds of books, a permanent supply of balsalmic vinegar, tasteful contemporary watercolours on the walls, Laura Ashley sofas (thank you Joyce) and the obligatory wooden floor, but I still fear that knock on the door, when they come to arrest me for impersonating a middle class person.I grew up in a house where there were no novels and slept under nylon sheets that glowed in the dark with static electricity. My mother read The Sun and kept our loo rolls in knitted covers with a plastic ballerina at the top. We were the respectable working class. My parents believed in hard work, owning your own property and saving rather than spending. To them, gambling, smoking and drinking were utterly immoral and threatened to plunge them back into the class that were striving to leave behind.I was the cuckoo in the nest. I spoke with a different accent, listened to Sibelius and liked \"funny food\". In later years, my father asked why I wanted a wooden floor: \"In my day, that meant that you couldn't afford a carpet.\"I clearly wasn't working class, so I must be middle, but when I read the Guardian article I still found it very hard to relate to any of the people mentioned. I certainly had nothing in common with a couple in Richmond, who earned at least £150,000 between them, but I also felt pretty remote from the Ormsby family, who were cited as being at the poorer end of the middle classes.At first we seemed to have some things in common. Like the Ormsby's, we were driven out of London by the property prices and led a pretty frugal existence, expecting a week's holiday in France if we were lucky. But then I read that Kate Ormsby earned £39,000 and her husband, who worked in the same department had a lower-paid salary. Realistically, that put them on at least £60,000 per annum.I have worked out that we are living on around half of that - hovering around a figure that the Joseph Rowntree Foundation calculated was the absolute minimum that a family of four could live on.This \"Minimum Income Standard\" was announced a few weeks ago and in some ways, reading it came as a relief. Rather than feeling guilty for not managing our finances properly, I realised that we had worked minor miracles, surviving on a relatively low income. There have been sacrifices but when I look back to the 1990s, when we enjoyed a double-income and several holidays a year, I still feel richer.I can think of several couples who work absurd hours, paying exhorbitant childcare fees just so that they can live the dream. They have the house in leafy SW London, the obligatory three or four holidays a year (including a trip to Lapland at Christmas) and the perfectly-designed garden. The fact that they barely see their daughters doesn't seem to come into the equation. The children have everything they want (apart from parental contact), go to an expensive class on Saturday morning and have a whole wardrobe of party dresses. What more could anyone want?This recession will be a challenge for many, but I hope that people will use the current demise of the consumer society as an opportunity to realise that the \"lifestyle\" myth of the last 20 years hasn't made anyone happier. Indeed, many of us have become oppressed by debts and clutter.I'm not romanticising about being skint. I'm not sure if poverty is good for the soul (I'm sure that the Poet Laura-eate wouldn't think so), but when I see people who earn four or five times as much as me looking so miserable, I can't help feeling vindicated. The best things in life are free, whatever the adverts say."},

Some girls in bikinis on Brighton or Bournemouth beach:Apparently yesterday was hotter than somewhere a lot further south that's normally much hotter than here. Or something like that. Anyway, it's a good excuse for newspapers to have a large photo of girls in bikinis.3.

My spindly, malnourished generation were happy if we got a C and scraped through to East Anglia or Kent. And when we got there we never said we went to university, because that would have been lording it above the people in polytechnics and colleges. Now, everyone's much cleverer and they all go to uni.5. A photo of students in gowns accompanying an alarmist article about the lack of university places:Apparently the Government didn't know that we were all becoming more intelligent and failed to expand the higher education system to accommodate the extra A grade students. The Daily Mail, which one week earlier implied that these exam results weren't worth the paper they're printed on, will now happily take the Government to task for failing our young.6. Some British holidaymakers stranded somewhere abroad:It used to be French air traffic control, but now we have terrorism, volcanic dust and bankrupt tour operators to contend with. Wouldn't it be easier to stay at home?These tired clichés are wheeled out every year, accompanied by articles that probably come from a template somewhere. Unless something interesting happens, I shall be avoiding the news until September."},

It was more than I was willing to endure. With some force I told her to stop haunting me, that she was making a laughing stock of herself and that I was a married man who was twice her age and more and not prepared in any way to compromise his marriage even by a shadow of a relationship with another woman. She turned pale and said that it was my friendship she wanted. We then got on the bus and I invited her to sit next to me. She started to make banal conversation. I told her that such conversation was an anathema to me. I then got out my book and started reading. She fidgeted.\"\"I made a terrible joke in one of the marriages I performed today. The surname of one bride was 'Winter'. At the end of the ceremony I shook her by the hand and said 'Fear not, Winter is past.' There was silence; and then a great roar of laughter from the guests.\"\"The town has been invaded by thousands of scooter bikers, many of them as shorn and decorated as Lamanites. There have been a few dozen arrests already. As I went to catch the bus this morning, one was wandering about wrapped in a purple blanket, his blond (sic) moll in tow. They were seeking breakfast without too much success at that hour of the morning. While I was standing in the bus station they dragged themselves by. After a while they returned. The lad was shouting at his moll 'How stupid! Fancy thinking we'd find them in a f*****g coach station!' He was not a man I would introduce to my daughters.\"\"A new temporary lady started with us today. She drove me home in her little mini and bombarded me with questions about the Church the whole way.A most articulate blackman came into my office this afternoon to complain about Mr Limpet, who treated him in a most brutal and insulting manner for merely passing through the wrong door.  The man was most upset. I put him on the internal line to Mr Woodcock, who is seeking enough evidence to damn Limpet once and for all.Unfortunately a Labour Council is in power at the moment and they will defend their own kind, however villainous they be, to the death. That is their sadness.\"\"Well, my imprecation at the Creative Writing Group was a great success this morning. As one gets used to the other members of the class, one tends to notice a polarisation of views on various aspects of literature that show the period of others of greater age as opposed to the younger members. And there is a strong streak of feminism in Kathy Jones, probably due to her unhappy marriage. The subject of bad language came up and there was a tendency to say the use merely reflected the reality of life. Pam Bolloch said that she would rather not hear such realities; and that was an end of the subject.\"\"Last Saturday when I was in the garden, Richard decided that we ought to make a gift of some of our rhubarb to Mrs Reames. He pulled out a stick and proferred it to her. All though (sic) it had not been my intent to bless her, I did not want to seem mean so I gave her a dozen sticks. I then took the opportunity of discussing her youngest son with her. He has been coming out of her flat then leaping over our side wall to get out to the road via our gateway. I suggested to his mother in the kindest way that it was possible that my foot might come in violent collision with his crutch if he did not desist. He seems to be desisting.\"\"We wasted our home evening last night by watching part of the Sound of Music. Despite our many watchings the magic of this film remains, in spite of the fact that Sue draws our attention to details that are best left unnoticed, such as Julie Andrews wet armpits in one dress. And there is a lovely scene where Christopher Plummer calls Julie Andrews 'captain' instead of 'Fraulein', a line fluff that the filmmakers have kept in, and a wise decision it was.\""},

For a few terrifying minutes, I thought that was it.My memory of the experience is hazy, but I do remember thinking that a mistake had been made somewhere. I was relatively young and healthy, ate my five a day and could fit into a pair of 34\" waist trousers. I drank a bit too much wine, but didn't that thin the blood?I also vaguely recall a slight disappointment about the banality of what might have been my final thoughts.However, I slowly began to improve and the ECG tests showed that I had a healthy heart. Five hours later I was watching Placido Domingo in Simon Boccanegra. So what did happen?

It had rave reviews (the exhibition, not my blog post, sadly) in the press. The general feeling was that at long last, Nash was receiving the recogition he deserved as one of the most significant British artists of the inter-war years.Two days ago, I found this letter tucked away in a first edition of a novel called \"Stanton\" by Desmond Coke:Stupidly, I hadn't noticed it when I was sorting through the books that had just arrived. It was only later, when someone said that they'd found a letter by someone called Paul Nash, that I realised what we had found.In the letter, Nash praises Desmond Coke for his novel about life at a public school, but gently chides him for being too coy about the homosexual relationships that were common in that environment. Whether Coke read Nash's comments is uncertain. The letter is dated April 7th 1931; Desmond Coke's obituary appeared in The Times on April 28th.I have contacted an auction house and at some point the letter will be up for sale. In the meantime, I'm enjoying being the temporary custodian of a piece of history."},
{"title": "Madness Visible", "date": "Tuesday, July 06, 2010", "text": "I have ranted on several occasions about vanity publishing, but perhaps I was wrong. Without self-publishing, the world would be denied an opportunity to read this book, which I found yesterday:I've read the blurb several times and I'm still not sure what it's about, but perhaps I should let the author explain:The idea for writing \"Heritage and Nelson\" was conceived by the realization that so much of our heritage is fast disappearing and once lost can never be regained.  I can think of no better example of heritage than Nelson and his Captains combined with the strength of English oak.  I have gone back to the times when rocks, mountains, seas, plants and creatures were born, for all these things have a bearing on our lives today.   \"Why?\" you may ask \"Go back to the mists of the beginning?\" - because everything in nature is born.Does that clear it up for you?The book seems to be in three parts, beginning with a brief overview of the geological history of the earth, up to the birth of Lord Nelson. This neatly leads into the middle part of the book - a celebration of the life of Lord Nelson. However, the book's true purpose remains a mystery until we reach the third and final section, when it is revealed that \"Heritage and Nelson\" is actually all about the author, Les Winter:Here are a few photos, with Les Winters' original captions:\"Les Winter in a very thoughtful mood while actually working on this book\" \"The wall above the fireplace in the Nelson bar\"\"Actor Producer John Neville and Les Winter share a joke on the bowling green\" \"The author finds time to relax for a few moments with friends in the bar of \"The Lord Nelson\"Enter \"Mine Host\"As you can see, the book is a complete Winterfest.\"Heritage and Nelson\" seems to imply that Les Winter is part of some apostolic succession of great Englishmen and, for all I know, perhaps he is, or was. The dustjacket blurb gives a brief biographical sketch of the author's life, mentioning that he is \"dead keen\" on natural beers, local archaeology, folk lore and nature, but manages to tell us very little about the man himself.I suspect that he was a \"character\".Self-published books are usually a poor imitation of professionally produced ones, but occasionally I come across ones like \"Heritage and Nelson\", which have a mad genius about them. They are the outsider art of the book world, possessing a unique vision that defies the conventionally accepted criteria of what constitutes a good book.With the best will in the world, Les Winter has written an utterly absurd book, which probably should never have been published, but in another life it could have been a rip-roaring blog. It's a great pity for Les that he was born in 1920."},
{"title": "Something New", "date": "Sunday, July 04, 2010", "text": "Many thanks to Richard at Grey Area for mentioning the show of work by the art students at Hastings Art College. I went yesterday and it was one of the best things I've seen for a long time.It was really refreshing to see the work of people who hadn't become part of the system and while some pieces were quite derivative of artists like Grayson Perry, Tracy Emin and the Chapman brothers (who are Hastings alumni), there were others that had a very strong voice of their own.But derivative or not, nothing I saw was boring.I almost didn't go. My wife was given a new book to proof-read and needed a clear weekend to meet the deadline. I was on child duty. Was it really worth going if I had to drag two very reluctant boys with me?In the end, my oldest son wasn't well enough to go and quarantined himself in cyberspace. I decided to take a chance with my younger son, hoping that he'd be have a slightly less jaded attitude towards anything that smacked of culture. To my surprise and delight, he loved the show. He was captivated by the sculptures and installations, laughed at the deliberately absurd pieces and described some works as \"beautiful\".At four years old, my son had no idea what \"art\" was and treated the exhibition as a thing of entertainment and wonder. Having him with me actually enhanced the experience.Here's a selection of the range of exhibits on display:For some reason, this was my son's favourite, although he was also very taken with the exhibits in this room:Later, during some fish and chips on the seafront, my son went into a reverie. I asked him what he was thinking and he replied \"I'm imagining what fun I would have if I was at the place where they make things.\"I've always liked the more traditional equestrian clothing, but I think I could get used to these.These are five separate frames, with a depth of more than ten feet between the first and the last. As you can see, viewed from the front they form a whole.This is one of a series of cheeky illustrations that use quotations from Shakespeare.I really liked the way the work was exhibited and loved the building, which has beautiful sea views like this:The college will shortly be moving to a new purpose built building, so this was my first and last visit to the Archery Road campus.Finally, I came to the display of work by Richard's Graphic Communications students:I loved this and really want to get hold of one - I'm going to make enquiries. Being a true hypocrite, I went shopping at Tesco this afternoon. I feel dirty now, and not in a good way either.Eat your heart out, John Hinde. These postcards are better than anything you'll see on sale at the gift shops and tourist information centres.I was very impressed with these jacket designs for four dystopian classics. I trust that they would get the thumbs-up from James, at Caustic Cover Critic.Without the cultural baggage and self-importance of the \"art world\", this exhibition was fresh, funny and fearless. It did everything that art should do, but so often fails to once it has become labeled and commodified. That doesn't mean that everything in it was brilliant, but even in the less impressive works - the sub-Tracy Emin canvases or the imitation Grayson Perrys - there was still an authentic voice.It's a great pity that this exhibition lasts for only a few days before disappearing into the ether. What will happen to these students? How many of them will be able to make a living from their talents, particularly in our new austere financial climate? With funding for the arts under a greater threat than ever, the outlook seems bleak.But art always seems to thrive during difficult times, when people need it more than ever. So perhaps, after the rather depressing era of Brit Art and silly money, we are about to enter a golden age."},
{"title": "Justified and Ancient", "date": "Friday, July 02, 2010", "text": "There are days when I wonder why I'm spending such a large chunk of my short life in a job that pays so little. But apart from the obvious reasons, there are books like these that make it all worthwhile:Somebody found it this morning, while they were unloading a delivery of dusty crates in the warehouse. It doesn't look much on the outside and at first glance, the inside isn't particularly promising:It's an old Bible. We get hundreds of them every month and they're rarely worth any money, even if they're two hundred years old. But as soon as I started reading the text, I knew that there was something special about this book. Then I found this:I have never held a book that's 420 years old before. Everyone in the office had a David Attenborough moment, talking in hushed voices, as if a normal volume would cause the pages to turn to dust.It even has music (or should that be sweete musick?):And in another section, published the following year, there's one of several beautiful woodcuts:I might work too many hours and the money is dreadful, but I would be loath to turn my back on a job that provides moments like these."},
{"title": "Littlehampton", "date": "Saturday, June 26, 2010", "text": "Today, walking through the streets of Littlehampton, I saw an image that was crying out to be photographed. On the pebble-dashed wall of a drab, 1950s house, an England flag limply hung next to a rusting satellite dish. It neatly encapsulated the spirit of the new Britain (not to mention England's performance in the World Cup).But just as I started to get my camera out, a battered Transit van containing four bare-chested skinheads pulled up. It was their house. I slowly put the camera back in my pocket and started walking. I'd lost the photo, but saved a fortune in dental work.I had decided to go to Littlehampton in a moment of desperation, after my wife made it clear that she wanted us all out of the house. I had a hazy, eight-year-old's memory of sandy beaches and amusement arcades and thought that Littlehampton would offer the right combination of shallow, sensory experiences for my sons. How wrong I was.It was probably just as well that I had mistakenly parked my car over a mile from the beach, as this enabled me to enjoy the pleasures of the town centre. If you're ever in Littlehampton, you simply must visit the \"Dinky Doo Diner\":If I ever get to the stage where I travel by electric wheelchair to an eatery that is named after male genitalia, please have me humanely destroyed.One thing that Littlehampton certainly couldn't be accused of is being a clone town. There are lots of small, locally-owned shops, but this is because most of the big retail chains wouldn't be seen dead in Littlehampton. A combination of low rents and mild psychosis has resulted in a large number of shops selling goods of varying degrees of pointlessness. I wouldn't be at all surprised if there is a shop solely dedicated to hair nets or computer diskettes.As we approached the seafront, we passed an army recruitment fair which I would imagine was very successful. What fear would a tour of duty in Afghanistan hold when you have already experienced Littlehampton?A roadsign helpfully pointed the way to \"The Sea\", but when we got there it wasn't there. Where had it gone? The amusement arcade was still there, but wasn't what it used to be. Where were the laughing sailors and the elegant Chinese woman who carefully wrote a card telling your fortune?I also felt that the clientelle had gone downhill:I bought an ice cream from a lady who must have been at least 80. She had a refinement that seemed out of place with her flabby, tattooed, shaven-headed customers and I wondered if she ever hankered after the days when men wore hats and people minded their Ps and Qs.\"The people here are weird. Can we go home?\", my eldest son pleaded. We started walking and after passing the shell of a new branch of Lidl, saw the home of Littlehampton's sole, middle-class inhabitant:Littlehampton is not an affluent area, but even when people do have money there is a poverty of ambition. The owner of this car has been able to afford a personalised numberplate, but how do they choose to express their individuality?I don't think any circumferences are involved in this numberplate, but I'm intrigued by the fact that someone has taken the time and expense to secure this registration. In the Republic of Steerforth (actually not a republic, because I'd rather have a monarchy than Tony Blair or Margaret Thatcher as head of state), people with personalised numberplates would be subject to punitive legislation.If you are in America, going to the \"Hamptons\" may have some kudos, but in Sussex it is something to be avoided."},

{"title": "The Further Adventures of Derek", "date": "Tuesday, June 22, 2010", "text": "As some readers of this blog will know, four months ago I came across a large box of journals written by a man called Derek. They were about to be thrown into a skip, as they had no resale value. But when I started to look through the foolscap files of typed A4 pages, I realised that I had found something special.At first I laughed at Derek's diaries for their Pooterish prose; but as I got to know him, I felt a growing respect for this seemingly ordinary man who was plagued by extraordinary thoughts and desires.In addition to his devout Mormon faith and passion for books, Derek's  diaries reveal a man of eclectic tastes, from this:To this programme from 1975:I can imagine Derek enjoying an evening of jolly fol-de-rols with the King's Singers, but his passion for wrestling took me completely by surprise.The saddest thing about Derek's diaries was his constant use of the word posterity. Derek clearly believed that his carefully-typed pages would be cherished by his descendants, but instead they were disposed of as part of a job lot with his book collection.I have just finished reading Derek's diaries from 1988. Here is a typical extract:The day is cold and gloomy, though dry. I spent the morning repairing one of my temple garments; I also hit the street to renew a book at the library and also buy some oats and peas for the rabbits. While I was in the shop, a man in motor cycle gear asked me if the oats were for rabbits. He spoke curiously. Anyway, he then ordered two pounds of mixed molasses. I asked him if they were for a lion. The girl serving us broke into laughter; he did not.I repeated my fatuous remark. He then said \"I do not understand what you say. I am deaf.\" No answer to that!Bikers were obviously a problem for Derek. On another occasion he wrote:Over the weekend the town has been full of \"bikers\", scooterists from all parts of the country, who foregather in the open spaces and spend their time drinking endless cans of lager.This would have been a perfectly innocuous sentence, but the addition of two words - scooterists and foregather - inject a Pooterish element into Derek's prose.Derek desperately wanted to be a writer and as he approached retirement, joined a creative writing class:Well, I read out my piece of work on the history of the View through a Window in class today, and Mrs Jones suggested that I either offer it to the local newspaper or send it to Pilkington's house magazine. But read out to Brenda at dinnertime, it did not seem to have the same quality; I thought it a trite piece of work, Try as I may, I seem unable to get into my writing that density, that texture that is the quality of true writing. My piece seemed only like a clever piece of sixth form tomfoolery.I felt rather like Charles Ritchie who wrote in his journal: \"...always this piece of staring white paper in front of me with the few and feeble words strung across it. Nothing could be more stubborn than my devotion, nothing more stupid than my persistence. After all, I have written nothing - I will write nothing. Twenty years have not been enough to convince me of my lack of talent.\"And yet I have prayed about this matter, asking my Father for time and opportunity to write if my talent is real. I believe he has answered that prayer. I cannot believe that he has blessed my efforts to retire in order to cast me on a barren shore. There are riches here if only I will persevere. But it will involve me in taking life far more seriously than hitherto.But I would argue that Derek's weakness as a writer - his constant use of Biblical words and phrases like foregather and persevere- is that very thing that makes his diaries so appealing. Derek has a voice that is very much his own and thanks to the internet, some of his writing can now have more readers than he would have dreamed possible."},

I can't stress what a huge relief it is to no longer be the sole breadwinner. Admittedly, it is only a temporary proofreading job, but there is a strong possibility that more work will follow. We could certainly do with the money.The one downside of this is that I've had very limited access to the internet, as my wife has been using our (or as I prefer to call it, my) laptop almost non-stop for the last ten days. Blogging has been virtually impossible under these conditions, so I've been at a bit of a loose end.If only I liked the World Cup.I suppose if I was French, I'd have a mistress somewhere, but being British, the most I can hope for is probably a model railway in the attic. And anyway, how do people find the time to have illicit affairs? It's as much as I can do to get my shirts ready for the next day.I've tried writing a blog entry at work, but it's not the most relaxed of environments. For a start, my employers tend to frown on drinking wine during office hours and second, people keep interrupting my train of thought with inane questions. The open-plan office is a terrible invention.I even tried writing a blog post yesterday in longhand, during a train journey to London, but I was soon joined by a family of four who spent the entire trip eating malodorous food (those awful \"wraps\" - what are they all about?) and shouting at each other. To make things worse, the mother kept looking at what I was writing and whilst I'm fairly confident that my script is illegible, it was inhibiting.Perhaps I should have tested the illegibility by writing something a little bit saucy about her.As a result, I haven't been able to write about how much I enjoyed fellow blogger Ollie's poetry evening at the Lewes Arms on Thursday, particularly as it featured an eleventh hour appearance from the Incredible Dancing Man of Lewes. I was already in a state of rapture from watching the utterly beautiful Italian poet, Emilia Telese in her stunning Neapolitan fisherman-themed dress (you had to be there), so the IDM was the icing on the cake:I suppose I could have written my blog entry on the blissfully quiet train home from London, but after five hours in a pub with some friends from university, I wasn't quite in the writing mood.It was a good evening. We ended up at the India Club, where we decided to test the theory that no matter what you ordered, the bill always would always come to £10 per head including the tip. As with our last visit, the restuarant was like the Marie Celeste and we decided to leave and come back later. Just as we were going, a waiter popped up from behind a table like a jack in the box. He had been sleeping.When I arrived home, I was pleased to see that a friend had come to stay for the night. She was in a rather serious mood and related a very sad anecdote about a friend of hers which ended with the words \"and then she hung herself.\"There was a long pause, then my wife looked up and said \"You mean, she hanged herself.\" I suppose a week of intense proofreading had taken its toll.I was equally tactless when our friend related another very harrowing tale of a friend who had suffered from a particularly aggressive form of cancer:\"The poor man's had part of his colon removed.\"\"How much?\" I enquired\"Well, about half of it.\" she replied, looking slightly bemused.\"So now he has a semi-colon.\"Luckily she laughed."},

But today I found this memoir, which grabbed me from the first page:\"One night this year, on the walk home from the Underground in the falling snow, I had to lean against the wall of the crematorium where my father went up in smoke. I had had a few drinks. The wind pierced the short, old-fashioned black coat that had belonged to my grandfather. When I walked on a little unsteadily in the dark on the creaking snow, a girl passed on the other side of the road, her high black boots gleaming faintly. She looked across at me, and then went on in the bitter cold.Our three children had measles; Jill was tired. The wind moaned beneath the doors ; we were keeping fires going day and night, and the insects cried in the blazing logs. Our house is small, virtually a cottage, among terraced houses built, originally, for artisans; the road is the appendix of the suburb, with wealthier houses not far off. I like our house: scarcely a piece of furniture, not a picture, carpet or curtain did we choose ourselves; all was given or passed on by relatives; all, or almost all, is incongruous, tasteless, but well used.At times I feel the small house is the centre of the world. It seems a turning-point for aircraft coming in to land at London Airport. Their engines change pitch as they come in from east and west, booming and whining through the dusk, their navigation lights winking hope. When I lie in bed I distrust all aircraft: where are they going? People should stay at home. I prefer the sound of trains far off at night, the clink of a shunting in a cold siding.\"The dustjacket blurb tells us little about John Gale, other than that this is the memoir of an Englishman who was born into a privileged background and enjoyed a rich and fascinating life until the day he went mad. Then everything changed.Gale's autobiography was first published in 1965 and it must have been critically acclaimed, as the Hogarth Press thought it was worth reprinting in 1988, but there is a frustrating lack of information about John Gale on the internet.I shall just have to read the book."},

I refer to those reletionships between members of the same sex that are included in the term homosexuality.\"Like some of the Victorian self-help guides that I've mentioned on this blog, \"On Becoming a Man\" is a curious mixture of sound common sense and the sort of utter nonsense that must have made some of its readers feel completely awful.On the plus side, it does have some great illustrations:\"Any youth is wise who controls his special friendship\"(No they're not. I deeply regret behaving so properly in my youth)\"Teen-age boys think very differently from teen-age girls\"\"The remarkable growth of a teen-age boy is often a source of astonishment to his friends and his family\"(I've always wondered what The Proclaimers' home was like)\"A worthy counsellor will not be arbitary in his judgements\"(But beware of the man in the basebell cap who always has his curtains drawn)\"For each teen-ager, each new venture brings with it a new thrill and a new opportunity\"(Whatever happened to angst and alienation?)\"The habit of saving should be established early in life.\"(So that you can blow it in your early 20s on loose women and poker games)\"Reading is without doubt one of the best means of personal development.\" (In this young man's case, he's learning how to build a small explosive device)This photo is from a 1968 reprint:\"Jack and Joanne had been special friends for about a year. Because of of common interests, it was natural for them to begin going steady.\" (Hopefully a common interest in saucy photos)If a \"teen-age\" boy can heed Dr Shryock's advice, then this is the golden future that awaits him:After all these years, I can finally see the appeal of Jack Kerouac."},

I've spending the last couple of weeks racking my brains trying to find a worthy response, but have failed miserably.I managed to come up with a few random \"things-you-don't-know-about-me\", including my brief and unlikely appearance as a science expert on Radio Five, the time I nearly killed Kenickie in Tunbridge Wells and the vicar who asked me if I minded whether he masturbated, but most of these anecdotes diminished in the telling.I also began a shortlist of blogs to recommend, but the list grew unmanageably long.In the end, I decided to change the rules and instead of personal trivia, I've listed four things that I feel passionately about. There are many other things I could have mentioned, but in the blogosphere, less is more.As far as recommending other blogs goes, I'd rather take the opportunity to say why Katyboo and Motherhood are such compelling bloggers. Although their blogs are very different, they both write with a refreshing candour about the agonies and ecstacies of trying to reconcile their hopes and dreams with the demands of parenthood.With Katyboo, there is a gripping, confessional, warts and all account of her daily life that is far removed from the twee, sentimental nonsense that appears in many magazines. Motherhood has written one of my favourite blog posts of all time, encapsulating the challenges of reconciling desire and duty.And now on to my random selecting of four things that make life worth living. Most people reading this blog will, I'm sure, be aware of the magic of \"A Matter of Life and Death\" (US title \"Stairway to Heaven\"), but just in case there's anyone left who hasn't seen this remarkable film, here's a clip:This is an extraordinary film. On the one hand it is quintessentially English, but on the other it is thoroughly atypical, written by a Hungarian, with an international cast. A Matter of Life and Death is witty, imaginative and humane and must have been a breath of fresh air when it appeared, a year after the end of World War Two.Next, Ravel's Piano Concerto in G Major - a wonderful, life-affirming piece of music that fizzes with energy. Born in 1874, Ravel became associated with the Impressionists and his early works are rich, luxuriant compositions that encapsulate the spirit of the fin de siecle culture before 1914Ravel served as an ambulanceman in the First World War and if he'd been killed in action, posterity would have regarded him as a gifted disciple of Debussy. However, Ravel survived and in the 1920s, discovered jazz.A French composer in his 50s might have been shocked by the vulgarity of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, but Ravel loved it and when he was asked to compose a piano concerto, he wrote a vibrant, jazzy work that exhuded youth and passion. This is the first movement and this unusual performance features Leonard Bernstein performing and conducting:I love the energy and complexity of the music - it really does send shivers down my spine. The first pianist to perform this work remarked to Ravel how hard the music was was to learn. He replied \"You should try writing it!\"What's particularly wonderful about this piano concerto is the contrast between the fast, jazzy outer movements and the heart-breaking beauty of the middle one.Next, The Swimmer:Based on a John Cheever short story, this film is remarkable in so many ways, from Burt Lancaster's performance as the New England WASP who decides to swim home via his neighbours' swimming pools, to Marvyn Hamlisch's haunting score. Released in 1968, The Swimmer captures the spirit of the age, but its themes are timeless and the film's denouement is one of the saddest things I have ever seen.Finally, Vaughan Williams' Symphony No.5 - a work that was first performed during the 1943 Proms season in London. Before the concert began, the audience were told that in the event of an air raid, they were welcome to leave the building but the orchestra intended to carry on playing.The 70-year-old composer walked up to the podium, looking like a slightly dishevelled gentleman farmer, and began conducting.Vaughan Williams' previous symphony, written in the mid-1930s, had been a violent, angst-ridden work, but the new work had a serenity that, for some, seemed to offer spiritual consolation in the midst of war. For others, with its predominantly pastoral nature, this was the swan song of a composer whose musical language had been heavily influenced by English folk music.In fact, this symphony was the work of a man who had fallen in love with a woman nearly 40 years his junior and this movement, in particular, is a passionate, heartfelt outpouring:In the 1950s, they married and for the remainder of his life, Vaughan Williams was blissfully happy. As for the 5th Symphony, it was no swan song. Vaughan Williams went on to write another four, composing his last when he was 85.So there are four reasons for living. I apologise to Motherhood and Katyboo for slightly bending the rules of blog awards, but it was either this or nothing."},

If you have the good fortune to live outside the UK and not know anything about \"The Last of the Summer Wine\", it's about a trio of retired Yorkshiremen who, no longer constrained by the need to make a living, discover their inner child and become increasingly eccentric.The series is much loved by the sort of people who like the poem \"When I am an Old Woman I shall Wear Purple\" and  whilst there is something to be said for raging against the dying of the light, the cloying sentimentality of \"The Last of the Summer Wine\" is one of the most convincing arguments I've come across for euthanasia.Apparently the last episode will be accompanied by special, Yorkshire-based editions of Countryfile and Songs of Praise.The controller of BBC One, Jay Hunt, said \"I am delighted some of the channel's other heritage brands will be  helping to say goodbye in style.\" Heritage brands? Where do people find phrases like this?"},
{"title": "Friday in Rye", "date": "Monday, May 31, 2010", "text": "The train line from Brighton to Ashford may not be one of the great  railway journeys of the world, but it is quietly impressive, passing  thorough the South Downs before hugging the coastline between Eastbourne  and Hastings. Given the final station, it is definitely better to  travel than arrive.Last Friday I boarded a train to Rye, where I'd arranged to meet an old  schoolfriend. I was looking forward to the journey and congratualted  myself when I found an empty table seat by the window, but then I was  joined by this man:I'd  seen him minutes earlier, sprawled horizontally across a bench. He was  in his 60s, with a distinctive leather trilby and a shirt that was  unbuttoned down to the navel. If I'd had any sense, I wouldn't have  picked the one seat in the carriage where he could assume a similar  position.At first he seemed harmless enough, nodding off within seconds of  leaving Lewes. A few people glanced nervously in our direction and I  felt slightly superior for not being fazed by my companion. What was  their problem? He was just a harmless old drunk, looking for a nice  comfy seat.We arrived at Eastbourne and a speaker announced: \"BING BONG. THIS IS  EASTBOURNE. WE ARE NOW AT EASTBOURNE. PLEASE CHANGE HERE FOR...\" At  which point my companion suddenly bolted upright, as if he'd received an  electric shock:\"Eastbourne? I want Ashford. There are  THOUSANDS in Ashford. Thousands. I don't 'ave to worry. Ah'll be  alright. Ah've got money and there's more in Ashford.\" I couldn't  tell who he was talking to, but years of listening to ruddy-faced men  who stank of rum had taught to avoid eye contact at all costs.\"D'you smoke?\" It was a direct  question. I couldn't just ignore him. I remember a man in London asking  me the same question years ago and when I explained that I'd just given  up, he shouted \"I asked for a  cigarette, not your fucking life story!\"I said no. He stared for a few seconds and announced \"I smoke green weed. Green weed.\" I  barely acknowledged him and returned to my newspaper, hoping that my  companion would go back to sleep, but he had other ideas.On the  opposite seats were a teenage girl and boy. The girl had one of the  most absurdly posh faces that I've ever seen, with a long nose and  small, pouty lips, like a young Penelope Keith. It was a face that said \"Cripes, I hear old Squeaky Dawson's been  drummed out of the lacrosse team!\" It was not the sort of face  that would endear itself to my companion. He stared at her.\"I don't like you. I don't like you at  all.\" Now he was becoming a nuisance.\"I don't mind...errr...hmmm...errr...yeah,  but paedophiles...PAEDOPHILES! I'd shoot 'em. BANG! With a shotgun. Fuck  'em. Whoops. Sorry. can't say that.\"At this point he spat on the seat, narrowly missing me. His  eyes closed for a few seconds, then he suddenly leant forward and  looked accusingly at me.\"Paaeedddophiles...\"  He gurgled like Gollum and started to retch. I didn't have a change of  clothes, so changing seats was probably the best course of action, but  the stubborn part of me refused to move and like an idiot, I subjected  myself to a further 20 minutes of madnessHalf an hour later, I was in the beer garden of The George in Rye, drinking a pint of  Harvey's, getting slowly sunburned. I have know my friend since I was  12 and in some ways we have led parallel lives, growing up as cuckoos in  the nests of working class families. Our parents didn't understand how  they'd given birth to sons who liked classical music and had an absurd  interest in European royalty, but to their credit they encouraged us.In my friend's case, when he started drawing pictures of violins at the  age of five, his parents responded by arranging for him to have music  lessons. They weren't pushy, upwardly-mobile parents. Indeed, their idea  of a good night out was playing darts at the British Legion, but  perhaps they'd had thwarted ambitions in their youth and didn't want to  repeat history. My friend ended up being taught by someone who'd trained  with Joachim, who was a friend of Brahms.His parents did everything they could to encourage their son's talent. On a caravan holiday in Hayling Island, the whole family dutifully sat through a live broadcast of Schoenberg's Survivor from Warsaw, oblivious to the fact that it had nothing to do with the violin repertoire.My friend began a music degree, but he found his fellow music students  too insular. When he met some students from the Yehudi Menuin School who  didn't know who the leader of the Labour Party was, he quit and started  a BSc in Sociology. When he graduated, my friend stumbled into business  publishing and within seven years, he was earning a basic salary of  £40,000.At this point my friend went through a crisis. He'd blagged his way into  a job that he had no interest or expertise in and to his surprise, he  kept getting promoted. With each promotion, he felt increasingly unreal  and was depressed by the ease with which he could pretend to be  something he wasn't.One day, my friend handed in his notice. Next, he sold his flat in  Twickenham for £120,000, paid off his mortgage and bought another flat  in Kent for £60,000. Since then, he has earned a living by playing the  fiddle in bands at folk festivals. He is happy.For those of us who don't have Grade 8 violin and 50% equity on our  property, life can be rather more challenging, but the principal remains  the same. Do we risk pursuing happiness at the possible expense of  hard-won achievements, or should we be grateful for what we have?"},
{"title": "What We've Lost", "date": "Friday, May 28, 2010", "text": "The Sussex accent is virtually dead. It has been replaced by a fairly nondescript \"Estuary\" accent that can be heard anywhere within a 60-mile radius of London.Occasionally I hear a rural burr from some of the older people in town, but it's nothing like this wonderful recording from 1959. Click on the John Nash picture below to visit a page featuring Harry Burgess of Firle:The British Library's National Sound archive is a wonderful resource, with recordings that include Tennyson, Florence Nightingale and Arthur Conan Doyle. But my favourite part of the archive is a collection of recordings of accents and dialects, arranged by county.Another favourite of mine is this one from the Isle of Wight. Mrs Sheath has a wonderfully rich voice and if you listen carefully, you can hear a clock gently ticking in the background. As for this accent, it might as well be in another language.Television, cars and people like me have all helped to erode local identities and sadly, we will never hear a voice like Harry Burgess's again. Thank God someone had the foresight to record these accents just before they disappeared."},

These illustrations may not have the visionary genius of Nash Major, but they are an important relic of a movement that included the wonderful Eric Ravilious and Edward Bawden.These artists reclaimed the English countryside from the platitudes of lesser artists and their vision of the pastoral is a more challenging one, imbued with a mysticism that harkens back to William Blake.On the subject of platitudes, that's enough amateur art criticism from me.

{"title": "Solitude", "date": "Tuesday, May 25, 2010", "text": "On Sunday, in the early hours of the morning, Britain came loose from its moorings and started drifting towards the Mediterranean. I know this is true, because the sea became azure, with barely a wave in sight. Normally, it is a greeny-grey colour, with veins of corporate sewerage and disturbed mudflats, but yesterday I was forced to say the word azure for the first time. Nothing else would do.My car said that the temperature was 32 degrees, but it is foreign built and seems to have its own microclimate based on continental weather patterns, so that in winter the reading plunges down to minus ten and beyond. I'm sure that it wasn't hotter than 23.We decided to drive to Birling Gap, a typically pebbly Sussex beach that redeems itself with sand and rockpools at low tide. It was reasonably crowded, but I wasn't bothered. Once, a beach was synonymous with quietude and my idea of bliss was to lie down and listen to the waves, but in the post-children world, my ambitions are broken. If nobody drowns or gets lost, then it's a good day out.The other people on the beach seemed to be mostly families but there were also quite a few young Eastern Europeans, possibly landlocked, in search of an end to things.I looked at the other parents. There were many men with tattoos, beer bellies and small breasts, whose feral appearance belied their tenderness with their children. There were also middle-class couples who all wore sunhats and sensible clothes, dishing out fresh fruit for lunch (\"Who wants some melon?\" \"Me, me, me!\"). Where did I fit into it all?When I was planning the trip, I envisaged a montage of happy memories with me in the starring role as the fun dad. But I was rubbish. I complained when my oldest son kicked sand all over me, felt profoundly bored when we were paddling in sea and got frustrated when nobody seemed willing to look at a rock pool for more than two seconds.I was tired. I'd had a difficult week and although I thought I'd successfully compartmentalised the crappy bits of my life, it was increasingly clear that I hadn't. I decided to go for a walk.Amazingly, it only took less than a quarter of an hour of scrambling over boulders and wading through rockpools before I was completely alone. You would think that a beach that is in one of the most densely-populated parts of England would be completely packed on this, the first hot weekend of the year, but instead I felt like Charlton Heston at the end of Planet of the Apes.I walked eastwards along a wave cut platform. In the distance, Beachy Head lighthouse looked like a child's toy against the huge chalk cliffs. You can barely see it in this picture:I wanted to keep walking until I reached the lighthouse, but there was something slightly unnerving about being alone on a beach where the tide was coming in. The waves barely made a sound, but like the angels in Doctor Who, every time I turned around they seemed closer. I remained where I was, enjoying the microcosms of the rock pools.When the tide comes in, the beach disappears and it was disconcerting being completely alone in this transient landscape, as if I was at the end of things. It seemed so strange that there was no evidence of the human world, even though it was less than a mile away. But I was also grateful for the herd instinct that makes most people huddle together, leaving wide open spaces for those of us that need them.During moments like these, I find it hard not to look back at my life and wonder what I've achieved, but that way madness lies.I started walking back and was surprised to feel a sense of relief when I saw people again. A group of Russians were picnicking on some huge, limestone boulders that looked as if they had been arranged like seats. Further on, a rather suspicious-looking man in his late 50s sat alone, taking pictures of people on a camera with a very long zoom lens. I watched his camera follow the path of two adolescent girls in bikinis and wondered if I was jumping to conclusions about his motivation.In the distance, I saw my sons playing a ball game with my wife and her friend. They looked happy and relaxed, with the glow of people who had been outdoors for a few hours. Earlier I'd been wondering what I had achieved in my life.Here was the answer."},
{"title": "Decision Time for Dedalus", "date": "Thursday, May 20, 2010", "text": "In case you didn't know, the fate of Dedalus Books hangs in the balance.It would be a great tragedy if Dedalus lost their funding, as we need publishers of this kind more than ever. When Dedalus was formed, 27 years ago, there was no shortage of enlightened publishers that were willing to nuture and develop talented authors, regardless of the immediate financial return.Sadly, things are very different in today's risk-averse publishing world. It isn't even the obscure, literary novelists who will suffer, but also mainstream writers who have to write several books before they reach their breakthrough novel. Ian Rankin was with Orion for ten years before he started to become a \"name\".With a few exceptions, high culture isn't commercial. Nobody expects Radio Three or the Royal Opera House to produce a healthy net profit, but when it comes to the book world there seems to be a blind spot. That's probably because publishers used to be able to subsidise uncommercial books with the revenues from the latest Tom Clancy or Dick Francis. The Arts Council should to recognise that the publishing landscape has changed considerably and that public subsidy is essential for our literary culture.Gary Pulsifer of Arcadia neatly summed-up the importance of Dedalus:\"Dedalus operates on a shoe-string with one full-time member of staff,  yet produces classics of European and world literature, as well as  discovering new works of contemporary writing, some of which are  destined to be classics of the future.  Their outlook is serious yet  pleasurable and in this age of throw-away writing, they educate and  remind us that good books are a part of what drives a civilised society.\"I've copied an email that Dedalus sent to its supporters on Monday. If you want to add your voice to the campaign to restore Arts Council funding, there is an email address at the bottom:Dear Friend of Dedalus,             Re letter of  support  We are in negotiations with  Arts Council England (ACE) about reinstatement as a Regular Funded Organisation.  A recommendation will be made by Nick McDowell, Director of Literature on 24 May  and The Regional Council of ACE will consider this recommendation and our  response and take a decision on 29 June 2010. ACE has said it will, as part of  this process, consider third party letters of support. As ACE has specifically  asked for these testimonials it is clear that they consider them highly relevant  and that they might make it easier for ACE to reinstate  Dedalus. We  hope that you will consider providing Dedalus with such a letter and will write  to or email Nick McDowell. His address is: Nick  McDowell, Director of Literature                                                                                               ACE                                                                                                                                                 2,Pear Tree Court, London, EC1R 0DS                                                                                                email: nick.mcdowell@artscouncil.org.uk Please  send us a copy of your letter or email so we can include them in our final  submission to The Regional Council."},
{"title": "In Camera", "date": "Tuesday, May 18, 2010", "text": "During  the last week, I've found these photos hidden inside books:This  enigmatic triptych was (or is it were? Is triptych singular or plural?) neatly tucked away in a large, 1950s pictorial  tribute to the Everest expedition - an unlikely book to find them in,  but perhaps its size was the deciding factor as the prints are quite  large.

{"title": "Location, Location, Location", "date": "Sunday, May 16, 2010", "text": "Every now and then I get fed up with my house. It is charming and quirky, but it's very small and my dreams of having a workshop, keeping chickens and growing vegetables are impossible to fulfill here, so I find myself scanning the property pages for the perfect home. I need lebensraum.But, as Phil and Kirsty reminded me on last Thursday's episode of Location, Location, Location, unless you're in possession of a small fortune, you face a stark choice between having a nice house in a horrible town or vice versa. Days like today convince me that we made the right decision. This is the view is we walked into town:We were on our way to an \"eco fair\", which wasn't full of earnest people with beards and had some really interesting stalls about community projects and energy saving initiatives. I came away with a free low energy light bulb and a water-saving device for the cistern of our loo. I installed the water-saving bag as soon as I got home, but rather ruined things later by accidentally leaving the garden hose on for an hour.Events like the eco fair are typical of Lewes. The people here seem more concerned with the quality of life rather than the standard of living. In recent years, two large areas of land have become available for purchase and I've no doubt that in many towns, they would have been sold to developers. But not in Lewes.The first place - 25 acres of disused railway land - has been turned into a stunning nature reserve with marshes and woodland. The second - a large field - was earmarked by the county council as a car park for their staff, but local residents clubbed together and bought the land, making it available for everyone's use.Why is Lewes the exception rather than the norm? The history of architecture in postwar Britain makes depressing reading and I was interested to see this article in yesterday's Guardian Review about the critic Ian Nairn, who raged against the growth of \"subtopia\" (one good thing about the recession, according last Monday's Start the Week, is that there will be fewer building projects).After the eco-fair, we walked down to a district called Southover, to visit a \"Medieval Fayre\". I normally avoid anything where fair is written as fayre but this was very good and, to my great surprise, I discovered that I had a hiddent talent for archery:Admittedly, the woman in blue was a very good teacher, but I wasn't expecting to hit the target, let alone get a bullseye. At last, a sport that I'm good at! As soon as I got home, I seached on the internet for local archery clubs and found one in Brighton at a place called St Dunstan's, which I later discovered is for blind people. I had no idea that blind people could do archery. How does that work?When I got home, I picked up the local paper and had another look at the property pages. We could sell our house and buy something twice the size in the town where I work, but what would be the point if, the moment I opened the front door, my heart sank? In Lewes, I'm surrounded by beautiful countryside and many people who share the same values. Why would I want to leave?"},
{"title": "James Corbett", "date": "Thursday, May 13, 2010", "text": "On paper, the people in my department at work appear to be reasonably well qualified for their jobs: I have years of experience selling books for Waterstone's, Ottakar's and the independent sector, while my staff are English graduates with firsts and upper seconds. We live and breathe books.But the truth is that we know bugger all about most of the titles that we sell.Much of the time, we are not selling Eliot (George or T. S.). We are dealing with the bestsellers of the mid-20th century and 90% of the names mean nothing to us. I have never heard of Sidney Horler, Primrose Cumming or Peter Cheyney and yet in their time they were incredibly popular and the title pages bear witness to this, showing that the copy I'm holding is a 17th or 18th impression.Why are these writers now largely forgotten? The obvious answer is that their novels aren't good enough to stand the test of time. But is that true?Two weeks ago, I found a very obscure thriller by another writer I'd never heard of: James Corbett (1887-1958). It started promisingly enough:The dense prose style reminded me of Saramago. Perhaps I was on the verge of rediscovering a lost masterpiece. I continued reading...Sadly, \"Wednesday at Noon\" is one of the most ridiculous books I've ever read. It begins conventionally enough, with the mystery of a crime in a locked room, but then Corbett gradually loses the plot and the only truly criminal element in the novel is Corbett's completely implausible denouement, which seems to appear almost as an afterthought on the last couple of pages.In Corbett's world, the butler did it, but you didn't even know that the murder victim had a butler until page 257. This makes everything else in the narrative a red herring.In his time, James Corbett was a highly prolific writer of thrillers. Today, his books are out of print and there is almost nothing about him on the internet. I say almost, because he has acquired a cult following among a select band of readers for his remarkable writing style.Here are a few examples of Corbett's unique talent:Pritchard sat up like a full-blown geraniumAmazed inquiry sat on her faceIt was like looking for an ostrich in a forest of monkeys\"I think your philosophy deplorable\" Tessa murmured, with a sphinx-like groanHe was like a fish in deep waterThey knew the anticlimax was at hand, and their satisfaction was unbounded\"Your steps are feline and catlike\"It was a morning gown of blue silk, one that stressed her grace of figure and matched her complexionI found these examples on this website, which has a very amusing tribute to Corbett's genius.Now that I've taken the plunge, I intend to read more forgotten writers in the hope that one day, I'll rediscover a writer of genius. Watch this space."},
{"title": "Beyond Boring", "date": "Wednesday, May 12, 2010", "text": "There is a point at which things can be so boring that they become interesting again, thanks to the grim fascination they excite. That applies to people too. When I was a student, I had a temporary job as an assistant in a reference library. One of the members of staff was a man in his 50s called Gordon, whose only topic of conversation was the weight restrictions of different bridges in Richmond-upon-Thames.When I talked (or rather listened) to him, I felt as if I was having an out-of-body experience. Could someone really be talking about something so dull, without even a twinkle in their eye?I even wondered if the problem was mine. Did I lack a normal, natural curiosity about civil engineering issues? I was very young and still didn't know how the adult world worked, but I soon realised that the reason Gordon frequently talked to me was because everyone else had quietly sneaked out of the staff room within half a minute of his arrival.In hindsight, Gordon was probably on the autistic spectrum (and not in a good way).Today, I found a postcard that was so breathtakingly dull, that it made me wonder how it ever came to be printed:If you ever find yourself in Western Australia, make sure you pop into St Thomas More Catholic Church and Centre in Margaret River. As you can see, clockwise, they have a confessional, kitchen, toilet and showers and a morning Mass chapel.I would love to know what possessed someone to produce a postcard that included shots of stainless steel kitchen sinks and a bathroom. Perhaps civic pride produces a blinkered perspective.That would certainly seem to be the case in this postcard of Basingstoke:When I first saw this picture in the wonderful Phaidon book \"Boring Postcards\", I thought it was a joke. Who, in their right mind, would produce an official postcard of a town featuring images of scaffolding and hoardings? In one picture, there are hoardings on one side and a sale on the other, recalling the old Osacr Wilde (I think) quote about going from barbarism to decadence without civilisation in between.Presumably, several people saw this card before the print run was approved. I can only assume that Basinstoke is so awful (and apparently it is) that the council officials responsible for this card were inured to the images' ugliness.The Phaidon book also includes this picturesque view of Exeter Bus Station:And this enticing view of Solway Firth:I particularly liked this postcard:I seem to remember a grim holiday in a \"chalet\" when I was four-years-old, a few miles away from a nuclear power station. For chalet, read prefab, or gulag - these awful holiday camps were more like open prisons.However, this is my favourite image by far:It's a postcard of the place you're buying the postcard of the place you're buying a postcard of the place you're buying a postcard of the place you're buying a postacard...It's all done with mirrors. Why anyone would want to produce a postcard of the giftshop that sells postcards I don't know. In the hands of a conceptual artist, it could be a very amusing postmodern joke. But in this case, I suspect it's the work of someone who is interested in the weight restrictions of local bridges."},

Rather than view her as a victim, I regard Brenda as one of the great English eccentrics, blissfully indifferent to the social norms of 21st century Britain."},
{"title": "Rochester", "date": "Sunday, May 09, 2010", "text": "It was wet yesterday, so I decided to take my family to Rochester. The  alternative was an indoor soft-play centre - the sort where several  hundred children run around screaming while their parents sit drinking  coffee and reading the newspaper.I'm a big fan of drinking  coffee and reading newspapers, but my visits to the horribly named \"Monkey Bizness\" never quite go  according to plan and I usually end up having to sit in the soft-play  area, trying to dodge a succession of overweight children with poor  motor skills. Even worse, while these children's parents are enjoying  coffee and croissants, as the one grown-up present, I end up attracting a  string of hangers-on.I remember one occasion when a boy and his  two younger sisters decided to adopt me as a surrogate parent and  wouldn't leave me alone. \"Look at me. I can jump!\" said the boy for the  ninth time, as he leapt from a 15-inch high cube. I wanted to say \"Go  away, child. That's boring enough when my own children do it and I love them. I don't love you and I  want to read my paper, so shove off .\" But instead I just smiled  benignly and made encouraging noises.I must have been with  these children for the best part of an hour before their mother finally  appeared and when she did, all I received was a suspicious glare that  said, \"And why are you talking  to my children?\". Sadly, I hadn't perfected a return glare that could  have reminded her that whilst she was enjoying her Daily Mail and latte (which she would  have called a lar-tay), I  was working as an unpaid childminder, being bored to death by her  children.To add insult to injury, in the seven seconds it took  for me to put my belongings in a bag, my youngest son managed to escape  from a supposedly baby-proof enclosure and merge into a crowd of 300 people. The ten minutes it took to find him were among the  longest in my life.So that's why soft-play centres are out.Rochester,  on the other hand, has a medieval castle, a very good museum with free  entry and lots of hands-on exhibits, plus a cathedral with some fairly  spooky cloisters. That might sound terribly worthy, but boredom is good  for children.Given the choice, my sons would always choose to  visit a theme park or zoo, but in the slightly more austere surroundings  of a ruined castle, they often end up having more fun, using their  imaginations rather than being spoon-fed a succession of experiences.Officially a  city, Rochester is, in reality, a tiny enclave of olde England, sandwiched between two towns of  unremitting ugliness. Rochester likes to trade on its Charles Dickens  connection. Many of the shops, like Pip's  Bakery, alude to Dickens and even the local Indian restaurant is  called \"A Taste of Two Cities\",  but the Dickensian atmosphere is slightly ruined by the constant roar  of traffic thundering to and from neighbouring Chatham.There is  no discernible boundary between Rochester and Chatham from the air, but  on the ground it is quite a different matter. One minute you are walking  past genteel restaurants and half-timbered houses, the next, you are  surrounded by people in hoodies with the tell-tale rodent-like faces of  foetal-alcohol syndrome. The sudden change reminded me of the time I  unwittingly entered the Tenderloin district of San Francisco.There  were some strange shops in Rochester, including a charity shop called \"Hospices of Hope\" (I thought that  hospices were where you went when all hope was lost) and an art gallery,  which, in addition to the usual insipid landscapes, had pictures by  Banksy for sale:Are  these official Banksys? A few years ago, it would have been a typically  subversive gesture of Banksy to place his art alongside paintings of  country cottages and sailing ships. Has he completely sold out? On the strength of this encounter, perhaps we can now expect to see  limited-edition prints on sale in the Mail  on Sunday?The museum was a success, mainly thanks to an  exhibit which allowed my sons to control the local CCTV cameras and spy  on the locals. The zoom function had a scarily good resolution, to the  point where I felt like a rather unsavoury voyeur. Never again will I  confidently perform dance moves from West  Side Story in empty car parks.After the museum we tried  to visit the cathedral, but our route was blocked by a military parade.  Apparently it was the 150th annivesary of the Kent Cadets and I  overheard a steward saying that there were several V.V.I.Ps present. Here they are, applauding the cadets:I don't  know why these people were classified as very very important people, but I was very taken with the  moustache of the gentleman in the middle:Although  I prefer to be clean-shaven, I do enjoy facial hair in other people,  male or female. I remember a woman in Richmond who, in addition to  wearing a striking leopardskin coat and bright red lipstick, sported a  fine black beard. As fashion statements go, she made Vivienne Westwood  look like Iris Murdoch.A service of thanksgiving was about to  begin and the cadets filed into Rochester Cathedral, watched impassively  by this weathered figure:There  was something both very poignant and slightly absurd about the sight of  hundreds of teenagers in military uniform, marching past a small group  of World War Two veterans into a 900-year-old cathedral. Tradition and  continuity. A century ago, it would have been all too easy to feel  unmitigated pride and admiration at a sight like this, but that was  before the Somme took away people's innocence.Everyone slept on  the drive home - was Rochester that enervating? I listened to a review  of David Mitchell's new novel \"The  Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet\" and was disappointed to hear  mostly negative comments. I shall have to wait for John Self to review it. Two  of the best books I've read this year were recommended on the Asylum blog and I'm not  surprised that John's status as a reviewer has grown to the point where  he's now quoted in the Sunday Times.As we reached Lewes, my wife dutifully said, \"Let's thank Dad for a  lovely day.\" I heard muted, half-hearted responses from the back. Later,  my oldest son said \"It wasn't that interesting. In fact it was quite  boring. Next Saturday, please don't try and find any other places to go  to, because Rochester was rubbish.\""},
{"title": "Paul Nash", "date": "Thursday, May 06, 2010", "text": "Today I took an absurdly convoluted journey to Dulwich, involving two trains and a tram, to see the Paul Nash exhibition. I almost missed it, but fortunately Lucille warned me that it was finishing this Sunday. Given that the last Nash retrospective was apparently over 60 years ago, not going wasn't an option.The Paul Nash exhibition has been incredibly successfully, both with the critics and public. It's hard to believe that Nash struggled to make a living from his art and lived in genteel poverty, dying at the relatively young age of 57. Why is he so popular today?In his day, Nash was one of the \"moderns\" and his surrealist paintings, with their weird juxtapositions of landscapes and objects, wouldn't have been everyone's cup of tea. But today, his paintings seem terribly English, belonging to a pastoral tradition that goes back to Blake and Palmer.I was really impressed by the exhibition, but it was far too busy and it was an effort to look at any of the paintings without being distracted by other people.I seemed to be the youngest person there by at least ten years. Hadn't anyone else bunked off work to see some paintings?All of the usual suspects were there: retired bachelors with bald heads and a profusion of ear hair; earnest-looking members of art appreciation societies; ruddy-faced port drinkers in lambswool sweaters and chinos; women in their 80s with white bobbed hair and piercing eyes.Fortunately, almost everyone behaved impeccably. Nobody walked in front of me when I was looking at a painting and there were very few people who insisted on leaning forward and inspecting the brush strokes from a distance of six inches.But there is one sub-group I haven't mentioned. These people are a menace and have plagued me for years. If I had my way, I would only allow them to visit art galleries during specified hours - perhaps between 10.00 and 11.00 on Tuesday mornings.They travel in pairs. One is a self-appointed art expert and likes to think of herself as a bit of a character, confidently issuing one platitude after another. The other usually nods and hums in agreement. Nobody would dare to start chatting in a concert but no-one seems to bat an eyelid when someone starts talking at full volume in an art gallery.There were a few chatting pairs, including one woman who was enthusiastically comparing a painting to the movie Inkheart, but luckily this didn't detract from the exhibition:The exhibition was a curatorial triumph, with twice as many exhibits than I'd expected. It's a great pity that it had to end, as it was far more interesting than the Dulwich Picture Gallery's permanent collection of old masters.Two hours later, I was back in Lewes. My walk home from the station took me past the gardens of Southover Grange - a Tudor house that was built out of the ruins of a medieval monastry. It was one of the first really warm spring days and the gardens were full of people enjoying the sun after the long winter.It looked so idyllic, that I decided to make this short film. The quality isn't great and the music, which I wrote and recorded for a play a long time ago, is a bit wobbly,but I hope it captures some of the essence of the gardens:"},
{"title": "Yesterday", "date": "Sunday, May 02, 2010", "text": "After a fairly challenging week of depressing letters from the bank, ill  health and bad news at work, I was determined to enjoy my weekend. \"I want to go to  Hastings.\" I announced. Everyone groaned, particularly my wife.What  has she got against Hastings? My wife has never been there and yet  every time I suggest a family outing to Hastings, the idea is swiftly  vetoed. I suspected ignorance rather than simple blind prejudice and  this was confirmed when, as we entered the town, my wife exclaimed \"Oh, I  didn't know it was by by the sea.\"I had dragged three people  kicking and screaming (literally, in the case of one) to Hastings and as  I parked the car, I couldn't help wondering why I'd bothered. But I  still had faith that Hastings would work its magic and the moment we got  out of the car, I perceived a slow but tangible thaw in the mood.I have  written about Hastings before  and yesterday's visit didn't prompt me to revise my opinion. I still  noticed an unusually high number of mishapen faces, some of which seemed  to be the result of fist fights or car crashes. I also spotted an  unusually high number of dog owners.And where else but Hastings would you find Morris dancers outside a  tattoo parlour?The quirky eccentricity of Hastings is irresistible and after  five hours there I had two happy children and a penitent wife.  What more could anyone ask for?But the day wasn't over yet. In  the evening, I met another blogger - The Poet Laura-eate -  and her friend Terry, who were visiting Lewes for the weekend. Like my  recent meeting with Oliver,  it was a very enjoyable evening and I only wish that Laura and Terry  lived a little nearer, as our two-hour drink at The Lamb went far too  quickly. I hope we have a chance to meet again."},

{"title": "Ordinary Lives", "date": "Saturday, April 24, 2010", "text": "As much as I love working with books, it is the paraphernalia that comes  with them which really excites me. Hidden in a novel that is trying to  encapsulate the human condition, I often find a photograph or note which  manages to say more in a simple image or sentence than most authors  could achieve in 200 pages.That's not a slur against writers.  It's more about authenticity and intent. Photograph albums tell us so  much and so little at the same time. The albums lie, in that they create  a completey false impression of lives lived in perpetual happiness and  sunshine, but each photo is unintentionally revealing. Behind the smiles  and blue skies, there is a subtext: this  is what I want my life to be.The gulf between the people  we'd like to be and who we actually are is pure Richard Yates.Last  week I came across a family's photo album, which had probably arrived at our  warehouse because it was book-shaped.The album is the story of  this woman, who was a keen dog breeder:At some  point in the late 1940s, she marries a man who shares her passion for  dogs and they move here:This  bungalow is typical of the poor quality, jerry-built housing that  flourished in Britain until more rigorous planning legislation was  introduced. Today it is next to some dog kennels. Perhaps the husband  and wife were responsible for establishing their home and the kennels.From  the photo album, it is clear that dogs were almost their whole life:Indeed,  over half of the the album consists of photos of dogs. But in between  breeding dogs, the couple managed to find the time to have two children:  a boy and a girl. Here is their young daughter in the late 1960s:And  here is their son:There  is no discernible chronology to the album. Events in the daughter's life  - graduation, marriage and the birth of a child - are presented in a  random order and both children are eclipsed by the numerous photos from  dog shows:The  woman and her husband must have been well-known figures in the dog  breeding world and many of the photos are official portraits from shows,  where they had won first prize.Were they a happy family? Aside  from the fact that the dogs seem to take centre stage in the album,  there is nothing unusual about the photos of family gatherings and  boating holidays. These are ordinary people who seem at ease with  themelves.But then I turned the page and saw this:On the  same page, there is a photograph of a gravestone. It is their son's.Another  newspaper cutting reads: \"Our dearest  son and brother died after much suffering. You were so very brave and  were greatly missed.\"The album ends here. There are no  more pictures of dog shows or boating holidays. As far as I can tell,  the couple lived for many years after their son's death, but they chose  to end their album with this photo:I had  been complacently flicking through the album, enjoying the 1960s  fashions and scenes from dog shows. Nothing prepared me for the shock of  the final page.I went back through the album, and photographs that had once appeared  rather comical now seemed terribly poignant. These innocent, smiling  faces had no idea what was in store for them."},
{"title": "Victorian Values", "date": "Wednesday, April 21, 2010", "text": "Curmudgeons who moan about bloggers and Wikipedia argue that the  democratic nature of the web has allowed ill-informed, ordinary people  to flood the internet with their half-baked ideas. The age of the expert  is behind us. We now live in a pseudo-democratic, dumbed-down world in  which everyone's opinion has value (\"And  Colin from Nuneaton has texted us to say that he thinks that the way to  stop sexual offences is for women to dress less provocatively.\")I  disagree. I've tried spreading my half-baked ideas and discovered that  there's always some smart alec out there who is ready to correct me. As  for Wikipedia, if I dare to edit any articles without copious references  to source material, it's altered within a couple of days by someone in  Canada. Why Canada?The late Victorian era was the true age of  the charlatan, when anyone with a passing interest in phrenology and an  impressive beard could make sweeping pronouncements about any subject  that took their fancy.Yesterday I found a wonderful book called \"Vital Force, or Evils and Remedies of  Perverted Sexuality\" by \"Prof\" R. B. D. Wells, the \"Practical  Phrenologist\" and proprietor of a \"hydropathic establishment\" in  Scarborough. It is an utterly mad book.The book begins with a  brief description of Mr Wells' establishment which could be \"reached with facility in a few minutes'  walk from the Railway Station\". We are told that this building  has a \"commanding view of the  surrounding scenery\" and can accomodate 250 patients and  visitors. \"Those ordering Mr Wells'  books should make postal orders and cheques payable to R. B. D. Wells.  The telegraphic and postal address is Professor Wells, Scarborough.\"What  sort of people did Professor Wells treat? Certainly not this gentleman:In my  day, these people were called students. In the Professor's time, louche  characters like this were beyond his help, as were these sorry specimens  from the underclass:  However, Professor Wells was able to offer treatment to paying gentlemen  like these:It's  not all mad. In his more enlightened moments the Professor encourages  men to ensure that their wives also experience sexual pleasure and he  argues that scolding and hitting small children is counter-productive.  But these moments of sanity are few and far between.Here is a  random selection of the wisdom of Professor Wells:Novel reading is stimulating and should be avoided inasmuch as  it excites the imagination and fills the mind with voluptuous ideasFat women have inflamed passions, but the sexual act has not so  electrifying an effect on them as it has upon those who are more  naturally constitutedAn effeminate man  should marry a masculine woman; but it would not be advisable for this  contrast to be carried to an extreme, by a very effeminate man marrying a  large, stately, fleshy and masculine woman.Has the reader ever thought how it is that sailors' wives so  long retain their youthful charms of good looks? It is because they have  long periods of rest during their husband's absence, which enables them  to recruit their sexual energies.Men and women  of strong sexual natures have generally powerful and deep voices. It is a  sign of impaired or disturbed sexual vigour when the voice becomes  husky and rough, or shrill and piping.Men who have thick, full necks and penetrating eyes are  generally strong in their sexual nature.Extra  large men are not so well sexed, which accounts for the fact that giants  have very little sexual power.When we look  around us we find that strong, robust men, who are full of life and  vigour, usually become parents of sons rather than daughters, especially  at the commencement of their married life; and as their life advances  and vigour decreases there will generally be found a preponderance of  daughters.It is the bounden duty of every man  to marry before he is thirty years of age; especially considering that  there are so many women in the land whose hearts yearn for sympathy, and  who need the protection and advice of the masculine gender.Nine  sweeping statements that seem utterly absurd to the modern reader. But I  will finish with one very sane and forward-thinking statement from  Professor Wells:Husbands too frequently consider that the  marriage ceremony gives them a free license to indulge as frequently as  they like in sexual enjoyment. Many a married man has virtually  committed rape upon his wife, and although the crime may be unrecogised  as such by the law, it is none the less a fact.I wouldn't be at all  surprised if many Victorian readers found the concept of marital rape  one of the more fanciful ideas, compared to the sound, commonsense  statements that arose from the \"science\" of phrenology. But I couldn't  back-up my opinion with facts.Like Professor Wells, I'm not an  expert."},
{"title": "An Arundel Tomb", "date": "Thursday, April 15, 2010", "text": "Yesterday I drove to Chichester to meet someone who had some books to  sell. I only had half an hour to spare, but I managed to squeeze in a  visit to the cathedral:The  cathedral is beautiful by any standards, but what makes it particularly  stunning is its successful blending of the ancient and modern, thanks to  the extraordinary vision of George Bell and Walter Hussey.I love  the way that medieval tombs sit alongside bold, Cubist-inspired  tapestries. I know that these contemporary works of art ruffled a few  feathers when they were installed, but nearly 50 years on, they seem  perfectly at home. Bishop Bell's vision has ensured that the Cathedral  is a living church rather than a museum piece.When I  returned to work, I tried to convey the excitement of Chichester  Cathedral. \"They've got a Marc Chagall window!\"\"Who's Marc  Chagall?\" came the reply.I had forgotten myself. Most of the  time, my work persona is an amiable, two-dimensional caricature - one  that allows people to fill in the blanks themselves. When people ask me  what I'm doing at the weekend, I lie. It's much easier to say, with a  world-weary sigh, that you're taking the 'kids' to the Sea Life Centre (\"Isn't it expensive these days!\")  rather than talking about the new Paul Nash exhibition that you want to  see. Paul Who?Sometimes I wish I'd stayed in London.However,  it's not all bleak. I now have some bright young things working for me  who want to talk about more than last night's match. I'm sure that they  would appreciate this:The  medieval Arundel Tomb is remarkable. I have written about it before here,  three years ago and quoted the full Philip Larkin poem, with its  beautiful last line, \"What will  survive of us is love\".Chichester is nice. It has plenty  of historic buildings and even the local Marks and Spencer appears to  have had some sort of preservation order imposed on it. I haven't seen this  font for years:But I  wouldn't want to live there. Perhaps that's because I associate the  place with Waterstone's.When Ottakar's was bought by HMV, my  shop became part of a new Waterstone's area and I was required to attend  monthly regional meetings at the Chichester branch. They were not happy  occasions. I had left Waterstone's in 1994, vowing that I'd never work  for them again. Suddenly, without my consent, I was back and this  Waterstone's was far worse than the company I'd left 12 years earlier.As  Waterstone's managers had gradually had their autonomy eroded by a  succession of retailers, the meetings had a very limited scope. We  discussed burning issues like \"How can we successfully promote the new  loyalty card?\" or \"What's the best way to make people buy Waterstone's  gift cards instead of Book Tokens?\"After enduring several hours  of trivia, I used to sneek across the road to Chichester Cathedral and  look at the Arunel Tomb. Every time I looked at the 700-year-old stone  carvings, I felt grounded. The ephemeral nonsense of loyalty cards and  campaign changeover would pass. The things that really mattered would  remain.Here is Philip Larkin himself, reading An  Arundel Tomb..."},

As usual, there was no information about the photo and there wasn't even a tenuous link between the book and the image.And on the subject of Classical nudes:What was it with the 1960s?

{"title": "Censorship", "date": "Friday, April 02, 2010", "text": "Several months ago I found a fascinating book, hidden in a box full  of mildewy titles about algebra and geometry. Published in Stuttgart in  1938, Deutschlands Autobahnen  can best be described as a Nazi \"coffee-table\" book about Hitler's  road-building programme and, in addition to over 200 pages of text, it has  many stunning photographs and full-colour maps.A quick internet  search revealed only one other copy on sale, for over £100. I decided  that £89 would be a fair price and wrote a long description in English  and German (courtesy of Google translate, I hasten to add).I was  confident that the book would sell within days.After two weeks  with no offers or enquiries, I decided to check if my Google-translated  German had unwittingly come out as something like \"All pages are made of  jelly\" because it didn't make sense that such a rare title  hadn't sold. I checked, using different combinations of title, author and date.The book had never gone on sale.As it wasn't unusual for my  software designers to mess things up, I decided that it  would be quicker to list the book again, with a shorter, umlaut-free  description. Once again, the book failed to appear on sale, even though  titles that I'd logged before and after had uploaded without any  problem.Eventually, I discovered that many internet bookselling  platforms like AbeBooks won't allow people to list titles about Hitler if they were written and published in Nazi Germany. Apparently, my book  about motorways of the Third Reich had been automatically deleted.This  sort of censorship is both heavy-handed and inappropriate. I do not need the likes of eBay to protect me from the apparently seductive forces of Naziism or second guess why I am purchasing a particular title. I am a grown-up.I thought that banning books was more Hitler's style.In the meantime, here are some remarkable photographs from another book that I'm not allowed to sell: a 1936 hagiography called, simply, Adolf Hitler.

Of course there will be people out there who are attracted to material of this kind for the wrong reasons, but that doesn't justify banning books.There are occasions when censorship can be a necessary evil, to safeguard the civil liberties of the vulnerable.

In their time, they were incredibly successful, but by the mid-1960s they had disappeared from view.At a glance, it looks as if some sort of literary Stalinist purge has taken place, but the reality is a combination of changing fashions and writers dying of old age. Nevertheless, there seem to be distinct geological periods in literature that are defined more by the forgotten authors than the ones we remember. Howard Spring and Warwick Deeping belong to the interwar years, whilst Silas Hocking and Mrs Henry Wood are indelibly linked to the late Victorian period.I almost sound as if I know what I'm talking about. It is amazing how quickly I have gone from being a complete charlatan to someone who can convey an air of authority when talking about rare and antiquarian books.Only last week, I received a phone call from a man whose grandparents had just died. He wanted me to value their books and, flattered by the prospect of behaving like an Antiques Roadshow expert, I agreed to pay him a visit later that day (perhaps I should have enquired how his grandparents came to die at the same time, but I did at least leave his address with my colleagues in case I never returned).Today I discovered a new author: Harry Stephen Keeler, described by Wikipedia as a \"prolific but little-known American author.\"I don't think I'll ever read \"The Tiger Snake\", but it has some cracking chapter headings that read like the plot of a Gay Men's Press novel:Queer BusinessThe \"Man-Trap\" The Hand From Out The DarkA QuandryMr Smock ReceivesInformation From an M.D.As for Mr Keeler, he seems to have hit on a novel solution (no pun intended) to the problem of a receeding hairline:"},
{"title": "King's Bishop to Pawn*", "date": "Sunday, March 28, 2010", "text": "Yesterday evening I was desperately trying to read an article by Rupert Thomson in the Guardian Weekend magazine, but my wife had other ideas:\"Jenny's suggested that we all go to the zoo.\"\"Hmm?\"\"It would be lovely for the children and I think you'd get on with Dave.\"\"Hmm. Good idea.\" (at this point I pointedly picked up the magazine to indicate that the conversation was over.\"Dave often plays chess with his next door neighbour. They're nudists.\"\"Hmmm.\"\"Yes, when Dave goes round there for a game, the neighbour isn't wearing any clothes.\"At this point, I thought that my wife was employing a tried and tested technique to see if I was listening to her but no, apparently Dave really does play chess with a naked man. The neighbours are nudists and their house rules are simple: no clothes. Dave never bats an eyelid.I'm not sure if I'd be quite so relaxed about naked chess, or indeed anything that involved nudity, but perhaps I'm in the minority. Several people at work have posted rather revealing photos of themselves on Facebook.Two weeks ago, a girl who works in our warehouse paid to have some \"glamour\" photos taken of her and her sister. I'm sure you can picture the scene: two teenage girls, one seedy, middle-aged photographer and a studio that looks like something out of a 1970s porn film.The session began with some harmless, slightly revealing poses. Then the photographer opened a bottle of wine and encouraged the girls to have a glass or two. Soon, inhibitions (and clothes) were quickly shed and with minutes, the sisters wearing nothing but a smile.I can understand how the combination of youth, flattery and alcohol helped to remove any inhibitions about posing naked. What I can't understand is why, in the cold sober light of the next day, the photo session was posted by one of the sisters on Facebook for everyone to see.This is one of the milder shots:Apparently, the photographer told the girl that he had \"contacts\" who might be able to offer her solo, webcam work. That registers 9.5 on the seedometer.Another colleague, in a moment of madness, decided to post a profile picture of himself on Facebook, standing in a shower. Admittedly, he'd covered his offending articles with a towel, but in a pose that made him look like the poor man's Tom of Finland. He was universally ridiculed.With so much nudity around, I'm beginning to wonder if I'm in a minority. Are more people at it than I realised?I sincerely hope not because, with the best will in the world, most people look better with their clothes on.*This post was originally called \"King's Bishop to Porn\" - I forgot about search engines."},
{"title": "Martin Amis", "date": "Monday, March 22, 2010", "text": "Poor old Martin Amis. He's so easy to dislike, partly because of his ridiculous bad boy persona (cultivated against a backdrop of privilege and opportunity), but mainly because he takes himself so seriously.I admit that I'm prejudiced. When I became a bookseller, Amis was one of a generation of writers who were portrayed as young and edgy - more American than British - capturing the late 20th century zeitgeist. The reality was a small group of nice, upper-middle class men in their 40s, writing fiction that was technically innovative, but ultimately unsatisfying.Turn the clock back to the mid-1990s and Martin Amis was at the top of his game: still the enfant terrible of British writers, but with a beautiful new wife, new teeth and a £500,000 advance from HarperCollins. Then, as in many great novels, hubris was followed by downfall.The Information was Amis's first novel for HarperCollins. It was a disaster. It had been decided that as Amis was such a strong \"brand\", the usual convention of having the title and author on the dustjacket would be abandoned. Instead, there would be a simple \"i\".Unfortunately, less wasn't more and the novel flopped. It's hard to tell how many sales were lost as a result of the bold cover design, but I think it's safe to say that HarperCollins didn't recoup their advance for a long time (if ever). In spite of this fiasco, the creative team behind the \"i\" still won an industry award.The pendulum seems to have swung in the opposite direction since The Information. Amis is frequently caricatured as the young pretender who sold his soul for the Murdoch shilling to buy new teeth. Every new work seems to prompt a spate of vitriolic views.The reason I'm writing this is because I found a copy of Amis's memoir Experience the other day, lying on top of a skip. It was a perfectly good copy, but because its sales ranking on Amazon was so low, it was about the be pulped. I picked it up and saw this passage:\"On a tube train to Earl's Court I saw a young man reading The Rachel Papers, about a week after its publication. He was enjoing the book, and in the best possible way: a reluctant smile, an unreluctant smile, a reluctant smile, and so on. I still regret that I didn't go up to him. But I told myself: listen, this will be happening all the time - get used to it.\"I immediately thought \"Typical Martin Amis. Bloody arrogant...\" and almost threw the book back into the skip. If I had, I would have missed the next sentence:\"I need hardly add that it didn't happen again for about fifteen years. When my first novel won the Somerset Maugham Award I told myself the same sort of thing: get used to it. And that never happened again.\""},

{"title": "Hampton Court Palace", "date": "Monday, March 15, 2010", "text": "One year, I made the mistake of buying family membership of the National Trust. I'm sure there are children who love visiting historic buildings, but I suspect that most are bored rigid and can't wait until it's time to visit the gift shop.When I told my oldest son that we were going to Hampton Court Palace before visiting Grandma, he was nonplussed. \"Do you know, Henry VIII used to live there!\" I added, naively thinking that this would make a difference.My son sighed and rolled his eyes.I was just about to launch into my standard \"Well we're going there anyway\" routine, when I suddenly had a brainwave. \"You do know that it's haunted, don't you? Look at this YouTube clip...\"By the end of the clip, my son solemnly concluded that \"it must be true\" and decided that on reflection, he would like to visit Hampton Court Palace.I should have quit while I was ahead, but ended up over-egging the paranormal pudding to the point where both sons were in a state of mortal terror. My wife gave me one of her \"Now look what you've done\" expressions.By the next day, my sons seemed to have forgotten their fear - I think they were too preoccupied with feeling travelsick - and I dared to hope that the visit would go smoothly.It was still fairly quiet when we arrived and although I don't believe in ghosts, the oldest parts of Hampton Court had an incredible presence. As we entered the huge Tudor kitchen, I saw a strange, ghostly figure with a white beard, standing by the fire:It turned out to be Warren - someone I used to work with at Waterstone's when it was still owned by Tim Waterstone. Warren didn't suffer fools gladly and could be spectacularly rude to customers that incurred his wrath. He worked on the top floor and I often remember people walking down the stairs in a stunned silence, unable to process what had just happened to them.But when he wasn't assaulting the Daily Mail-reading Betty Shine fans, Warren could be great fun to work with. One day an extremely malodorous tramp entered the shop and started shouting at people in Welsh, before knocking over a display of books. Warren turned to the queue of customers and calmly said \"Oh I do wish my father wouldn't visit me in the shop.\"How did Warren end up working in Hampton Court Palace? Watching him talking to the visitors he seemed a different man: affable, relaxed and unfazed by even the most banal questions.I almost didn't manage to speak to Warren. He had been cornered by a man with a strange face, who was asking him one question after another. Later I remembered that this very man had stopped me having another conversation with someone fourteen years ago, when I ran a bookshop in Twickenham. Now that is spooky.We continued exloring the palace and by now, my sons were imbuing every unfamiliar noise and sudden change in temperature with ghostly origins.Given my scepticism about the supernatural, I felt slightly hypocritical encouraging a state of semi-hysteria and was about to start backtracking with rational explanations when my wife appeared with a man in Tudor costume. \"Look boys, this man works here and he can tell you all about the ghosts.\"I cringed with embarrassment.  I only have to casually wonder how old something is and without any warning, my wife will track down the nearest member of staff and ask them. I'm a man. I don't ask questions, even if it means driving around a ring road seven times.To my surprise, the Tudor guard was more than happy to talk, albeit in a conspiratorial whisper:\"I've worked here 20 years and a lot of strange things go on here. Sometimes a strange smell will appear and suddenly disappear for no reason, other times it could be a noise, or someone tapping you on the shoulder when there's no-one else in the room. One time we saw some ropes spinning round...\"The boys were lapping it up, but had they learned any history? I don't know, but all I can do is expose them to as much of their heritage as possible so that they can get a better perspective on their own time.As for the ghosts, perhaps my sons are right. Can you see the strange apparition in this photo?Our visit concluded with a visit to the gift shop, where visitors could buy ye olde chocolate chippe biscuits and other traditional English \"fayre\", like this:In my ignorance, I thought that tea wasn't introduced to Britain until the 17th century. I stand corrected.I always become terribly grumpy in gift shops, appalled by the mass-produced kitsch that masquerades as \"heritage\". On the other hand, I remember the disappointment I felt as a child when someone gave me a tasteful, hand-crafted replica of a Tudor board game. You can't win."},
{"title": "More From Derek's Diaries", "date": "Sunday, March 14, 2010", "text": "As regular readers of this blog may know, last month I came across a large box of personal journals, written by a former local government officer called Derek (left). If I hadn't been passing through the warehouse just after Derek's diaries arrived, I've no doubt that they would have been promptly binned. They are of no value.I couldn't bring myself to throw four decades of a person's life into a bin and I am now stuck with the box, making excuses every time someone asks me what I'm going to do with it. I honestly have no idea.I've now read several of Derek's diaries and although it feels rather voyeuristic, I hope I am that sympthetic, unknown reader that most of us hope for when we write.It is hard not feel sympathy for Derek. He emerges from his writing as a compassionate, thoughtful person, with an unswerving loyalty to his faith, family and friends. But what makes Derek's journals so compelling is that he is a man plagued by passions and dark thoughts (\"I am a laughing man with tears behind the smile.\")Derek dreams of behaving in an \"improper\" manner towards his female colleagues. He is also an incurable hypochondriac, plagued by an endless succession of minor complaints:\"I have a headache and I am tired. And flies, black flies, are killing my gladioli. They are laying their eggs inside the flowers as the devil lays temptation in a man's mind: both are destructive.\"\"Brenda came to me. For a while we lay upon the lawn, but decided to evacuate when a caterpilla crawled onto my hand. Brenda hates insects. So do I.\"I also enjoy passages like these, which seem to appear at random:\"Satan came to me last night in the form of Edward Chave. When I brought up the question of him boring his children...he rose to his feet, put on his hat and stormed out of the house.\"\"Once the coach party was over, I asked Vic Lipppett to accompany me to the station as I was carrying about £200 worth of equipment and didn't fancy being mugged in the underground passage. As we were walking across, he opened his coat and showed how well-prepared he was; he had a revolver tucked into his trousers. Whether he had a licence for it I do not know.\"\"I looked at frilly nightdresses and underclothes today in a shop window.  I had a strong urge to buy them all for Brenda.\"In a telling entry, Derek writes that his journals \"make me squirm when I read them. They are full of self-pity, mawkish sentiment, selfish opinions and abysmal writing. Were it not that I truly believe that the child is the father of the man, I would confine those journals to the fire.\"In another passage, Derek talks about posterity. I'm glad he never knew what posterity had in store for his writing.Outwardly, Derek led a fairly unremarkable life, but his diaries bear witness to the quiet heroism that pervades the lives of many ordinary people. I don't think I'll ever be able to throw them away.N.B - I have tried to donate Derek's diaries to an archive, but so far haven't had any success."},

{"title": "A Very Tight Corner with a Lynx-Eyed Man", "date": "Thursday, March 11, 2010", "text": "I found this very rare children's novel yesterday:It's pure \"Boy's Own\": lots of \"I say chaps! This is jolly unfair. I vote we give the rotter a taste of his own medicine.\"Best of all are the chapter headings:A Queer Arrival  A Little Scrap Tony Gets Busy Tony Takes a Chance A Midnight Adventure The Manacled Ghost A Radio Thrill The Super-Tuck Shop A Very Tight Corner Not a Joke The 'Phone MessageThe Curio ShopA Lynx-Eyed ManA Stern ChaseThe RescueChumsI'd love to visit the \"Super-Tuck\" shop and as for stern chases, I know all about those from Sheerness.What struck me about the chapter headings was that although the book is probably complete rubbish, it has a pace and melodrama that many of the worthier children's novels of the post-war era lack. I've no doubt that the success of the Harry Potter books is partly down to the fact that they are old-fashioned, plot-driven novels.Last year I read the complete Five Find-Outers series to my oldest son and even though I knew that Enid Blyton was no Michael Morpurgo, I had forgotten just how badly written her books were. However, in spite of myself, I had to find out who the shadowy figure in the window of the deserted cottage was.Why one two-dimensional, cliche-ridden children's novel should be out of print while another is a classic, is a mystery. Many of the books I deal with by forgotten novelists went through several reprints in their own time. I'm sure that if some of them were reissueed today, they would find a new audience.However, in spite of its racy chapter headings, I don't think we'll be seeing a new Puffin edition of \"The Lion's Whelp at School\"."},
{"title": "Saturday in Kent", "date": "Monday, March 08, 2010", "text": "Parenthood has made me a man of modest ambitions. Once, a birthday would have involved a trip to Chile or a weekend in Paris, but these days I feel lucky if I can spend a whole day without having to repair something, look after children or take things to the local recycling centre.When my wife asked me what I wanted for my birthday last week, I said that I wanted to spend a day exploring Kent (it's come to that). I only had one destination in mind. The rest of the day would be spent wandering aimlessly, allowing serendipity to take its course.It all seemed simple enough. Little did I know that I'd end up almost being arrested under the anti-terrorist laws.I began the day in Aylesford, a Medway village where nothing of any significance has happened since the year 455. In the summer, Aylesford can look like a traditional, picture postcard English village, but today it was eerily quiet.I had come here to visit the church. Generations of my ancestors had been christened, married and buried at St Peter's Church. I wanted to visit the church and have my Kunta Kinte (or Kunta Kente) moment. It never occured to me that St Peter's would be locked.I rattled the door, hoping that there would be somebody inside, but there were no lights on in the church. I wandered round the graveyard, wondering if I might be able to pick out a familar name, but the older stones were too badly weathered. It was bitterly cold and after two circuits of the graveyard I decided to leave.Suddenly, the church bell started to ring and I began counting: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13... Why hadn't the ringing stopped at twelve? Assuming that someone must now be inside the church, I walked over to the door and saw that it was still locked and no lights were on. The bell rang 47 times.Standing in a cold, windswept graveyard, listening to a bell ringing in an empty church, made me feel as if I was in an M. R. James short story.A mile to the north of Aylesford, there are the remains of a Neolithic burial chamber. Kit's Coty is very hard to find. There are no brown heritage signs pointing the way and I wasted the best part of an hour before I managed to find the site, but it was worth the effort:The confusingly named Kit's Coty House may not be Stonehenge, but does it deserve its current status, unvisited by all but a few, surrounded by an ugly fence?Kit's Coty was originally covered by a mound of earth and a 50-foot tunnel led to a burial chamber. Despite its primitive appearance, it was a considerable feat of engineering to lift the huge capstone over eight feet off the ground. Who knows, perhaps my ancestors helped to build it.The stones are pockmarked with small holes:These holes have become very popular with the local snails:Kit's Coty definitely had a presence and I found myself agreeing with Samuel Pepys:\"Three great stones standing upright and a great round one lying on them, of great bigness, although not so big as those on Salisbury Plain. But certainly it is a thing of great antiquity, and I am mightily glad to see it.\"My next visit was to another forgotten place: the Isle of Sheppey. Formerly home to a Royal Naval dockyard and passenger-ferry terminal, Sheppey is now an economically depressed area, with cheap, badly built housing estates, scattered across a desolate landscape of mudflats and electricity pylons.The Isle of Sheppey is less than 40 miles from London, but I felt as if I had travelled to some rather unpleasant part of Eastern Europe in the 1970s.The main town, Sheerness appears to be almost exclusively populated by shabbily dressed people with a BMI of over 35 and, although the town centre had an Aldi and a Superdrug, most retail chains had decided to give the place a miss. I felt that if I got out of my car, a zombie-style mob would chase after me, albeit rather slowly.Once I was safely away from the crowds of pasty-faced, dull-eyed locals, I followed these signs and parked the car. I was completely unprepared for what was around the corner:It looked as if a chunk of Regency London had been picked up and dropped in the middle of Sheerness. Everything around was unremittingly hideous, so how did these buildings come to be here? On closer inspection, it didn't look as if the church would be around for much longer: Apparently, this was once part of a bustling Royal Navy base, built after Sheppey became the only part of mainland Britain to have been invaded since 1066.In 1667, a fleet of Dutch warships arrived at Sheerness and met with some very half-hearted resistance from the ill-fed, underpaid local garrison. Sheppey was only occupied for three days - I don't think the Dutch could stand being there any longer - but it was enough to convince Samuel Pepys to establish a Royal Naval dockyard in the town.The church in the photo was built during the Regency period. This is what it looked like a century ago:Sadly, when the Royal Navy abandoned Sheerness in 1960, over 5o historic buildings were quietly destroyed, including these:I tried to take a photo of the hideous container port that has replaced the dockyard, but within seconds a security guard walked up to me and told me that I couldn't take any pictures, as it was a high security area. He made it quite clear that the matter was non-negotiable. I nodded and started to walk away.I don't like being told what to do, particularly by private security guards, so I developed an ingenious plan: I'd pretend to walk away, hide around the corner, pop out from behind a tree and take a shot. They'd never rumble that.I found my tree, disabled the flash and quickly took a photo. It wasn't quick enough. A loud \"Oi!\" was followed by the sound of someone running. My car was just around the corner and I started to speed up my pace, whilst trying to create the impression that I wasn't really running away and always walked like Quentin Crisp.I had visions of being pursued across the island, all for the sake of one stupid, dull photo of a freight terminal. There was only one bridge to the mainland and I didn't know the roads. The situation was hopeless. I slowed down and waited for the guard to arrive.It was a different man; younger and more amenable. He soon accepted that I wasn't a potential terrorist, but seemed to think that I was a container port enthusiast, which was far worse. I tried to explain why I was there, but I wasn't quite sure myself. One thing was clear: I wanted to leave and was grateful that the guard gave me the opportunity to delete the picture without taking things any further.I decided to head back to the mainland and felt a palpable sense of relief when I left Sheppey behind me. I don't think I'll ever go back.At this point I could have happily driven home, but there were still a few hours of daylight left. I decided to follow the next road sign I saw. It said FavershamI knew nothing about Faversham. It was a name that nestled somewhere in my subconscious, next to Miss Havisham and evoked an olde worlde, genteel town full of Daily Telegraph readers. Amazingly, that's exactly what it was: These attractive almshouses are probably home to several Miss Havishams, although the real Miss Havisham would probably be more at home in the building across the road:I liked Faversham straight away. The best towns have an ecclectic mixture of buildings from different periods and because they have developed organically over time, they work far better than planned communities. The other important ingredient in a sucessful town is a social mix and although Faversham appeared solidly middle class, I felt that it still was a working town with a broad cross-section of people:However, this was probably the nearest the Faversham got to having any mean streets. The rest of the town centre was more like this:Kent is a strange place. Parts of it conform to its \"Garden of England\" image, with historic towns, beautiful villages and a countryside dotted with oasthouses, but there are also other areas that are blighted by bad housing, overdevelopment and poor transport links.I'm particularly interested in the darker side of Kent. Canterbury and Whitstable may have their charms but I'm attracted to the forgotten places that are barely acknowledged in guide books and tourist brochures, like this tower that I discovered last year.The journey home seemed to take forever and when I finally passed the sign that marked the beginning of East Sussex, I felt that this was my home. Sod the ancestors."},
{"title": "Twelve Years Ago", "date": "Tuesday, March 02, 2010", "text": "Twelve years ago I had an incredibly vivid dream about being in Chile. It was sunset. The sky was a deep orange and I was walking along a quiet road that was littered with purple blossom. Unlike most dreams, which are usually a montage of random nonsense, this one was quite explicit: go to Chile.As a hardcore rationalist, I dismissed the dream's message. I had no connection with Chile and had never visited South America, so why was this dream so compelling? Was it anything to do with the fact that it was February and I was working in Slough? More than likely.Three days later, in a moment of madness, I picked up my credit card and booked a flight to Santiago.Three weeks later - exactly twelve years ago - I was in Puerto Montt in the south of Chile, wondering what I was doing there. I had travelled to Chile in search of warmth and sunshine, but had travelled so far south that the climate was beginning to feel very British.Even the landscape looked familiar. Frisian cows grazed in lush green fields bordered by blackberry bushes. Blue skies were dotted with white, puffy cumulonimbus clouds. It could almost have been Devon, apart from the snow-capped, smoking volcano in the distance.When I arrived at Puerto Montt, the sky was grey and the sea a familiar dull turquoise. It was like Bognor Regis.I found a cheap room, with a window that turned out to be directly above the outflow vent of a restaurant kitchen. Soon, everything I wore stank of cooking oil, but that was the least of my worries. Earlier that day I had decided to visit the loo on my coach and as I shut the door behind me, the wheels went over a cattle grid and the urine of several dozen passengers splashed up onto my jacket.I decided that my sartorial demise ruled out restaurants, so I decided to wander around the town in search of a decent cafe.Puerto Montt was an intriguing mixture of slightly rundown buildings with corrugated tin roofs and a modern shopping mall that looked as if it has been stolen from Fresno. Outside the smart chain stores, hawkers lined the streets selling socks, felt tip pens and used plastic bags. Most of the people were either Indian or mixed race, but all of the adverts featured European faces.As I walked towards the seafront, I saw a circus:It was a sorry sight. There were no acrobats or clowns around, but several ill-fed, badly-treated animals. In the picture below, a group of people were deriving great pleasure from watching a monkey that was tethered to a chain, trying to free itself. As you can see, it was too much excitement for the man lying on the ground:But the saddest sight of all was this:My camera, which was one of my most ill-advised purchases (remember the so-called Advanced Photographic System?), fails to capture the dull, mangy coat of the lion. The cage was so small that the lion was barely able to turn.I was glad that I was staying in Puerto Montt for just the one night. Even so, it still beat Slough. The next day, I boarded a ferry and travelled to the island of Chiloe.Chiloe was one of the wettest places I've ever visited.  Luckily the oil from the kitchen vent had waterproofed my clothes. I smelt awful, but at least I was dry.When the sun came out, Chiloe was stunning. The palafitos in Castro, the island's capital, are now a UN World Heritage site (I think, or I could be making that up).I had planned to arrive in Castro on 3rd March - my birthday - and spend the evening celebrating in the best restaurant I could find. Sadly, five minutes after leaving the hotel I was caught in a downpour and, rather than let my desert boots get completely soaked, dashed into a nearby restaurant.The moment I entered I knew I had made a mistake. It wasn't just the smell of rot and vomit, but also the lack of customers that was offputting. I decided to try and keep an open mind, but the food was gaggingly, gut-wrenchingly awful. As for the wine, I can only assume that there was a bet on in the kitchen to see whether the Englishman in the corner would drink a glass of genuine piss.It was a very weird birthday, but memorable.The next day the rain was so bad that I couldn't go out. I turned on the only English television channel to find Kevin Costner's Waterworld. Those are the darker moments of travel: rain, bad food and a Kevin Costner movie. Luckily I had a copy of Bleak House with me.Obviously this post has been inspired by the news coverage of Saturday's earthquake. In spite of some rather odd experiences, I quickly fell in love with Chile. It is a magical place. I no longer dream about Chile in my sleep, but when it is February and the sky is permanently grey and the air is cold and damp, I know that there is somewhere in the world where I can feel the sun on my skin and pick blackberries."},

After writing about Diana Dors a few days ago, I was excited to discover this kiss and tell memoir:\"I've been a naughty girl!\" declares Dors, giving a little frisson of excitement to vicars, bank managers and headmasters all over the country. The title's great too - if you like tabloid-style puns (and I do). Unfortunately, this book hasn't joined \"Testament of Youth\" in the pantheon of great biographies that never go out of print.Next, a poem that I found on a folded-up piece of paper inside a book:I love you Tim with all my heart I know this full wellIn poetry they say thou art and the rest can go to ****!Lets cut yab (?) and say to you that I wish you liked me toAlso lets say that you are fab and better than doctor whoI love you true and I hope that you realize itIf you don't like it and really despize itI shall get my brother on to you and you                                           will regretize it.To think that I almost threw the piece of paper away, unaware of its hidden treasure. I don't know when it was written, but \"fab\" had become passé by the mid-1970s.I wonder if the author \"regretized\" writing this poem?On a slightly more exalted note, another book yielded this leaflet, with a beautiful woodcut by Robert Gibbings:I'd never heard of Robert Gibbings, but apparently he was an Irish artist who was a colleague of Eric Gill. I've looked Gibbings up on Google images and there are some stunning engravings and prints.On the subject of illustration, every since I wrote about Victorian colour printing technology, I have discovered around a dozen nineteenth century books with plates that seem far ahead of their time. This is the frontispiece to an 1874 copy of \"The Heir of Redclyffe\":The bold, vibrant colours are very impressive and haven't deteriorated with age, unlike this photo:The fashion suggests 1971-73 - maxi dresses with puffy sleeves were a relatively short-lived fashion. I love the contrast between the glamour of the dress and the bland, suburban setting: the television ariel cable disappearing into the window with nylon net curtains, the patchy lawn and half-broken fence.It reminds me of some photos a friend used to receive from his penfriend - a girl in Nottingham.She liked to design and make her own clothes and would create costumes that made Steve Strange look like Man at C&A. Once the outfits were complete, she'd put them on and have her photograph taken. When I saw the pictures, I always used to notice the contrast between the glamour of the clothes and the drab setting: the front room of a council house, with a gas fire in the background, a faded Hay Wain on the wall and a complete absence of books.I wonder if there were any bookless houses in the Socialist paradise of the Soviet Union?My Cyrillic's a little rusty, but this picture clearly says that all's well in the Motherland: the wheat quotas have been met, the five year plan is on track and Utopia is just around the corner.In fact, this is just a school textbook for young children, with lots of pictures like these:I couldn't find any illustrations of gulags, enemies of the people and bread queues, but many other aspects of Russian life are represented in this book and apart from a few pictures, it's as if the Revolution never happened.How do I get from Russia to the King of Greece? I'll take the Orthodox route. The next item is the front of an envelope I found in a book:It isn't every day that you find correspondence to the king of Greece.  The letter is from a Mormon, warning the King about World War III and World War IV. I have no idea why the Mormon felt that it was so important to warn the king of Greece, but he made a bad choice, as Constantine was deposed in a coup a year or two later.I can't think of a link from the King of Greece to this photo, although the baby does have a regal bearing. His name is Maxwell Craig Barton, born just over 90 years ago on February 6th 1920. It's possible that he is still alive.Finally, glasses. I think that some women can look incredibly sexy in glasses, but I'm not sure if this is one of those occasions:Thicker frames might have done the trick and perhaps an outfit that was less Little Bo-Peep, but fashions change and today's Diana Dors is tomorrow's Katie Price."},

It is an intimidating place, but I have to go there, as that's where the books are kept.\r\rSometimes I wait until after sunset, when the cacophony of noise is replaced by an eerie silence and I can enjoy hunting for first editions without risking being crushed under the wheels of a forklift truck. But most of the time, I have to enter the warehouse during working hours, negotiating my way around huge stacks of boxes as if I am part of a giant Tetris game.\r\rOnce I've found what I'm looking for, I climb the metal staircase that takes me back to warmth, sunlight and silence. I feel grateful and guilty.The warehouse is another world. It is cold, dirty and uncomfortable, with a noise level that seems to reduce ordinary conversation to a series of shouted expletives. The staff are a mixed bunch, but most are young lads who have barely started shaving, but still seem to have at least one child.\rEveryone smokes.\rTwo weeks ago I was given the go-ahead to expand my department and recruit two extra members of staff. I already have three brilliant graduates who barely required any training, so I decided to advertise externally for two more. Unfortunately, the word got out in the warehouse and I have received several internal applications.I know why people are applying. They see my department as a \"cushy number\" and I suppose it is. We have chairs, windows and heating, which are something of a luxury in my workplace.\rUnfortunately I don't think anyone actually knows what we do. The nearest someone came to the truth was describing our work as \"data entry\" (which was an improvement on the person who asked me what fiction was), but it still fell short of the mark. It's a very awkward situation. I don't think I'm being that fussy, but I would like someone who can spell, knows that George Eliot was a woman and doesn't keep asking me to translate Roman numerals for them. But regretably there aren't many people in my building who tick any of those boxes.\rIt's strange, because most of the people I work with seem bright, funny interesting people who could be perfectly capable of doing a fairly straightforward job like valuing and writing about antiquarian books. Why are they leaving school without the skills needed to do this?Sadly a lot of the external applications haven't been any better. Take this extract from a covering letter I received recently:\r\"i am currently avalible for immidiate start and have a good knollage of authors and different type of books which i think  would be good to bring to the team and be a big help with the job.\"\rGiven that the job description asked for a high standard of written English, this sentence was quite breathtaking. I was tempted to write back, advising the candidate (in the kindest way possible) to at least use the spellcheck facility.Most of the other candidates weren't much better. Is this the legacy of Tony Blair's \"Education, education, education\" policy, with its \"literacy hours\" and SATS tests? Who, or what is to blame?"},
{"title": "Farewell Lionel Jeffries", "date": "Friday, February 19, 2010", "text": "The death of Lionel Jeffries has come as something as a shock - mainly because I had no idea that he was still alive.The second surprise is that Jeffries was 83 when he died, which means that when he played the eccentric grandfather (pictured above) in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, he was only 42 - a year younger than his on-screen son, Dick van Dyke.Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is a marvellous film and Jeffries was wonderful in it, but his lasting legacy must be two of the most perfect children's films ever made: The Railway Children and The Amazing Mr Blunden, which Jeffries adapted and directed.The Railway Children is full of delights, from Bernard Cribbins' performance as Albert Perks, to Jenny Agutter's decision to remove her bloomers to prevent a train crash, but the highlight has to be the end of the film. I defy anyone to watch this The Railway Children without shedding a  quiet tear.However, my favourite has to be the hugely-underrated The Amazing Mr Blunden, which was filmed in 1971. The film's strength lies in the story, which is part ghost story, part murder mystery (with the obligatory children who have been plunged into genteel poverty following their father's demise). It has everything a child could want (apart from guns and talking animals).But it's not just the story that makes The Amazing Mr Blunden so memorable. It's also the wonderful casting.Before she became the rather odd Mrs Peter Sellers, Lynne Frederick was a fine actress and really carries the film. Laurence Naismith is also wonderful as the enigmatic Mr Blunden - the grandfather we'd all love to have. But the star has to be Miss Diana Dors:Although Dors was once hailed as the English Marilyn Monroe, she relished her role as the hideous, evil old hag Mrs Wickens and really steals the show. She is the pantomime villain par excellence. Sadly, there doesn't appear to be a clip of Diana Dors as Mrs Wickens on YouTube, but here is a nice one that sets the scene:With two such excellent films under his belt, you would have expected Jeffries' career to go from strength to strength, but instead it petered out. I have no idea why, but perhaps the obituaries will reveal the answer."},
{"title": "Under the Volcano", "date": "Wednesday, February 17, 2010", "text": "In the age of the internet, it is easy to become blasé about images that would have once created a stir, but there are some photographs that still induce a powerful, visceral reaction. This is one of the most stunning pictures I have ever seen:It's not just the proximity of the photographer to the lava flow, or even the great technical accomplishment of capturing both the fiery glow of the magma and the faint stars in the early morning sky that makes this image a masterpiece. It's the contrast between the extremes of beauty and terror.I've been obsessed with volcanic islands for years and four years ago, I decided to go to Iceland. Apart from one near-death experience, I had a really good time and saw some wonderful things.If you ever want to get away from it all, Iceland is the place to go. It has the one of the lowest population densities in the world and it's possible to walk for hours without meeting anyone. Iceland also has the lowest biodiversity rate of any country and the defining features of the landscape are rock, water and sky:Such an austere landscape may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I loved it. You can drink from the rivers in Iceland (and it is the best water you'll ever taste, I promise) and the purity of the air has provided relief for many asthma sufferers.But what I also love about Iceland is that in spite of its benign exterior, the island is sitting on a geological powder keg. Steams pours out of fissures in the ground, pools bubble like cauldrons and occasionally, there are violent volcanic eruptions, some of which have resulted in hundreds of deaths.At school, we are told that beneath the Earth's crust, there is a magma of molten lava. In Iceland you can almost feel it through the soles of your shoes."},

I particularly like the large black \"Sorting Hat\" belonging to the woman on the right:Next, things take a more sinister turn. What initially appears to be a rather bad modern poem, turns out to be part of some notes written by somebody who is spying on a couple:I wonder what became of Chrissy and Marcus?The next four photos are something of a mystery. Taken between 1903 and 1905, they are part of an album devoted to a place mysteriously known as \"the Home\". We are never told where the home is or what it's for.The album contains a few clues, but they haven't yielded any results on Google. I'm not surprised. I spent a year in a children's home when I was ten - it was a life-changing experience - but until recently, my internet searches drew a blank. It's shocking to think that even places and institutions within living memory can disappear so easily.Finally, some further examples of Victorian colour printing:I've been told that my deliveries are going to increase during the next few weeks, so I shall be keeping an eye out for more enigmatic photographs and menacing messages."},

Within the last few weeks, I've found several Victorian books with stunning colour plates. My most recent discovery is an 1871 title called Aunt Friendly's Book of Gifts.The illustrations are remarkably vivid, but the book's main surprise is it's depiction of popular nursery rhyme characters:In this picture, Humpty Dumpty isn't a large egg with limbs, but an ordinary boy (if wearing a red fez and green jerkin counts as ordinary). On another page, there is a conventional illustration for See-Saw, Margery Daw, but instead of Johnny, it is Janey who shall have a new master.And in this plate, Little Bo-Peep is a boy. The remaining illustrations are quite conventional, but it is so unusual to see engravings from this time with colour:The cliffs remind me of Sussex, but why is the young man carrying a crossbow?I've found even earlier titles with good quality colour plates, which makes me wonder why it took roughly a century before colour illustrations became the norm rather than the exception."},
{"title": "The Death of Steerforth", "date": "Tuesday, February 09, 2010", "text": "Actually I think it's probably just a virus, but being a man I feel duty bound to lie in bed and suffer from intimations of mortality. If I can't get in the mood, there's always some Shostakovich on my MP3 player. I defy anyone to listen to Six Poems of Marina Tsvetayeva without succumbing to the urge to throw themselves under the nearest bus replacement service. However, when I was 17 I couldn't get enough of it.I miss the emotional highs of being a teenager - the delusion that you are the hero of your own novel, embarking on a great adventure. I didn't relish discovering that in reality, I was a minor character in a badly-written blockbuster. However, I don't miss the terrible angst and black depressions that seemed to appear from nowhere.I agree with Shaw that youth is wasted on the young. Looking back, my teens could have been one long snogfest if I hadn't been so idiotic. For example, when a girl asked me if I was interested in going to Paris for a weekend, I concluded that she might fancy me, but there wasn't enough evidence to reach a firm conclusion. How stupid can you get?Instead, I spent far too much time listening to Mahler and watching obscure European films (although I'll admit that the latter was partly for the gratuitous nudity).In spite of this, I would give anything to recapture a feeling I had when I was 19, walking along a moonlit beach in Dorset. I have been to many far more remarkable places since then, but my responses are always tempered by a terrible self-consciouness: here I am on the edge of the Grand Canyon and I can see that it is awe-inspiring, but am I feeling what I should be feeling? In Dorset, I experienced a perfect moment; perhaps because I was surprised by joy (and top marks if you spotted the references to both C.S.Lewis and a Martine McCutcheon single).I'm still have those wonderful serendipitous moments, but the moment I become aware, the bubble bursts. It's very annoying.If you're wondering what the point to this post is, I'm afraid that there isn't one. These are the demented ramblings of someone in the advanced stages of Man Flu, with his whole life flashing before him. I do apologise."},

{"title": "Diaries of a Nobody", "date": "Wednesday, February 03, 2010", "text": "\"I have no heart for camping. I would rather be amongst my books in some cottage.\"Most of the books I deal with at work are titles that have failed to sell in charity shops. That might not sound very promising, but my employers have built up a successful, multi-million pound business selling books that used to be dumped on landfill sites.Occasionally we also receive the contents of house clearances, where the owner of the books has either died or moved into an old people's home. It can be rather depressing wading through someone's book collection, realising that however erudite and well-read they were, this is how it ends.On Monday we received a huge delivery of house clearance stock, most of which had a religious theme. The books were mostly conventional titles about Biblical history and the Gospels, but there were a few that were more off the wall. I noticed a recurring theme of lost civilsations and in addition to the usual titles about Atlantis, there was one book that tried to prove that humans and dinosaurs co-existed. Who owned this strange collection?The answer lay in a box at the bottom, which contained the personal diaries of a local government officer called Derek.Why were Derek's journals sent to us? A few of his diaries from the 1950s could have been mistaken for books, but not the thick, foolscap binders from the 1980s, with their typewritten pages.These diaries were of no use to us and were almost binned, but I couldn't bring myself to throw someone's life into a skip. I rescued the box and later, started to browse its contents.This is Derek in 1956:If he looks like this in the mid-1950s, then we can assume that Derek was born at some point between 1925 and 1935.When Derek's diaries begin, he is in love with Brenda:Derek marries Brenda and they have a son. They also become Mormons, and the recurring theme in the diaries is Derek's personal battle against sin and temptation. This extract is from 1987:\"I was much troubled by evil dreams last night. I tossed and turned upon my bed in a way I have not done for many years. I dreamt that I was at the office and kept calling the female staff by titles and names that were blatantly sexist and in transgression of the County Council's instructions in this matter.\"The Pooterish tone of the writing results in many examples of unintentional hilarity:\"On the way to Bristol this morning, Elaine Hamilton and I got to discussing her daughter's hay fever and I suggested that susceptibility to such things could be dependent upon the density of the hairs in one's nose. It was a novel suggestion that gave her some thought!\"Or:\"Eric the Barber, with his lady assistant, was sitting in his shop idle when I passed by with the hamster. He called out to me, so I went in and showed the scrap to them. Eric thought that hamsters would live amicably together in the same cage. I soon disillutioned him of that myth. I also told him that they were a great thing to have in the house if one were plagued by mice, since mice are scared beyond measure by hamsters.\"Hamsters obviously play an important role in Derek's household:\"When we got back home, we said hello to Brenda, Richard and the hamster.\"The Pooterish theme extends to the cast of characters: Mr Sunter and Mr Limpett, Oliver Dewsnapp, Gerald Ramsbottom, Mrs Moncrieff, Norman and Joan Farbass, Warwick Kear, Steve Fagg, Pam Bolloch, Julia Sleat and Malcolm Satchel. All real people.But it would be so easy to save Derek's diaries just so that I could use them as comic material, whereas the truth is that the humorous moments are only a small part of the whole. Derek comes across as a decent man, trying to live the good life according to his beliefs. He is plagued by self-doubt and his journals bear witness to the struggles of an ordinary person who is regularly plagued by extraordinary feelings:\"I set my lip on fire the other morning. And on Sunday night I had a dream. I became acquainted with an attractive woman with curly hair, but undefined facial features. I was much tempted by her and took her back to a basement with rusty radiators...\"And what of the diary itself? Why did Derek faithfully maintain his journal for at least forty years?\"Why I keep a journal is often a mystery to myself. There is an inward compulsion - some would call it egotism - that will not rest until my life is recorded. Of course, the Keeper always imagines that any journal he keeps will be of inestimable value to future generations; will be a work of intimate revelations that will declare his glory to endless decades. And that is a foolish dream hardly worth the paper he has kept it on. \"I don't know what to do with Derek's diaries, however I can't bring myself to throw them away. But if not now, when?"},

It's an ugly, clumsy-looking device that reminds me of the first generation of mobile phones. The Kindle lacks the elegance of the I-Touch and I can't see it winning any design awards:Bezos adds that \"Kindle readers read a lot\", but what does that mean? I listen to a lot of music on my MP3 player, but I would argue that the quailty of my listening has deteriorated, as the technology allows me to jump tracks so easily.It feels like a long time ago (it is a time long ago) since the days when I'd carefully remove an LP from its sleeve, put it on the turntable, gently lift the stylus arm and place it down on the outer edge of the record, listening with anticipation to the crackles and clicks. Whether I was playing a Shostakovich symphony or a Stevie Wonder album, I would lie back and listen to the whole thing, experiencing the record as a whole.I'm ashamed to say that I can't remember the last time I listened to a piece of music in its entirety. I can partly blame my children - we live in a small house and I don't have a \"room of one's own\". However, there is nothing to stop me lying down on the bed and listening to a piece of music on my headphones.When I do listen to anything on my MP3 player, I find that I have the attention-span of a two-year-old. I will dutifully begin listening to Beethoven's Eroica symphony, right up to that sublime moment when Beethoven gets really angry, then my attention will wander and I'll start zipping through my tracklist: St John Passion, Andy Warhol, Siegfried Idyll, Meera Nam Chin Chin Chu, Luonnotar, The Headmaster Ritual, Concerto for Orchestra, Wichita Lineman, Trying Not to Think About the Time, Peter Grimes...30 seconds here, 15 seconds there, I know I've only myself to blame, but it's too easy to change tracks. I need a deterent - the modern-day equivalent of the tedious, time-wasting process of rewinding a C-120 cassette back to the beginning.If I had a Kindle with several dozen books at my fingertips, I'd probably go through a similar process, giving up on anything that wasn't utterly gripping. My Kindle would have to be restricted to one book at a time.I'm not a Luddite, but I'm concerned about the increasing emphasis on quantity rather than the quality of experience. Our Kindles can store hundreds of books whilst our MP3 players and cameras can store thousands of tracks and photos, but what is the end result? Are we leading richer lives as a result?I can see certain situations where the Kindle comes into its own. If you're backpacking for several months or are one of those commuters who devour airport novels, the Kindle is ideal. But, to quote the title of a novel, books do furnish a room. The book isn't just a medium, but the thing in itself. It is something that we see, touch, smell and even hear, as we flick through the pages.Working with secondhand books, I am acutely aware of the sensorial qualities of a book: the slightly indecent softness of calf leather, the odour of stale pipe tobacco, the cracking of the binding as you open an old book, the unpleasant, chalky feeling of photographic plates, the smell of public libraries and, occasionally, damp, mildewy cellars.These qualities proved to be too much for one of my customers who, last week, returned a 1920s book to me with a handwritten letter explaining that she felt that the book was too dirty to take to bed. There was nothing wrong with the book. Perhaps my customer would be happier with a nice, germ-free Kindle?I shall not be buying an e-reader or I-Pad. I don't need more technology. What I do need is something that I got rid of years ago and have been quietly regretting it ever since: a wind-up gramophone.Twelve years ago, when I lived in Twickenham, there was a power-cut late in the evening. Everyone was plunged into silence and darkness. However, my wife and I lit candles, opened a bottle of wine and listened to Noel Coward records on our gramophone. It was one of those perfect moments.No piece of technology I own has ever bought as much pleasure. With their vast array of functions and huge storage, my gadgets promise so much, but somehow they seem to deliver so little."},

{"title": "Seduction", "date": "Tuesday, January 26, 2010", "text": "Last Saturday I caught the train to Victoria to meet some old university friends at the Coal Hole, which I love. It's one of the few central London pubs where you can always get a seat, thanks to a secret basement.After a few drinks we walked along the Strand to the India Club - one of the most bizarre restaurants I've ever visited. There are no neon signs or menus in the window. The entrance is in an inconspicuous doorway, with only a small plaque to alert passers-by to the restaurant's existence.After ascending three flights of stairs, you enter a room that looks like the refectory of an Antarctic research station or a nuclear bunker, with cheap formica tables and garish flourescent strip lights. I kept expecting people to enter through an airlock.The waiters always seem surprised by anyone's arrival. On one visit I discovered them all fast asleep, lying on rows of chairs pulled together (I crept out and returned later). They are also flummoxed by standard restaurant practices, like putting plates on the table. Instead of moving glasses and side dishes to make room, the waiters stare impassively at the table, as if contemplating an algebraic equation.The restaurant isn't licensed, but if you ask for beer a Polish girl will mysteriously appear five minutes later with a bottle of Eastern European beer and a request for hard cash. It is all very strange. But then the food arrives and apart from being very reasonably priced, it is gorgeous - better than anything most Indian restaurants serve.During the evening, one friend confessed that when he was doing a postgrad course, he'd made a compilation cassette called \"Seduction Tape.\" The idea was simple enough: he'd entice girls back to his room, turn the heating up to maximum and put the tape on.He then revealed the track listing. This was the fourth track:Not a great seduction song, to put it mildly. Sailor only had two hits and were generally regarded as the poor man's Roxy Music.  By the time this song appeared on my friend's compilation tape, Sailor were a distant memory from another decade. Surely this seduction technique couldn't have worked?However, my friend had the last word: \"Reader, I married her.\""},

I will be accompanied by two young boys, my wife and her mother, all of whom have very different requirements.I decided to start with Brittany, which I typed into Google Images. Unfortunately I didn't realise that Brittany is a popular porn star name in America, so I ended up with a very different sort of trip.Filtering out the \"adult\" material helped, but I was still left with hundreds of websites, none of which answered my main question: where can I guarantee my children a magical holiday without being utterly miserable?And this is where I turn to my fellow bloggers.

Here is a short selection of her opinions, written to instruct the young ladies of the British Empire:INDIAThe people are a mixed race of many nations, very clever and ingenious, and generally gentle and kindly; but, like all heathen people, occasionally very cruel.SUDANThe people are black in complexion, rude and uncivilised.GREECEThe people are clever, lively, and cunning - inclined to brigandage, or robbing in bands - but the upper classes make good merchants.AUSTRALIAThe native Australians have nearly died out; they were a very inferior race of savages.LAPLANDThe Lapps are a dwarfish, Mongolian race, seldom exceeding four feet in height.

The women are renowned for their morality.SPAINThe people are brave, but rather ferocious; proud and jealous.RUSSIAThe people are gentle and submissive, but untruthful and cruel.WEST AFRICAThe people are savages, with no religion, but a superstition of fetishes, or charms.ETHIOPIAIt is inhabited by a barbarous people who are always engaged in petty civil wars.As far as northern Europe and the \"colonies\" are concerned, Mrs Valentine has nothing but good to say, praising the natives for their industriousness and honesty. However, she is very quiet on the subject of the United States, perhaps because they had the impudence to desert the Crown.We can laugh now, but it's terrifying that Mrs Valentine's views were once considered quite normal."},
{"title": "The Perils of Novel Reading", "date": "Saturday, January 23, 2010", "text": "Yesterday I found a wonderful Victorian self-help guide called \"The Young Woman's Book\". Compiled and edited by Mrs Valentine, a well-known children's author in her day, the book contains advice and instruction on an astonishing variety of subjects, from employing domestic servants to choosing a pet bird.Books of this kind are always amusing, but The Young Woman's Book puts its rivals into the shade, expressing opinions that make the Taliban look like a bunch of hippies. I'll be posting several extracts during the following week and will begin with one of the more moderate chapters:READING\"To sit over a foolish or even a wise novel when the daily duties of life demand our attention is absolutely wicked. We have seen, in our own life, the mother of a family devote herself to novel reading.The father was at sea in the merchant service. A boy, a girl, and the house demanded the wife's attention. The children were neglected, dirty, ragged, untaught, running about the roads; the house was dirty beyound description, for there was but one servant, who naturally, followed her mistress's example.The wife could not make her income suffice her, because no one watched against waste or dishonesty in the kitchen, and her husband, when he came home from sea, was arrested for her debts.The son, utterly ruined, ran away from school, and finally disappeared in Australia. The daughter, trained only in the unreal folly of novels, married secretly a man much below her father's station - he was also an hereditary madman!When the mother of the boy and girl married, she had been a lovely, clever girl. But novel reading, like intoxication, bought misery on her and on two following generations.\"Wise words. I hope that you will heed the advice of Mrs Valentine, throw away your novels and attend to domestic duties, before it is too late."},
{"title": "A Touch of Class", "date": "Tuesday, January 19, 2010", "text": "\"It is impossible for an Englishman to open his mouth without making some other Englishman hate or despise him.\" - George Bernard ShawIn a recent post about Waterstone's, I made a casual remark about the former managing director and his Estuary accent, unwittingly implying that he was a \"bit common\" to be leading Britain's largest bookshop chain.John Self was quick to spot my woolly thinking (it's his job) and asked me exactly what I meant. I began to write what I thought was a coherent, reasonable explanation, but soon realised that I had begun to dig a hole. I deleted my reply and wrote another considered, reasonable response. The hole grew even bigger.I knew that I was on the wrong track when my wife (who rarely reads this blog), spotted the exchange and said \"I don't know what you're on about, but I agree with John Self\".At this point I started to question myself. Why did I have such a negative attitude towards a particular regional accent? I toyed with the idea of constructing an argument based on the aesthetic qualities of Estuary - but I knew that it would be avoiding the issue.The unpalatable truth is that I harbour a prejudice - one that has its origins in early childhood.My parents were both working class, but aspired to move up the social ladder and focused their aspirations on me. As a young child I wasn't allowed to play with the \"rough boys\" and whenever we walked past Teddington Social Club, my mother would point to the women inside playing Bingo and tell me how \"common\" they were.At first I spoke with a Laahndun accent, but was constantly upbraided for saying \"Sa-urday\" and \"Man Uni-ed\" until I developed what my mother still refers to as a \"nice speaking voice\" (\"Joan says you could read the news.\"). The accent was a mixed blessing. I didn't know any middle-class people and my peers mocked me for being posh.It would be unfair to imply that my parents brutally crushed any signs of a working-class identity. I was a willing participant. From an early age I made it clear that I prefered Earl Grey  and Camembert to PG Tips and Cheddar. Indeed, my nickname in those days was \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\".By my teens, I started to mix with middle-class kids and was amazed to find houses full of books and original paintings. It was a revelation. At one friend's house, the room where we played snooker contained the complete Thames and Hudson World of Art series and, much to my friend's annoyance, I was more concerned with discovering what Fauvism and Cubism were.Suddenly everything - the BBC accent, my interest in the arts and penchant for foreign cheeses - clicked into place. I was middle class. My parents' experiment has succeeded, almost.So where does the Estuary accent comment come into all of this?It's complicated, but I think that my parents' obsession with making me speak \"properly\" left me with a deep-rooted prejudice about the local accent. During my teens I successfully rejected my parents views on race, gender and politics and came to regard myself as a liberal (with a small \"l\").Little did I realise that beneath my enlightened exterior, there lurked a bigot!In the past, there was no such thing as received pronunciation. We know this, because before spelling was standardised, people wrote phonetically. Then, in the Victorian age, accents began to be linked to social background and that's where all the trouble began.John Self mischievously asked where he stood with his Belfast accent. Could he be bookish? All I can say is that my irrational prejudice doesn't extend to other regions. I reserve my wrath purely for my neighbours. Indeed, I actively like accents from other regions and countries, as they all seem much pleasanter than Estuary (with the possible exception of the South African accent).It's all very silly. Does any of this matter? No, of course it doesn't, and now that I'm aware of my prejudice I will work hard to expunge it from my psyche. I'll no longer wince when someone says \"toe\" for \"two\" or drops the \"g\" from the \"ing\" words.Accents are changing all the time. BBC English is a relatively modern construct, rather than the heir of some apostolic succession from a golden age and even the BBC rarely employ it these days.I am already an anachronism."},

{"title": "All Change at Waterstone's", "date": "Thursday, January 14, 2010", "text": "Although it's too early to put out any flags, I was delighted to read that the managing director of Waterstone's Booksellers has left the company immediately, following a disastrous Christmas that saw sales decline by 8.5%.This is good news, because it will hopefully deal a severe blow to those people who think that bookselling is like any other branch of retail. Their experiment has failed.Gerry Johnson joined Waterstone's as Managing Director in 2006, shortly before the company bought the Ottakar's chain of bookshops. The business had been going through a difficult time for a number of years and morale was fairly low, so when Johnson claimed that he wanted to create a new Waterstone's that combined the passion of Ottakar's with the efficiecy of Waterstone's, many booksellers and publishers had high hopes.I worked for Ottakar's and felt quite pessimistic about my new employer but my boss insured me that I had nothing to worry about. \"They've changed. It's all hearts and minds now.\"Lacking any Plan B, I decided to stay and see whether the New Waterstone's would be as bogus and disappointing as New Labour. I soon received my answer.Gerry Johnson seemed an unlikely choice for managing director of Britain's largest bookshop chain. With his high-pitched estuary accent and solid retail background, Johnson wasn't particularly bookish. On one occasion he unwittingly revealed that he'd never heard of \"On the Road\". However, Johnson was clearly a very astute and intelligent man, who seemed to have some good ideas for Waterstone's. So what went wrong?As an insider, I felt that there were too many people in senior positions who didn't understand the book trade. I sensed an inverted snobbery on the part of these retailers and their attitude towards the store managers - many of whom were brighter and better educated - was defensive. The mangement were obsessed with systems, efficiencies and procedures, rather than focussing on the nebulous, but all important qualities that make bookshops magical places for both staff and customers.Johnson's tenure should have seen a renaissance at Waterstone's, but instead we now have a business with rock-bottom morale and shops that are as dull as ditchwater.The management problems at Waterstone's are symptomatic of a shift in the culture of many organisations during the last two decades, a change that has seen specialists replaced by generalists. In her recent book \"Socrates in the Boardroom\", Amanda H Goodall convincingly argues that academics make far better leaders of universities than managers. Not a controversial opinion, you'd think, and yet so many organisations reject the expertise of their staff in favour of outsiders.The new managing director, Dominic Myers, is an HMV insider (HMV own Waterstone's). That shouldn't bode well for the future, but having met Myers I feel quietly hopeful, as he came across as a personable, highly intelligent man who actually gets bookselling. It will certainly be good to have Waterstone's managed by an English graduate instead of someone who confuses Jack Kerouac with Cormac McCarthy.But even if Myers has the wisdom to radically change Waterstone's, will it make a difference or is the migration from high street retailers to Amazon and the supermarkets irreversible?"},

It was like 28 Days Later meets The Day of the Triffids.\r\rAfter making the long, painful journey between thinking about getting up and actually doing it, I discovered that the world outside was covered in thick snow. There were no tyre tracks and when I looked at my car, half-buried at the bottom of a hill, it was clear that I wouldn't be going to work.\r\rI was snowbound for five days. This could have been a good thing, but unfortunately my sons' school was cancelled and I ended up with an extended \"Director's cut\" version of the Christmas holidays, with extra scenes of temper tantrums and complaints of being bored. Also, the heating packed up.\r\rThis satellite photograph shows that last week's snow affected almost everywhere in the United Kingdom:\r\r\rIt's serious stuff - the worst winter for nearly 50 years, apparently.

Working with the public is like Russian Roulette - 95% of the people may be fine, but you never know when the bullet's coming. Internet bookselling is a welcome change from bricks and mortar.\r\rThe one downside of internet retail is that some people feel free to send pompous, belligerent and occasionally downright rude emails, knowing it's unlikely that I'll ever have the opportunity to give them the punch in the face that they so clearly deserve. A simple typo prompted someone to send an email beginning \"You idiots...\" (I replied in a \"forthright\" manner and received a rather shamefaced response from someone who claimed that his email account had been \"hacked into\").\r\rA few days later, a duplicate order problem prompted someone in New Zealand to send a long, bitter diatribe complaining that booksellers in Britain probably couldn't be bothered to post orders to the other side of the world. A chippy, pathetic and unwarranted whinge.\r\rWhat a contrast to blogging where, so far, I have seen the best of humanity.

I never normally do things like this. Planning is generally an anathema to me, as other people keeping buggering things up by dying, becoming pregnant, falling in love with someone from another country or simply changing their mind.The one exception to this is foreign travel. If I ever go abroad, I like to memorise maps, learn the local language and refresh my unarmed combat training. It's a jungle out there.Planning the year ahead was a particularly depressing experience. Four weeks holiday. I saw a whole monochrome future laying ahead of me, with only brief, tantalising glimpses of colour to taunt me. Is that living?I was reminded of this banned British Xbox commercial:As adverts go, it's a shocking, visceral masterpiece and it's fascinating how, in an age in which nudity and swearing are no longer taboos on television, the D word is still unacceptable for many.Death is popular on television, but only within specific genres that present it as an aberration that can be resolved once the perpetrator is detected and caught, or defeated in battle. Real death, it seems, is too unpalatable.But death is there, behind everything, looking over my shoulder as I peruse the 2010 year planner, sitting next to me in the car as I drive to work and quietly laughing when I talk about the future.There are so many things that I want to do with my life and I'm not sure if I can stand to devote two-thirds of my life to a full-time job, putting my dreams on hold until retirement.

{"title": "Ten Years On", "date": "Wednesday, December 30, 2009", "text": "I liked the nineties. After all, they began just after the Berlin Wall fell and when Nelson Mandela was released from prison, a few weeks later, it felt as if we were entering a golden age of democracy and general niceness.It just kept getting better. The following year, the Cold War came to an end with the collapse of the Soviet Union and in 1992, a Democrat entered the White House for the first time in 12 years.The 1990s were also a breath of fresh air, culturally. No more \"Greed is good\". The age of hair gel, Lymeswold cheese, shoulder pads, pastels, Phil Collins and Stock Aitken and Waterman made way for hippie chic, organic food and guitar bands. Even if that doesn’t sound so good, at least we saved money on hair products (and those artificial fibres gave people thrush).What is the legacy of the “Noughties”?The answer is extremely depressing: Bush, Blair, Brown (Gordon and Dan), Big Brother, Bin Laden, Baghdad, Beckham, BNP, bankers, Babyshambles, Blackberrys and Britney (for the sake of alliteration, I’ve missed out 9/11, global warming, suicide bombers, Melanie Phillips, Jan Moir, Ann Coulter, John Bolton, Katie Price, Robert Mugabe, Dido, Ahmadinejad, reality television, Kerry Katona, Coldplay, Crocs, Jodie Marsh, Guy Ritchie, Angelina and Brad, Tom and Katie, the Mohammed cartoons, MPs’ expenses, Jeremy Kyle, pandemics, Beagle 2, Sarah Palin, Chris Moyles and obesity).(\"Tweedledum and Tweedledee agreed to have a battle...\")But despite the two gentlemen above, it hasn’t all been bad.Culturally, this decade has produced an embarrassment of riches.I’m not going to attempt to list the highlights, but my own favourites would include The Corrections, Cloud Atlas, the Tate Modern’s Matisse-Picasso exhibition in 2002, the stunning Inuit-language film Atanarjuat, the Fast Runner, Brian Wilson’s Smile tour in 2004, the 2006 Royal Opera House production of Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk District by Shostakovich, Melvyn Bragg’s In Our Time series on Radio Four, Goodbye Lenin, the triumphant return of Doctor Who, Downfall and, perhaps the thing that surprised me most of all, a remake of Battlestar Galactica that was everything its predecessor wasn’t. Honest.However, in spite of the namedropping, I've lived in a cultural wilderness . In the list of the 50 best films of the Noughties, I think I’d watched eight. I missed seven of the top ten art exhibitions, all of the best albums (albums are so last century) and most of the highly acclaimed dramas like The Wire, Sopranos, 24, Six Feet Under etc.I blame it on having young children (Cyril Connolly was right!) and not living in London.On the home front, the last ten years have been rather mixed. I began the decade earning more money than I do now. I was managing a London bookstore with a turnover of £2,000,000 and enjoyed rubbing shoulders with the great and the good of the literary world (actually it wasn't that brilliant, but at least the drinks were free).However, a boy was born and everything changed.I soon found that the \"work-hard-play-hard\" life of London bookselling didn’t dovetail neatly with a baby that screamed all night and a wife who was sliding into postnatal depression from sleep deprivation. In a rash moment, I decided to leave London and take on a less demanding role. Goodbye dear canapes!I paid a high price for my decision: my salary was reduced by 25% and my career ground to a halt for several years (my new shop was the cultural equivalent of Devil's Island).However, leaving London was still one of the most sensible things I've ever done. Moving enabled me to swap a flat in Twickenham for a Victorian house in Lewes and I reduced my daily commute by half, giving me more time to listen to my son screaming.In London I always felt as if life was elsewhere. I no longer had that feeling.On a graph, my career trajectory has followed the same boom and bust pattern as the property prices: gradual ascents with sudden rises, followed by dramatic crashes, tentative recovery and periods of stability. At the moment things seem to be on the up, but I'm acutely aware that they could also change quite quickly. My current bosses are very mercurial.There is an old joke that goes something along the lines of \"If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.\" The last few years have taught me how true this is.This is, after all, an age of uncertainty.

{"title": "Logicomix", "date": "Tuesday, December 22, 2009", "text": "Much to my own surprise, one of the best things I've read recently has been a graphic novel, but that's probably because Logicomix is in a class of its own.Like many graphic novels, the hero is an outsider who has extraordinary mental powers and is obsessed with the fight for justice. However, as heroes go, he is somewhat atypical:You would think that Bertrand Russell's struggle to make the foundations of mathematics logically consistent doesn't lend itself to the graphic novel format. Judge Dredd, yes. Bertrand Russel, no. But Logicomix is a triumph. It takes a broad brush approach to big, complicated ideas and instead of dumbing them down, it manages to gives the reader a clear, concise overview of intellectual developments in Europe during the fin de siecle.That may sound very dull, but what makes Logicomix so interesting is the human story behind Russell's intellectual journey. It is the story of man who, on discovering that his family have been beset by mental illness, seeks sanctuary in the study of logic.I bought Logicomix after reading a rave review in one of the Sunday papers, but had some reservations about the graphic novel format for a book about Bertrand Russell. Fortunately, the authors anticipated their readers' concerns and on page two, they wrote:\"This isn't a typical comic book. In fact, when we started work on it, our friends thought we were crazy! And when they did take us seriously, it was, as a rule, for the wrong reasons, like thinking the book is something it's not! Like, maybe a 'Logic For Dummies' type of thing or perhaps a kind of textbook or a treatise, in the unlikely guise of a graphic novel.\"Logicomix may not be a \"Logic for Dummies\", but it is a \"Bertrand Russell for Dummies\". That isn't a bad thing. In less than two hours of reading, I effortlessly gained an overview of Russell's life, the part he played in Wittgenstein's intellectual develoment and the state of mathematics in the Edwardian era.I can't see myself turning into \"Comic Book Guy\" from The Simpsons, but Logicomix has been a revelation."},

I used to blame it on working in a shop, but I find that I'm still just as prone to feeling an undirected, indiscriminate anger at everything, particularly those houses with Christmas lights in the garden and inflatable Santas.But Christmas has associations and I'm like an abused dog that flinches every time somebody bends down to stroke it. For me, Christmas Eve means queuing for three hours in Argos because my wife has decided that we haven't bought enough presents, followed by a 150-mile round trip to Twickenham to pick up my mother.As much as I love my mother, she turns Christmas Day into an Alan Bennett play, with a steady stream of non sequiturs:\"Aunt Bess used to read the tea leaves. She could see all sorts of things. It's in the family. Then one day she gave up.\"  \"Why? Did she see something bad?\"  \"No, she switched to teabags.\"My wife's family used to know how to enjoy themselves. They would begin drinking champagne at 8.00 in the morning and, apart from a brief lull in the afternoon, the day would be one long party. The Christmas dinner wouldn't appear until 11.00 at night, as everyone was too drunk to organise the cooking any earlier. After the meal there would be indoor fireworks, which usually involved inadvertently setting fire to the Christmas decorations.Coming from a teetotal family, it was a bit of a shock, but great fun.Sadly, most of these people aren't around any more. Indeed, there have been so many deaths that I was beginning to fear a police investigation. With no siblings on either side, Christmases in the Steerforth household have become increasingly quiet.On the subject of police investigations, my wife walked into a door latch last week and we had to go to the local A&E department. It was a ridiculous accident. A friend had sent a text to my wife and her phone was on the floor. As she bent down, the sharp end of a door latch cut her skin.In the hospital, my wife told everyone that she had walked into a door. As she uttered those words, I could see people looking at me, thinking wife beater. \"Can't you be more specific and say that it was the latch?\" I asked, in vain.Two days later, my son went to hospital with a suspected broken finger. It is only a matter of time before I receive a visit from Social Services.To add to the Christmas spirit, our boiler started behaving badly. In Star Trek, they'd call it a \"warp core breach\", but the official plumbing term is \"The pressure's up a bit.\" We have had two plumbers, neither of whom were competent enough to fix the problem, but that didn't stop them from invoicing us for £300! Hell will freeze over before I pay them.Things seemed to be looking up at work, as a new person called Bill joined my team. Bill has had a remarkable life, working on engineering projects in remote jungle areas of South America, along with a six-year stint at the British Embassy in Moscow. Sadly, travel hasn't broadened his mind.Bill is one of those people who vocalises everything that is going on in their head, rather like a woman I sat behind on a coach journey who said \"Supermarket...park...post box...town hall.\" I have spent the last two days oscillating between hating Bill and hating myself for hating Bill, who isn't all that bad really.But as I was thinking all of these grumpy thoughts, I learned that a friend has just experienced one of the worst things that can happen to anyone. Suddenly, my whole persective changed and the prospect of a quiet, uneventful Christmas now seems like a luxury. I won't take it for granted any more."},

It was published in Hungary in 1970 and an English translation didn't appear for another 37 years, but I read it this year and I'm convinced that it will eventually be recognised as one of the great works of European literature.The plot is simple enough: Budai, a linguist, is flying to a conference in Helsinki.

Even worse, although Budai knows a smattering of most of the major European languages, nobody understands a single word he says.Metropole is a masterpiece of alienation, with a dreamlike quality that reminded me of Kazuo Ishiguro's The Unconsoled. However, in Ishiguro's novel, the main character is lauded by the local citizens. In Metropole, Budai feels completely invisible.The lazy option would be to use the term \"Kafkaesque\". Metropole certainly has reasonances of Franz Kafka, but in Ferenc Karinthy's vision there is no malign state apparatus controlling events.  Metrople is the ultimate existentialist nightmare in which the individual finds themsleves completely alone in a meaningless, uncaring universe. Having worked in Slough, I'm very familiar with that feeling.A few years ago, I read Sven Lindqvist's wonderful Desert Divers, which included a chapter on the eccentric Frenchman Pierre Loti. Inspired by Lindvist's account of Loti's exploits in Turkey, I impulsively booked a flight to Istanbul and arranged for a local hotel to pick me up from the airport.It was a perfectly organised short trip, but from the moment I arrived, I was plunged into a situation that had echoes of Metropole. I won't recount the long story here, but I distinctly remember feeling like a ghost, passing unnoticed through crowds of people. This photo sums it up, in which I merely appear as an oddly-shaped shadow:On the penultimate day, I got the worst bout of food poisoning I've ever experienced and collapsed in a street, too weak to even stand. People rushed past, seemingly oblivious to my presence, as if I had become some sort of non-corporeal being. I have never felt more alone.When I read Metropole, I knew exactly how Budai felt. I was that shadow.I haven't read that much this year. Ironically, my new job selling books leaves me very little time to read, but I would recommend two other books, one of which was actually published in 2009. First, W F Herman's Beyond Sleep is a witty, intelligent, playful novel that consistently delights and surprises. Second, M J Hyland's This is How, which should have won the Booker, but was probably too good.This fell out of a book today:A man sits awkwardly on a footstall in front of a hideous sofa, in a room that could be part of a large, static caravan. Is he looking at something or avoiding the eye of the camera?On the surface, this is just a badly-taken portrait with the feet cut off, the subject in the centre and a slightly jaunty angle, but it has echoes of greatness and I'm reminded of the work of Richard Billingham.I'm also struck by the marked contrast with another photo I found, from over a century earlier:However, in this case, I think the main difference is social rather than temporal."},

{"title": "Circle of Friends", "date": "Sunday, December 06, 2009", "text": "Last week I came across one of my best finds yet: a Victorian photograph album from the 1870s, featuring a group of actors and their families. Beneath its tatty exterior, the album is a treasure trove of fascinating photos, many of which are surrounded by beautiful embellishments, hand-painted in watercolour:For many of us, the word Victorian is synonymous with respectability, discipline, temperance and piety. Photographs from the period seem to ratify this view, from the portraits of dour-faced, black-clad families to the arch-miserabalist herself, Queen Victoria.However, the unsmiling faces were often the result of the ridiculously long exposure times, which required fixed expressions. The beauty of this album is that whilst it contains many conventional portraits, there are also quite a few snapshots of people smiling and having fun.Unlike many of the albums I've come across, there are names, places and dates. For example, the two photos below have the caption \"Characters Represented in a Charade at 'The Bank'. Jan 17th 1873.\"The gentleman in the Widow Twankey outfit is called Charlie Wright.On the opposite page, there is a scene from another production called \"The Proposal\":But it isn't just the theatrical productions that appeal. I also like scenes from family life, some of which are surprisingly relaxed and informal, by Victorian standards:You might argue that whoever complied this collection had too much time on their hands, but compare this to the nadir of photo albums: the 1970s Selfix variety, with adhesive pages and Kodak Instamatic pictures. Not only were they hideously ugly, but they didn't even work. My parents' albums started to disintegrate in 1982.Those were the days. Perhaps this genetleman would have eyed my car with envy, but I'd happily swap my boring, dependable Citroën  Xsara Picasso for a horse (top hat included, of course).Was he a cad and a bounder? Did he get one of the maidservants up the duff?What I like about this photo is that we may be looking at the face of a man who was born in the 18th century. He would certainly have been alive when the Battle of Waterloo took place.There are many people in the album, but this page apears to include the major figures in the circle of friends and family.This young man, adopting a \"So we meet again, Mr Bond\" pose, is the centrepiece of the page. Who is he?I've Googled the names - John Alfred Gotch, Rose H Marriott, Lionel L Powell, E Kate Hickson, Robert S Hawks and Charlie Wright. They have all drawn blanks apart from John Alfred Gotch, but I think it may be a false lead.The album doesn't mention where these people lived, but most of the place names mentioned are in Cheshire and Lancashire: Rock Ferry, Whitefield, Manchester and Southport. There also seems to be a connection with Melton Mowbray.I shall have to do some more research. There is a story to be told, although I think it's unlikely that I have a bestselling non-fiction title in the making. Kate Sumerscale can sleep safely in her bed.What strikes me most of all is what an interesting, likeable, rather Bohemian crowd of people they must have been (a stark contrast to the rather austere folk of Grimsby in the photos I published ten days ago). They appear to have led a rich life and come across as the antithesis of the stereotypical image of the Victorians.How sad that this beautiful album almost ended up on a landfill site."},
{"title": "Ten Tips for Young Ladies", "date": "Thursday, December 03, 2009", "text": "I found a wonderful book today called \"Confidential Chats with Girls\", written a century ago by a doctor called William Lee Howard.The book is mainly preoccupied with the physical changes that take place during puberty, but Doctor Howard decided to go beyond his original remit and share the following pearls of wisdom.Young ladies, take note:Don't dress in a loud and gaudy maner unless you wish to attract men of loud and loose principlesDon't have any pity for flies and insects - kill themDon't be a giggling girl. The practice of giggling will certainly develop those tiny skin muscles in a way to make your face show some kind of distortionIf you have flushed your intestines with water and fruit, you may eat all the cakes and sugar you wishAvoid all thoughts, reading or association which will affect the nervous system, if you wish to have a beautiful complexionThe dressing of the feet is, perhaps, the first thing a refined and cultivated man looks at. The girl who displays high-heeled shoes and thin silk stockings on a winter's day, may attract attention, but not respectWoolen undergarments are a most prolific source of mischiefDon't use arsenic in any form for your complexion or to give your face a plump appearanceDon't swagger around in public nor attempt to thrust yourself forward. A modest girl will not let herself become prominent in public placesYou are safer in kissing a person with consumption than you are in wetting your finger to turn over the pages of a bookSo there you have it. In short: stay in the background, eat cakes and kill flies. But don't wear woolen undies. As far as feet are concerned, I think that Dr Howard has his own agenda."},

{"title": "Candy and Andy", "date": "Monday, November 30, 2009", "text": "In 1966, at the height of his powers, \"supermarionation\" creator Gerry Anderson came up with a bold concept for a new television series. He had already designed the puppets and with the recent success of Thunderbirds behind him, it looked certain that the new project would be given the green light.But there was one problem: Anderson's idea was utterly mad.The new series was given a unanimous thumbs down by television executives, but undeterred, Anderson turned his idea into a franchise, spawning 154 issues of a comic and several books. The whole sorry episode lasted less than three years but it was long enough to screw-up a generation of under 5s.Welcome to the world of \"Candy and Andy\":Candy and Andy are just like any other children, except that they are plastic and live with two panda bears called Mr and Mrs Bearanda. They drive around in a Mini called Stripey.The Candy and Andy books fail to explain the children's relationship with the Bearandas. It is clearly not a genetic bond, so were Candy and her brother adopted? Is Andy even Candy's brother? We are never told.With their panda parents, Candy and Andy live in a world of humans (and a talking hedgehog). It should be enchanting, but the reality is deeply disturbing.A slightly coquettish pose from Candy.In Candy and Andy's world, you do talk to strangers. Oddly enough, these strangers are never alarmed by the presence of two sinister dolls.A moment of reflection.This photo is the stuff of nightmares, with Candy and Andy sitting on the lap of an evil-looking Father Christmas. This was the era before CRB checks, when perverts and sex offenders were able to find work as store Santas. This one looks as if he's just been released from Parkhurst.I inherited a Candy and Andy book when I was three and forgot all about it until this year, when I started suffering from flashbacks. Perhaps it was my new job. If Proust was inspired to write a mammoth novel from the whiff of a few cakes, what hope did I have with thousands of books at my disposal?There is another disturbing aspect to this story. I am a hardcore rationalist, but one day I saw a box of books and the words \"Candy and Andy\" came into my head. I started to unpack the contents and there, lying at the bottom, was the first Candy and Andy book I had seen since I was three. I now know the meaning of the phrase \"sent a shiver down my spine\".Candy and Andy has been conveniently airbrushed out of Gerry Anderson's career history. There is no mention of them on Wikipedia and apart from one dedicated 1960s website, I can only find a few cursory references.There are probably thousands of people in Britain who shudder at the sight of dolls without knowing why and find themselves suffering from recurring nightmares about talking pandas and psychedelic Minis. Like most traumas from early childhood, these memories are deeply repressed.Perhaps it is time to form a support group for victims of Candy and Andy. We may have had our childhoods stolen by the weird, perverted fantasies of Gerry Anderson, but at least we can work together to end the nightmares.NB - If you're wondering what happened to Candy and Andy, I'm told that Candy made a few soft porn films in the 1970s, before marrying a millionaire property speculator. She now manages a chain of high class hotels. Andy never managed to cope with the transition from child star to adult and his last acting role was in 1987, at a pantomime in Swindon. He was arrested last year for stealing a Breville Sandwich Maker from a branch of John Lewis. He still lives with Mrs Bearanda."},
{"title": "Northern Lights", "date": "Friday, November 27, 2009", "text": "I have just had a long, hot bath in an attempt to remove a thick layer of dust and grime from a day in a warehouse. My days as a foppish aesthete are long gone; I could go to a working men's club and look them all squarely in the eye.Most baths seemed to be designed for midgets, so two years ago I bought the largest one I could find and I can now enjoy the bliss of being fully immersed in water. As an added bonus, the tap sometimes drips a syncopated, atonal tune that sounds like the theme tune of The Time Tunel. All I need is a Saul Bass intro sequence.I've spent most of this week in the warehouse, throwing books away. It feels counter-intuitive to consign books to oblivion, but the alternative is a building that is mostly full of crap. By throwing  the MS-Dos manual from 1992 or the collections of Reader's Digest condensed books, I can make more room for the titles that deserve to survive.As expected, I found a few gems, including these photos from the album of a Lincolnshire family:The first thing that came into my mind was \"How Northern.\" It's not just the flat cap, but also the faces, particularly the man's.I wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of this couple.A suitably bleak, wintry background for this couple. The man is clearly a master of Ecky Thump (Wikipedia link added for the 90% of readers who will be baffled by this).One word: conditioner.Here is clear evidence that, contrary to popular myth, Moslems successfully integrated into British society long before the 1950s.Lincolnshire clearly enjoyed a vibrant gay scene, even 90 years ago.DittoThis soldier is taking five cameras to the Front. I suppose it's hard to get film out there.A traditional childhood scene, apart from the cool, time-travelling boy with the polo-neck sweater.This woman is oblivious to the fact that a small UFO is hovering above her head.This hussy is brazenly revealing her right hand. Whatever next?Children's fashions were clearly far superior to contemporary styles.95 years on, there is still a school in Edward Street.Unlike the other photo albums I've come across, there are two clues to its origin: the surname Ladley and the town of Grimsby. I know next to nothing about Grimsby, except that it is an important port. I doubt I'll ever go there.A quick check on Wikipedia reveals that Grimsby features in the PlayStation 3 game \"Resistance: Fall of Man\". Wikipedia also mentions the fact that a Grimsby sex shop owner was fined £5,800 because customers successfully complained to Trading Standards that his films weren't pornographic enough.But to return to the album, it is sad that these photos have ended up in the hands of strangers. The album was carefully compiled and although it may not have been done for posterity, I think that most of us hope that future generations, whether they are direct descendants or nieces and nephews, will act as custodians of what we were.This album reached the end of the line and was destined to be thrown in a skip.I like the idea that these photos will probably now been seen by more people than ever. I hope the Ladleys would approve."},

I know that values have changed, but was there ever a time when that was high praise?I'm afraid to say that I have sent a lot of Monica Dickens novels to be \"recycled\" (i.e. turned into road surfacing material) during the last few days. Like many middlebrow novelists who were incredibly popular in their time, Monica Dickens' books have no value today, as the supply far outstrips the demand. This is a great pity, as what I've read of Dickens compares favourably with many contemporary writers of popular fiction.Monica Dickens was an interesting character. She was born into a privileged background and went to St Paul's Girls' School, but in her youth she chose to become a domestic servant and gained an insight into life \"below stairs\". I wonder if her great-grandfather's writing influenced this eccentric decision?In the 1970s, her Follyfoot children's novels were succesfully adapted for television. I was going to include the title sequence of the programme, but that was before I discovered the magic of Richard Shireby and his electronic organ, playing Follyfoot's memorable theme tune:"},

In the meantime, these are what caught my eye today:There are times when an author photo isn't a good idea. The blurb beneath says that \"W. H.

{"title": "Birthday", "date": "Tuesday, November 17, 2009", "text": "My youngest son is now four. We held a party for him on Sunday and as far as these things go, it appeared to be a great success. It lasted for two hours, which seems to be the unspoken rule for how long a party for young children should last.I'm not sure how this consensus emerged. Perhaps it's the maximum amount of time that anyone can bear, or maybe the children start crying and wanting to use the potty after the chime of the second hour. Either way, I'm not complaining.I was very well behaved. I was under instructions not to offer wine to the adults or play any Gary Glitter tracks, so I helpfully brewed cups of Fairtrade coffee and changed the CBeebies compilation CDs every 45 minutes.It started off very well. The children and mothers went up to my son's bedroom, while I remained downstairs, reading the Sunday papers. Unfortunately, halfway into a review of The White Ribbon, they all piled into the dining room and I felt obliged to be sociable.My presence was completely superfluous. I wasn't able to contribute anything to the conversation about the merits of different playgroups and stood leaning against the wall, smiling inanely, making an occasional platitudinous contribution to the discussion.My wife said that she could see the agony on my face.It's not as if I'm not the sort of person who is happiest talking sport with the boys. I feel equally comfortable (or uncomfortable) talking to men or women and the three mothers who attended the party were all likeable, interesting, highly accomplished people. But I couldn't get rid of the feeling that I was a spare part.I shall have to invent a pressing DIY task next year.Birthdays are bittersweet occasions. On the one hand, I felt elated that the strange little blue creature who almost died four years ago (from having an umbilical cord wrapped around his neck) is now a healthy, happy, bright little boy with a wonderful sense of humour. On the other, I feel sad that it won't be that long before the innocence and endearing malapropisms are replaced with talk of PS3s and Wii games.At the moment, thanks to a diet of Ladybird books, my son is convinced that it is 1961.

Is main too plain?).I rarely listen to it, but I do catch up with the podcast which features highlights from the previous week.Last week's podcast contained highlights from the Free Thinking Festival in Gateshead and included a fascinating talk by Dr Gwen Adshead, a consultant psychotherapist at Broadmoor. The name Broadmoor will probably mean nothing to anyone outside the UK, so I should explain that it is a top security psychiatric hospital and houses many of Britain's most dangerous criminals. If Hannibal Lecter was English, he'd be in Broadmoor.Dr Adhead's talk was called \"A Woman's Right to Be Evil\" and was one of the most interesting and humane things I've heard for a long time.

The book consists of 48 pages of questions and answers with a French actor called Fernandel - not a fascinating concept in itself, but made more appealing by the fact that Fernandel's answers are limited to body language.Here are a few examples:\"We Americans are very much against sin. How about you, Monsieur?\"\"Does the average Frenchman still pinch pretty girls in a crowd?\"\"Do you know that here this kind of conduct will land one in jail?\"\"What would you rather give up - women or garlic?\"\"As a Frenchman, what do you think of American sweater girls?\"\"We hope that you have tasted our California champagne?\"What is it about the French? In any other country, a strange nose, bad teeth and a generally odd face would be considered a handicap. However, in France it's all part of the je ne sais quois, the joi de vivre and the honi soir qui mal y pense. It's one of many things I admire about France.But before I launch into a homage (or should that be hommage) to the French and their rich artistic and culinary heritage, I'd like to ask Fernandel two questions:Why is Kevin now one of the most popular baby names in France?Why are the French taking more antidepressants than any other nation in Europe?What would Fernandel say?*Triva fact - Fernandel is mentioned by Camus in L'Etranger, when Meursault and Marie watch him in a film."},

I thought I hated it, but that was before I visited Orford, last Thursday:\r\rOnce a bustling medieval seaport, now a sleepy coastal village at the end of an empty, 12-mile road, Orford appears to be an unspoilt relic of an England that died long ago.\r\rThere are no adverts, chain stores or grafitti and apart from the occasional car, the only noises to be heard are the cries of gulls and curlews. A good place to set a murder mystery.\r\rOverlooking the village is the keep of the 12th century Orford Castle:\r\rI have no idea why some castles seem to attract coachloads of visitors whilst others are virtully empty, but I'm grateful that there are places where it's still possible to be alone.\r\rI don't believe in the supernatural, but I was intrigued by an argument that ancient buildings are like magnetic tape, resonating with echoes of previous inhabitants. It's nonsense, I'm sure, but it feels true.\r\rThe ticket office was staffed by a man who apeared to have taken his inspiration from Uriah Heep, with a manner that was superficially obsequious, but with an underlying menace. He was quietly insistent  that I should take advantage of the free audio tour, but I wanted to enjoy the silence.\r\r\r\r\r\rAt the top of the castle, there is a wonderful panoramic view of Orford and the surrounding area. I felt like Roger Livesey in 'A Matter of Life and Death', looking down at the village in his camera obscura.\r\rFree from the usual roar of traffic, I could hear almost everything, from the footsteps of someone walking through the village square to the slow scraping of a boat being dragged by hand across shingle.\r\rLandscapes may be regarded as a symbol of permanance in an ephemeral world, but the view from the castle would have been completely different when Eleanor of Aquitaine began the voyage to ransom her  son, Richard the Lionheart.\r\rIt is thought that Orford Ness, a long spit of land that separates the village from the sea, didn't exist in medieval times. Today, the only way of reaching open waters is to turn right, out of the port and sail for several miles.\r\r\r\rA few miles north is Aldeburgh (pronounced Awlbruh), where Benjamin Britten established the  famous music festival.

The gift shops stock designer bath caps at £15 a throw. And at weekends, metropolitan holiday-homers turn the place into Boden-on-Sea, the social embodiment of smart-casual.   This is Umbria-in-Anglia, with prawn-pink and pale-primrose holiday cottages rented out at up to £1,600 a week. Hollyhocks in the gardens, dried starfish and model lighthouses in the front windows, bicycles with wicker baskets propped up against the fences.   On dull days, when the sea is a melancholy browny-grey, it’s a place to read P. D. James and listen to Test Match Special, and watch Ayckbourn or Wilde at the Jubilee Hall summer theatre.   “They’re all lords and ladies here, all Captains and Sirs,” says a shop assistant. “Don’t get me wrong, they’re lovely people, but they’re the only ones who can afford to live here.”     And there, as they say, is the rub. This entire stretch of coast, with its winning combination of beautiful landscapes, unspoilt, historic villages and a thriving arts scene, has made the local housing unaffordable to the average punter. I suspect that many traditional Orford families now live in the less aesthetically pleasing environs of Ipswich.\r\rThere were a few fishermen down by the quay who commented on what a \"Boo'ful evenin'\" it was, but they seemed like extras in a play that was populated by an almost exclusively middle class cast. If Orford seems frozen in time, that may be because the average age of its citizens is several decades older than the national average. During my visit, two days ago, almost everyone I saw was white, middle class and over 50.\r\rThe Jolly Sailor pub seemed traditional enough, but my lunch was served by a slightly scary eastern European girl  who barked \"Fiss? Fiss? Fiss?\" until I nodded my ascent. What had happened to the locals?\r\rI don't blame people for wanting to live in an episode of Midsomer Murders, but I'm glad that Lewes is still a working town with a broad social mix (albeit heavily weighted towards graduates). Orford was beautiful, but it felt like a gated community and given the house prices, it effectively was."},
{"title": "Rockwell Kent and Moby Dick", "date": "Tuesday, October 27, 2009", "text": "Moby Dick is one of my favourite novels and for a while I became quite obsessed with it, to the point where I made a pilgrimage to New Bedford and visited the Seamen's Bethel church that appears in the first chapter of the book. I expected to find a nice, twee tourist site. Surprisingly, the church had hardly changed at all in 150 years and the entrance was blocked by a gang of menacing-looking sailors. They even had proper beards.It is a tribute to Melville's genius that he managed to make such a boring book so compelling. In the hands of a lesser author, the seemingly endless digressions and meditations on whaling and life at sea would be intolerable. But Moby Dick is like a long, utterly mad, epic poem, in the tradition of The Wanderer and The Seafarer.Last week I came across an edition of Moby Dick published in the 1920s, with wonderful illustrations by Rockwell Kent. I looked the book up, hoping that it worth be worthless enough to give me an excuse to keep it for myself, but it was worth £30. It sold three days later.Here is a brief selection of Kent's brilliant illustrations:"},
{"title": "Still More Bookmarks", "date": "Thursday, October 22, 2009", "text": "I feel as if I'm in one of those James Bond films where 007 is on a treadmill and the hand of an unseen assailant suddenly turns up the speed dial. Obviously you or I would just get off, but for some reason Bond always remains in place and tries to keep up (if it's Roger Moore, a slight eyebrow movement conveys extreme distress).I'm in the same predicament. Every day I receive an increasing number of deliveries of secondhand books and I am struggling to keep up. But on the plus side, this has resulted in the discovery of some wonderful impromptu bookmarks:It's nice to know that some people can find these sorts of photo opportunities amusing, even when they're in their fifties.I think it's the same man, but this time he's presenting a bouquet of flowers to a mystery woman who could be Margaret Thatcher. The costumes look flammable.Continuing the British Prime Ministerial theme, I found this in a collection of poems by Mary Wilson (the Prime Minister's wife, not the soul singer). If Harold Wilson doesn't mean much to you, he was the Prime Minister of Britain during the Swinging Sixties and two of his most controversial decisions were awarding the MBE to the Beatles and refusing to join the Vietnam War.This is the Magna Carta memorial at Runnymede. It's a pity that the memorial looks more like a 25th century teleportation portal, because it deserves something either grander or simpler, if that makes any sense. I like the woman's trouser suit. Without the Magna Carta, she probably wouldn't be wearing it.This is a lovely poem about Heaven and the animals. The assertion that animals don't possess souls has been a matter of theological controversy for some time: \"But when I die, I know that Tiddles will be up there waiting for me.\" Unfortunately, the poem's earnest message is slightly undermined by a simple typo:On a more serious note:I used to be the Chief Prosecutor of the Anti-Baby League. I would wince at the sound of cryinging infants and cringe at the insipid coochie coo talk of their mothers. I'd probably find this photo a bit soppy. But I've crossed the line and in addition to now being impervious to the most ear-piercing infantile screaming, I find this picture very touching.The name Annie Besant may be familiar to some. She was a prominent campaigner for women's rights during the Victorian age and today, is perhaps best known for her role in the Matchgirls Strike of 1888. I found this signature in a book published by the Theosophical Society. I've added a link to her name, as Besant was a remarkable person.I've no idea who this is and I'm hopeless at reading handwriting, but if anyone can decipher the name I'd love to know more.Welcome to the discomfort zone. If you ever succumb to nostalgia for the past, just remember that this sort of thing went on. The woman looks familiar. Wasn't she Chinese a minute ago? But if the sight of people \"blacking up\" is beyond the pale (pun intended), it's nothing compared to this:This comes from a  1932 edition of Hooey Magazine and next time I feel depressed about living in the 21st century, I shall look at this cartoon and remind myself of the alterative.To continue the racism theme, here is an advert from a 1955 edition of the Daily Mail Ideal Home book:Here's a world where white people can whizz around Africa in fast cars, occasionally condescending to stop and buy some trinkets from the locals. See? Everyone's happy. I doubt if the Daily Mail's readers were aware of the existence of the ANC or of a young man in his 30s called Nelson Mandela, who was already making a name for himself."},

Most of the day is spent in a quiet, civilised office, where the only sounds are the gentle whirring of computer fans and the tapping of keyboards. However, once or twice a day I have to venture into the warehouse to find some books:This is only a small section of what I have to deal with. There are around one thousand of these blue plastic totes, with more being added every day. Although I now have four people helping me, we are barely scratching the surface.As I look through the totes and try to identify any valuable titles, I can hear Heart FM playing a selection of \"classic tracks\". I had hoped that I would never again have to listen to Phil Collins singing Sussudio, but he's a regular fixture on their playlist.Last week, we received hundreds of law books, most of which were from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. I've no idea what to do with them. I have put a few on sale, but so far there haven't been any takers and I wonder how many people there are who want to read about the laws of conveyancing in the 1860s.I don't want to throw the books away, but it would be a waste of time to spend up to a week logging them on the internet. I have tried selling them to a company that specialises in decorative books, but they weren't interested. I know a \"geezer\" who will take them off my hands for a few quid, but I want to explore every option first.Does anyone have any bright ideas?"},
{"title": "Ticket to Rye", "date": "Saturday, October 17, 2009", "text": "I have arranged to meet an old schoolfriend for a drink. He lives 85 miles away, in Kent, so we always meet in Rye, which is roughly halfway. Aside from the fact that Rye is a beautiful, historic town with many literary connections (Henry James, E.F. Benson, Radclyffe Hall and John Christopher, to name a few), it is also the perfect venue as our trains, which come from oppoite directions, arrive and depart within seconds of each other. It is as if the whole south coast rail network has been arranged so that we can have a drink.I love the walk to Lewes station, even on a grey autumnal day like this. My route takes me past the Fifteenth Century Bookshop, down Keere Street (where George IV is supposed to have driven a coach and four horses down to the bottom for a wager) and across to the Elizabethan Southover Grange, the boyhood home of diarist John Evelyn.At Southover Grange, a member of the local Stasi is on patrol, hoping to find a victim. The parking scheme was introduced to Lewes five years ago and I now how to pay £75 a year for the privilege of parking outside my own house.Last week I received a parking ticket, placed on my windscreen at 6.35am, so it would be fair to say that I have a grudge.A year after the parking scheme was introduced, it was decided to replace (at huge expense) the attendants' red jackets, as it was felt that this colour was \"too aggressive\". I would have thought that employing an army of unsympathetic, bonus-driven attendants was more likely to provoke aggression.Before I get to the station, I pop into the beautiful Grange gardens:Although it is now autumn, the gardens are still in colour and on a quiet morning like this, it is easy to forget that you are in the 21st century.But something has gone wrong. The health and safety people have moved in and everywhere I look, there are warning signs, makeshift fences and stumps where potentially dangerous trees have been cut down.What is the justification for this:WARNING. WATERCOURSE RUNNING THROUGH GARDENS.This sign can only be seen as you are leaving, by which time the warning will be superfluous. What possessed the local authorities to place such a garish notice on this mostly sixteenth century wall? They could at least have come up with a sympathetic pastiche; something like \"An ille feyte betides those who take no heede of yonder waters.\"I leave the gardens in a despondent mood. I'm a great believer in the small is beautiful principle and would like to see more local government, but not if the result is a lot of small-minded people with no vision issuing petty edicts and restrictions.Railway stations aren't normally the most uplifting places, but Lewes Station cheers me up. In contrast to Southover Grange - a beautiful place made ugly by people with no imagination - the staff at Lewes Station have turned a purely functional environment into one that is full of delight.From the station cafe that plays classical music to the carefuly-planted flowers, everything about Lewes Station is good. There is no litter or graffiti and the polite, helpful staff have an Ealing comedy cheeriness about them.One day I was standing on the edge of the platform as a train was coming in and my rarely-used mobile phone rang. I was so surprised to receive a call that I jumped and inadvertently threw the phone up into the air. It landed on the track, narrowly missing being crushed by the arriving train.In a London station, I would have had to miss my train, go to an office and fill out a form in front of some dour-faced apparatchik, but in Lewes I simply had a quick word with one of the staff and the phone was waiting for me later that evening.The journey to Rye is ridiculously slow, taking an hour and ten minutes to travel 43 miles, but I don't mind. Most of the journey is through empty fields - for such a densely-populated corner of Britain, there are still plenty of open spaces - and at one point the railway line reaches the coast, passing rows of beach huts.My carriage is remarkably quiet until a woman gets on at Bexhill. She is in the middle of a phone conversation and talks in an annoying transatlantic accent. Some transatlantic accents are pleasing to the ear (Cary Grant and Alistair Cooke spring to mind), but others are hideous. I was reading a book*, but all I can hear now is \"Yah, well I think we're going to have to go back to BLT. I mean, we were quite firm with them about what it involved...yah...yah...\"At first, I thought that she was talking about a sandwich order, but it transpires that BLT is a company. The woman she is talking to sqeaks like a mouse from the receiver and she responds with further yahs, then the train briefly enters a tunnel. She redials. \"Sorry, I just lost you there. We went through a tunnel. Yah. Anyway, we'll get back to BLT and...hello?\"We are in another tunnel. A long one. One minute she is connected to a global network of Serious People doing Very Important Things. Now she is alone.I look round and see a short, rather plain woman on the cusp of middle-age, wearing a cheap-looking flanelette track suit. Not what I was expecting. She gets off at Hastings and I wonder what she is going to do there.The journey from Hastings to Rye takes us through countryside that looks more like East Anglia, with flat empty fields and muddy drainage ditches. Even on a bright, sunny day, there is something depressing about this landscape.In Rye, my friend's train arrives five seconds after mine. We go to The George, where we begin a conversation that becomes more opinionated and less articulate with each drink. By the third pint, I can sense a decline in my cognitive abilities and I drink more slowly, but it is always too late. My memory of the evening is hazy, but I feel a happiness that will sustain me for days to come.I arrive at Lewes Station just after 9.00. The walk home takes me past houses that are hundreds of years old. I don't believe in the supernatural, but there is a tangible presence in these buildings, whispering \"Memento mori...memento mori...\" Next time I'll stick to soft drinks. *The book was the superb \"Seasonal Suicide Notes\", by Roger Lewis. If the transatlantic woman hadn't boarded the train, I would have read an account of the making of a film set in South Wales starring, improbably, Faye Dunaway. One of her co-stars was Mark Benton - an actor I had never heard of, but recognised in a photo as the fat bloke from the Nationwide Building Society adverts. If I had managed to read two more pages of the book, I might have been quite freaked out, as only half an hour later, Mark Benton entered The George for a lunchtime drink."},
{"title": "The Eighties Revival Stops Here...", "date": "Wednesday, October 14, 2009", "text": "I didn't like the 1980s. If the technology had existed, I would have gone into suspended animation until the reappearance of sideburns. I had spent my childhood preparing for long hair, flared trousers and loud shirts and felt cheated when someone changed the rules before I'd started to shave.I could have quite happily lived without Margaret Thatcher, Red Wedge, Cyndi Lauper, Live Aid, Stock, Aitken and Waterman, Filofaxes, Tiffany, Huey Lewis and the News, Ronald Reagan, Back to the Future, Phil Collins, Rick Astley, Dirty Dancing, highlights, Hooked on Classics, Lionel Richie, T'Pau, Mini Metros and the Green Goddess.But I would have missed The Smiths.If you're suffering from Eighties nostalgia (or False Memory Syndrome, as it's more properly known), here is a reminded of what it was really like, courtesy of a 1984 My Guy annual that I found yesterday:The 1980s was the era of the sexy jumper. The Tehran morality police would surely approve of this girl's outfitEvery young girl dreamed of looking like a dowdy, middle-aged woman. This girl's wish came trueOn the plus side, transexuals were able to blend in more easily.A strange fashion for hairstyles that looked like bad wigs became very popularEighties hair is coming back for men, but oddly enough today's women aren't following suit. I can't think whyAre sideburns unfashionable again? I've noticed that when I've had my haircut recently, people ask me if I'd like them removed. Naturally I recoil in horror and steadfastly refuse. If I'm not careful, today it will be the sideburns; tomorrow, highlights and hair gel.The 1980s stop here."},
{"title": "Censorship", "date": "Tuesday, October 13, 2009", "text": "Given the circumstances of my acrimonious departure from Waterstone's, I think I've exercised considerable restraint on this blog. Yes, I've taken the odd pot shot, but most of the time I resisted temptation, because listening to someone droning on bitterly about their former partner or boss is very boring, not to mention counter-productive.Earlier this year, I got out my magnetic self-help cliches kit and decided to move on, get over it and achieve closure. I had a new, better job. It was time to put the past behind me.But I've never quite been able to get over the fact that the company I loved - Ottakar's - was taken over by one that was run by a cabal of people who didn't read (I thought that the baddies were supposed to lose?), so it was with extreme satisfaction that I read these two articles in the Bookseller.If you can't be bothered to follow the link (and I won't hold it against you), here is a potted history of recent events:Three years ago, Waterstone's acquired a new managing director, Gerry Johnson. With increased competition from the internet and supermarkets, Waterstone's sales were beginning to shrink, so Johnson's brief was to reverse the process. He had three big ideas:Establish a proper transactional websiteIntroduce a loyalty card schemeIntroduce central distribution for all stock itemsThe first two were, to use my least favourite phrase, a no-brainer. However, the third was more controversial. Johnson's rationale was this: a centralised \"Hub\" would reduce distribution costs, enabling Waterstone's to ask publishers for higher discounts. It would also make the goods-in staff redundant, enabling Waterstone's to save at least £4,000,000 in staff costs.I expect that Johnson calculated that the savings made from getting rid of staff and closing underperforming shops (which was done very quietly, with the minimum of publicity), plus the inceased revenue from the dot.com site, the loyalty card and various hideous initiatives, would put Waterstone's back into positive figures.But it hasn't worked. The sales are still going down and the Hub, depending on who you talk to, is at best problematic, at worst a disaster.I'm not in a position to comment on the sales figures - perhaps the odds against high street booksellers are too great. However, what interests me most about the comments threads on the Bookseller articles is the depth of feeling. Why has morale sunk so low?As a desperate, knee-jerk reaction, Gerry Johnson has banned booksellers from accessing the Bookseller website. Since the demise of Publishing News, this is the only significant trade journal for the book industry. What is Johnson thinking? It is ironic that Waterstone's, who ran an effective promotion about banned books and censorship a few years ago, are now resorting to such desperate measures."},
{"title": "Health and Safety", "date": "Sunday, October 11, 2009", "text": "Health and Safety has become one of the tabloids' favourite bogeymen. Every time I read my mother's copy of the Daily Mail, there seems to be a story about how killjoy bureaucrats are attacking Britain's long-cherished traditions in the name of health and safety.If a new law is introduced banning young children from holding sparklers, the Daily Mail will somehow manage to interpret it as part of the ongoing conspiracy between Brussels, New Labour, Islamists, environmentalists, gay people and cosmopolitan metrosexual types to emasculate Britain. At no point will there ever be an intelligent debate, informed by some facts.Two days later, a flury of letters will be published from readers, most of whom seem to be called Colin or Jean. Colin will invariably complain that we didn't spend five years fighting Naziism to end up being taken over by a load of foreigners, whilst Jean will blame poor discipline and declining church attendance. Both Colin and Jean will see health and safety regulations as an attack on good old-fashioned common sense and personal responsibilty.However, the Colin and Jeans of this world have short memories. When they were younger, the UK government produced hundreds of public information films that alerted people to a variety of potential hazards, some of which were only marginally more probable than an alien invasion.A quick browse through YouTube shows just how paranoid people were, with films on the following dangers:Slippery floor matsEscalatorsPlaying with frisbees near electricity sub-stationsBurst pipesPolystyrene ceiling tilesCaravan instabilityFlying kites near electricity pylonsParaffin heatersMixing crossply and radial tyresSeparate tapsRunning to catch a busLead in paintRabiesAbandoned fridgesFrostStrangersCasting a fishing line near an overhead power cableAirbedsBicycle theftsSmogFat firesDriving in snowGas cannistersFrozen pondsTo the modern viewer, most of these films seem laughable, but there is one that is still quite chilling:So are we really more obsessed with health and safety these days?I'm not convinced. What has changed is that businesses and organisations are far more anxious to avoid negative publicity and litigation.  As a result, we have become overwhelmed by audits, checklists, compliance policies and training courses to ensure that if something does go wrong, we aren't accountable. It doesn't necessarily make things any safer. I have met people who dutifully fill-in their daily and weekly audits without ever checking the physical environment.One health and safety success story is the decline in the number of pedestrian road deaths during the last 30 years.These two information films feature Darth Vader actor David Prowse, playing Green Cross Man. In the first, his voice has been dubbed with an actor's dulcet RP tones, but in the second, you can enjoy the full glory of Prowse's Bristol accent.It's a pity that it was felt necessary to dub Prowse's voice, but can you imagine the alternative, as demonstrated by Mrs Jones's comment below:\"Luke...Oi aam yourr faahthurr.\""},

She sat kneading them together nervously. What could she tell Charlotte? Would she think she was crazy if she confessed to be a time traveller in search of the truth?\"When I was a bookshop manager I ended up adopting a zero tolerance approach to self-published authors for a number of reasons - mainly because they were a financial drain. I never ceased to be amazed at the way self-published authors could become borderline stalkers for months on end until it was time to return the unsold stock, at which point they suddenly became very elusive.I found this illustration in a boys' adventure story from the Edardian era:The caption reads: \"That - that thing's loaded!\" gasped Flagg. I'm sure that you can can think of other, darker captions...This bookmark refers to a road expansion scheme in north London. I don't know how many people attended the meeting, but it didn't stop the building going ahead. In Britain, the 1990s saw a number of environmentally disastrous road building programmes that went ahead in the face of overwhelming public opposition.To continue the road building theme, the remaining images come from two photograph albums that appeared in our warehouse last week. By coincidence, they are both from 1931 and the albums were destined to be pulped and become part of the M6 motorway extension, but I have rescued some of the photos from oblivion. Sadly, there are no names. I wrote about this issue three years ago (scroll down to \"Restoration\") and I would urge you to follow the advice of a wise, Welsh farmer.The first album features lots of women in funny hats. However, these hats are comfortingly familiar, as I grew up surrounded by great aunts who had been born in the 1890s and 1900s and, fashionwise, seemed to be stuck in the 1920s.I really like this photo. A small technological development - the advent of faster shutter speeds and better photographic film - meant that people no longer had to maintain grim, humourless expressions. The older woman looks particularly interesting. Her clothes suggest that she may have been a \"bluestocking\".The following photographs are from a holiday album from some English people who went to Biarritz and Lourdes:A close-up of the next photo reveals that a lot of the figures are nuns:I love the scene below, with the wet cobbled streets and the vintage car:And also the next image, with the absurdly French man in the beret and the boy in short trousers.The final picture looks lie Hogwarts:I can only assumed that this is a scene from Lourdes, but I don't know. I would love to know more about the people who compiled this photo album, but there isn't a single clue. A sad end to what looked like a rich life. Hoewever although we will never know who took these photographs, I can at least ensure that these images will now be seen be more people than ever."},

Some of the finer points of calculus went over my head, but I understood far more than I expected and it will augment my fraudulent patina of erudition.The beauty of In Our Time is that it whilst refuses to dumb down its content, it doesn't presuppose a detailed knowledge of the subjects under discussion, so Melvyn Bragg will blithely ask his guests 'What exactly is calculus?'. If the guests fail to answer in plain English, Bragg makes them answer the question again. Brilliant.Today I listened to Radio Three's Composer of the Week podcast about the Czech composer Bohuslav Martinů, who died 50 years ago. I've always liked Martinů's music, but knew next to nothing of his life.I was fascinated to learn that like Rapunzel, he grew up in a tower and rarely ventured down to ground level.I have no idea why Martinů's parents lived in the bell tower of the local church (did they have to cover their ears at regular intervals?), but their son was a sickly child and spent the first six years of his childhood looking at his local village from a great height. As an adult, Martinů often expressed a deep nostalgia for his native village, but like many creative artists of the time, prefered to live in Paris.When the Wehrmacht invaded France, Martinů knew that his days in Paris were numbered (he was on the Gestapo's wanted list) and he fled to the United States. In America, Martinů wrote his first symphony and its success encouraged him to compose five others.Everything was going well, until one day Martinů fell from a balcony and cracked his skull on concrete (growing up in a tower should surely have made him more aware of heights). From then on, he suffered from poor health and bouts of depression. He eventually went to live in Switzerland where he died, possibly of boredom.Here is a clip of the Scherzo from the Symphony No.4. It's not a great performance and the conductor's pedestrian tempi detract from the music's jazzy exhuberance, but as this seems to be the only Martinů orchestral clip on YouTube, I'll have to make do.If you don't want to hear the whole clip, jump to 2:12:I hope some of the magic still came through this stolid performance from the Berlin Philharmonic. I'd love to hear the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra put some life into the music."},

I associate it with the Mitford sisters, Noel Coward and just about anyone in an Evelyn Waugh novel. It doesn't feature heavily (in other words I don't think it appears at all but I can't be bothered to do any research) in Victorian fiction, so where did frightful spring from?And where did it go?There is something endearing about the way English people of a certain class used to refer to deeply traumatic events as 'rather unpleasant', whilst an entirely trivial event could be 'frightful'. Behind these phrases lay a tacit acknowledgement that language was inadequate in the face of real tragedy.Today, the public are 'devastated', 'gobsmacked' or 'gutted' when disaster strikes, but never bereft, distraught, anguished, disconsolate, wretched, racked, hopeless, inconsolable or grief-stricken. Ironically, in an age in which we feel freer than ever to express our emotions, the lexicon of gloom is sadly diminished."},
{"title": "Worthless", "date": "Tuesday, September 29, 2009", "text": "I used to marvel at the ability of secondhand booksellers (or should that be sellers of secondhand books) to value titles at a glance. How could they know and, more importantly, how could they be so certain that my Tesco 'Bag for Life' of first editions was worthless? I'd been saving these books for years.After five months in the antiquarian book world, I can now see how it all works. I don't always know which books are worth a fortune, but I can spot the crap a mile away.If you're hanging on to any of the following books, don't even bother giving them to your local charity shop:Any copy of Little Women published after 1880English dictionariesBook club editionsThe Friendship Book (I'm assuming that readers of this blog won't have a copy)Reach for the Sky, by Paul BrickellAll gardening booksThe BibleAll books about the Royal familyComplete works of ShakespeareAnything by J B PriestleyThe plays of George Bernard ShawThe Ascent of Everest, by John Hunt and Sir Edmund HillaryField guides to birds of BritainAll cookery books published after 1945Victorian poetry, particularly LongfellowAll encyclopaediasNovels by 'angry young men' like John BraineEverything published by the AA and Reader's DigestAll Atlases published after 1918Pelican paperbacksThe Pilgrim's ProgressMost books about classical musicHumour titles from the 1950sEnid Blyton paperbacksArt books with black and white reproductions of paintingsAll worthless. Gather the kindling and build the fire! (But not the Bibles - we'll get letters)Last week's local paper's classified ads section had several books for sale. One was a 1936 road atlas, on sale for £25. I presume that the instigators of this advertisement were operating on the premise that if it's old, it's worth something. But this isn't the case. You can buy a beautiful 1850s collection of Wordsworth poems for under a tenner. It's all about supply and demand.I know that some people have reservations about destroying any book, but by throwing out the chaff, I'm able to save the wheat. It's literary eugenics (but not in a sinister, neo-Nazi way).Since April, my project has saved 10,000 books from landfill sites, but it has also condemned at least 20,000 to the big recycling machine. If that bothers you, imagine a future where people are destroying thousands of Dan Brown novels each day, but rescuing first editions of Richard Yates and John Fante.That can't be bad."},
{"title": "Crossing the Line", "date": "Saturday, September 26, 2009", "text": "I still haven't succumbed to to Twitter phenomenon. My life is far too dull to justify 'tweeting' the minutiae of my day. However, if there was a visual equivalent, I might be tempted.I wish that I could share an image I saw this week, as I walked from Lewes Station to my house. It was twilight and if I wanted to be pretentious, I could compare the stunning, dark blue sky to an Yves Klein painting. But I wouldn't do that.I walked past Lord Asa Briggs's house and noticed that a light was on. I stopped and saw Lord Briggs sitting in his book-lined study, huddled over a huge pile of papers. The sight of the 88-year-old scholar deep in thought, oblivious to the outside world, seemed a model of how old age should be. I wanted to capture the moment and share it. But of course, even if I'd had my camera with me, it would be crossing the line to post a photo of someone sitting in the privacy of their own home.I had a similar crossing the line moment earlier this week, when teenage girl's diary turned up in a crate of books. Aside from the fact that it was oblong and had pages, the diary looked nothing like a book, but that didn't stop someone from donating it to a charity shop. If you keep, or have ever kept a diary or journal, be warned: an unlucky encounter with the No.9 bus could see your intimate possessions ending up in the most unlikely places.But to return to the point, I had a teenage girl's diary in my possession. It was neither interesting nor salacious enough to warrant reading, but there were a few amusing passages that could have been worth posting. However, judging by the bad English and texting acronyms, I realised that the diary must have been written very recently. To quote even a single sentence would be crossing the line. I threw it away.But as with copyright and official secrets, time is the great healer and I have no qualms about posting some of the things I have found this week, from photographs to personal albums:Unusually, this photo has something written on the back: Ros's 21st, Dec 67. This picture backs up my theory that for most people, the 1960s were more Austin Rover than Austin Powers.A mystery photo, used as a bookmark in a 1906 publication on cake decoration called Advanced Piping and Modelling. I have no idea where this is.We can laugh, but how many businesses and institutions give the poorest people a 75% discount these days? During my year of unemployment, I noticed that the concessionary rates for people on low incomes were underwhelming.It could be argued that this man did more to prevent the creation of a united Ireland than anyone else. I don't want to steal any thunder from the Catholics and Presbytarians, but Edward Carson was the driving force behind the separation of Ulster from the rest of Ireland. He had his detractors (possibly including the person who drew a moustache on this signed photo).The author of this album decided to remain anonymous, but it is dated 1921:Life is mainly froth and bubbleTwo things stand aloneKindness in another's troubleCourage in our ownThe quote is unattributed, but I have discovered that it is by the so-called national poet of Australia, Adam Lindsay Gordon.This page is more intriguing:If to dream of you by nightand think of you by day:If all the worship wild and deepthat woman's heart can pay,If prayers in absence breathedfor you to Heaven's protective power;If winged thoughts that fly toyou a thousand every hourAnd imagination blending youwith all my future lot -if this you call forgetting - thenindeed you are forgot...Who is Lallie Charles? It seems that she is not the beautiful woman in the photograph, because Lallie Charles was the name of a photographic agency, established by an Englishwoman who was born in 1869.Is the poem an original work? Has it been written as a love poem to the mysterious woman in the photograph? Is this woman a famous actress, or an intimate acquaintance? We will probably never know.I have presented a series of random images, but I always feel as if there has to be a point to it all, so I usually end with some platitudinous epigram about time passing. Today I'll end with a quote:\"Sometimes I feel that life is passing me by, not slowly either, but with ropes of steam and spark-spattered wheels and a hoarse roar of power or terror.  It's passing, yet I'm the one who's doing all the moving.\"  - Martin Amis"},

I tried, because I wanted to gain an insight into the origins of Naziism, but it was dull to the point of being unreadable. Reading Hitler's views on history was like being stuck with a ranting, drunken loon at a bus stop on a quiet Thursday evening in February, or reading the Daily Mail. It was boring nonsense.Ban Mein Kampf and it will acquire the kudos of  forbidden fruit. It is banned in Germany, which is understandable, but wrong. I would like to do the opposite: make everyone read Mein Kampf and marvel at how such a banal, boring book managed to be so influencial."},

{"title": "The Tale of Sir Gerald Nabarro, MP", "date": "Tuesday, September 22, 2009", "text": "This evening I caught a few minutes of the news and had the misfortune to hear an excerpt from the Liberal Party conference. I know very little about their leader, Nick Clegg, but he managed to achieve the seemingly impossible task of making even Gordon Brown look interesting.Unfortunately, Nick Clegg is the rule rather than the exception. In today's media age, politicians are subject to such a high degree of scrutiny that it encourages a culture of blandness and conformity. Where are the mavericks?By coincidence, today I discovered an autobiography by a political maverick from 50 years ago, called Sir Gerald Nabarro. Apparently he was famous in his time...I instantly warmed to Sir Gerald's aristocratic demeanor and ridiculous moustache. He looked like a man who said what he liked, regardless of the party apparatchiks, because he was probably rich enough to be incorruptible and had a strong sense of noblesse oblige.However, a brief amount of research (i.e. Wikipaedia) reveals a different story:Nabarro was born in North London, the son of an unsuccessful shopkeeper. He was born to a prominent Sephardic Jewish family but later converted to Christianity. He was educated at schools run by the London County Council, belying his later image as an aristocrat. On leaving school in 1930 at the age of 16 he enlisted in the Royal Army, in which he served for seven years, rising to the rank of Sergeant. In 1937 he left the army to work as a machine-hand, being swiftly promoted to be factory manager.In the 1950 General Election, Nabarro was elected as an (MP) for Kidderminster, Worcestershire, which he held until 1964. He characterised himself as an old-style Tory: he opposed entry to what is now the European Union, was a proponent of capital punishment, and supported Enoch Powell. In 1963, during an appearance on radio, he said \"How would you feel if your daughter wanted to marry a big buck nigger with the prospect of coffee-coloured grandchildren?\" - remarks which were excised from a repeat of the programme the following week. Comments that like that could have been the kiss of death to Nabarro's political career, but he continued to sit as a Conservative MP and was one of the most popular figures of the 1960s. Nicknamed 'The Abominable Showman', Nabarro claimed that 'Half of Britain swears by me, the other half swears at me.'However, in 1971, Sir Gerald and his company secretary, Margaret Mason, were accused of driving the wrong way around a roundabout. Nabarro was eventually acquitted, but the general consensus was that he had been driving and encouraged his secretary to take the blame. It was hardly Chappaquiddick, but Nabarro found the whole episode very traumatic. A normally healthy man, he suffered two strokes and died at the age of 60.You may think that this is leading up to a point, which could probably be something along the lines of conceding that however bland today's politicians are, at least they don't talk about 'big buck niggers.' But I was more struck by how Nabarro's bigoted comments and eccentric persona could only be the product of someone who was an outsider, insecure about their own social status. If Sir Gerald had been genuinely aristocratic, I doubt that he would have felt so threatened by change.For all his faults, Nabarro did do the British public one inestimable service. He was responsible for the Clean Air Act of 1955, which bought an end to the dreadful London smogs and probably helped to save thousands of lives."},
{"title": "That Riviera Touch", "date": "Sunday, September 20, 2009", "text": "Last week I came across a box of truly horrible books, half-consumed by mould, with a forest of spores clinging to the cloth covers. I always try to clean books and have acquired an arsenal of weapons that include a paint brush, playdo, Mr Sheen, isopropyl alcohol and yellow dusters, but these titles were beyond help. I quickly consigned them to oblivion.The next box didn't look very promising either, but one battered hardback caught my eye and I decided to have a look. It turned out to be a collection of stunning A4-size photographs of the French Riviera in 1900, collected by a woman named Alice Salmon. I Googled the name, but Alice Salmon has disappeared into the ether.Here is a selection from Alice's album. Thanks to the size and quality of the images, I have been able to enlarge some of the details:Nice, circa 1900. I have never been to the French Riviera, but in an ideal world I would go there as an aristocrat in the late-Victorian era. I would call myself the Comte de Lewes.Another scene from Nice. The two men sitting on the bench are looking at the photographer:Unfortunately we cannot see their features properly, but the above detail reveals a third man.A night at the opera in Monte CarloHere is the beautiful Cascade de Chateau in Nice. If you look carefully, you'll notice two figures in the background:This scene looks fairly mundane, but closer scrutiny reveals a disturbing figure..Who is this sinister Scratchman figure?(It looks suspiciously like Michael Jackson)The album contains some wonderful images, but for me the whole experience is tinged with regret. I will never be able to visit the French Riviera in 1900. I will (probably) never know who Alice Salmon was and the figures in the photographs, from the unsettling Scratchman to the two curious gentlemen on the bench, will remain a mystery."},

During the last few months I have come across one object that was specifically designed as a bookmark. The remaining 99% have been scraps of paper, newspaper cuttings, tickets, leaflets and photographs. I feel like a detective, sifting through pieces of evidence. Here are this week's clues:On the back of this photo, someone has written \"Early Mills. Witney. Aug 1938\". It is a great picture and I'm not sure if this reproduction does it justice. Apparently welding excites some people. When I worked at the original Waterstone's in the mid-90s, a man stormed out of a Fay Weldon event because he'd been under the impression that the evening was about welding.They say that there is someone for everyone and I think that this picture supports that view.This is a weird photo. The distance and perspective makes it look as if two extremely small teddy boys are fighting in a tiny stream. This looks a little like one of those Victorian fake 'elves captured on camera' shots. Or maybe not.It's sobering to think that this little girl has probably lived a whole life and died of old age many years ago.A medal, but from whom and for what?Finally, an enigmatic piece of advice that has a slightly disturbing undertone:What does Roy do? Is there a laying on of hands, or a simple cup of tea? The one thing that life has taught me is to never trust people called Danny or Roy, so I would approach the caravan with some trepidation."},

Newcastle-upon-Tyne now has its Millenium Bridge and Baltic Gallery of contemporary art. Birmingham has knocked down its Brutalist 1960s Bull Ring shopping centre, whilst Liverpool recently reinvented itself as the European capital of culture.This is all very good, I'm sure, but there is a simpler and cheaper way to improve our cities. Get rid of the traffic.Yesterday I visited the Mayor's Festival in London and spent a very pleasant afternoon drinking cider in the middle of London Bridge. Only a day earlier the spot where I was sitting had traffic hurtling across it. This weekend, cars and buses and been replaced with tables and sofas. The transformation was magical:It was Jeremy Clarkson's worst nightmare: a car-free city taken over by people selling organic food, morris dancers and musicians. There was even a cow, which provided free milk. The countryside had come to the city and London was a lot better for it.I was struck by different London felt. It seemed a kinder, safer place, but perhaps that was just the Welsh cider lulling me into a stupor of bonhomie. Old people relaxed on sofas, whilst children played with bales of straw. The normal sense of urgency - getting from A to B as quickly as possible and assuming that anyone who smiled at you was mentally ill - had been replaced by something dangerously close to philanthropoy.Even if I take the good weather and convivial company out of the equation, I'm sure I would have still been impressed by the festival, as it showed us how radically we can improve our urban environments. Too many of us uncritically accept the status quo because we have no point of comparison. Events like the Mayor's Festival are a vital opportunity to open people's eyes."},

On my first day I was given a desk, a chair, a computer and 20,000 books. I was also told that there was no budget for my salary and the project had to be 'self-finacing'. No pressure there.Fortunately, I have been lucky. Every crate of books I've opened has yielded at least a dozen really good books, some of which are worth hundreds of pounds (it's shocking to think that these titles used to be dumped on landfill sites) and the sales have been really good. As a result, I am now managing a growing department.This is obviously a 'good thing', but I do have slightly mixed feelings. I love wading through crates of old books and as the sales increase, I seem to be spending an increasing amount of time filling in spreadsheets, dealing with enquiries and managing people. I'm not complaining. I have a really good team and it's great to see the project go from strength to strength, but I don't want to completely lose contact with the books, particularly gems like these:These are all titles that I have found during the last seven days and I can't tell you how happy it makes me to find these gems. I particularly enjoyed The Backward Child, which includes a very useful chapter on how to deal with left-handedness. On a serious note, books like these are utterly chilling (my oldest son suffers from several problems and I've been dismayed by the attitudes of certain people in the teaching profession. I can't begin to imagine what parents must have gone through in the past).The Onanism title was produced by a Catholic publisher (I'm not an expert on these matters, but if you're going to demand clerical celibacy, is it really fair to stop priests taking the law into their own hands?).  Like being left-handed, the aim of this book is to make people feel bad about what comes naturally.As for the two remaining jackets, they're a refreshing change from the predictable designs of modern book covers. They may be the work of madmen, but at least they're not dull.As my department gets bigger, the number of strange book jackets and intriguing bookmarks I come across will diminish, but all hope is not lost. I appear to have recruited some like-minded peple who also appreciate the joys of garish covers and mysterious ephemera, so I hope that they'll furnish me (and you) with further gems."},

The vast majority of total titles published are midlist titles, though they represent a much smaller fraction of total book sales, which are dominated by bestsellers and other very popular titles.\" - WikipediaIt used to be said that books were contra-recessionary items. The logic was that if people cut back on luxury goods, meals out and holidays, then this was good news for the book trade. However, judging by recent events in the book world, this is no longer the case. The recession has finally hit the publishing industry and there are rumours of an imminent cull of midlist authors.Who are these midlist authors whose books don't really sell? I have struggled to think of some names and perhaps that's part of the problem. Besides, if I start mentioning names I'll probably get comments like this:\"X continues to write fiction, nonfiction, scripts for film, and this year a play of his was staged in London. He has won numerous awards and his novels continue to be reviewed with high praise. Notably, X, published this year in the States and, I believe, in the UK in 2006. He teaches at X University. He has a website. One of the best writers working today.\" I have mixed feelings about the midlist. On the one hand, as a bookseller, I found it quite soul-destroying to be shown one novel after another by an author whose books never sold. Why were these titles being published? I often asked the sales reps and the answers I got ranged from 'library sales' to a hand-wringing 'I wish I knew, mate.'But one the other hand, thank God that publishers support their authors. I remember when Ian Rankin was a midlist crime novelist, loved by his readers, but never reaching the bestseller lists. Rankin had been writing the Inspector Rebus stories for ten years before he became an 'A' list author.Only a few authors are overight successes. Most take years to find their voice. The traditional role of a publisher was to recognise talent and nurture it. In today's climate, there is a danger that a culture of short-termism will rob us of some of the next decade's most interesting voices."},
{"title": "In Praise of Folly", "date": "Thursday, September 03, 2009", "text": "I  found some wonderful books today, but nothing came close to the joy I felt when I discovered a collection of programmes for performances by the Southport Musical Society. I know nothing about Southport. I believe that, in spite of its name, it is in a place called The North, but that's as much as I know. However, when I saw these programmes I knew I'd struck gold.The first thing that struck me was the comic aspect of amateur productions - the frustrated ambitions of bank clerks, car salesmen and secretaries, most of whom probably secretly harbour dreams of being discovered. These photos reveal the vanities of the cast:David Ramsbottom - Perchance to DreamJohn Holden - a pensive momentJune Davies - the 'Dancing Mistress'Eddie Hamer - \"One day...\"The dancing girls - all smiles, but viciously competing for a solo part in the next productionThe Mayor - \"I shall be dead soon, but the Society will endure.\"It's easy to laugh. But as I looked through the programmes, I was also struck by the sheer professionalism of these amateurs. From the quality of the programmes, which were immaculately produced, to the ambitiousness of the productions, I soon found myself admiring David Ramsbottom and his fellow members.In Revolutionary Road, Frank and April Wheeler mock the local amateur dramatic society and the small town attitudes of their neighbours. They are going to live in Paris and mix with intellectuals. In the end, their vain conceits make the Wheelers seem far more ridiculous than their am-dram contemporaries.I like the fact that there are thousands of building society clerks, estate agents, retail managers and local government officers who have a secret passion for musical theatre. And instead of sitting around feeling frustrated with their mundane lives, they meet like-minded people and put on a show. I will never go to see their shows, but lots of people will.Perhaps I'm going soft, but I couldn't help thinking of the wonderful ending to Middlemarch:\"...for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.\"(PS - A quick search has revealed that the society has indeed endured, although it now goes under the name of the Southport Amateur Operatic Society. One of the leading lights in the society appears to be the grandchild of one of the stars of 1954's Rio Rita)"},

As the plane hit 30,000 feet, I realised that I had been sold a dud. Sir Leigh f***ing Teabing?

B is a classy prostitute.' Oh, that old chestnut.I wonder if it ever became a finished novel?This extract from a 1969 letter needs no explanation or comment. You'd have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by the grandfather's expression of love.Finally, a notice from Christina Foyle, apologising for sending the wrong title to a book club member. She refers to some 'difficulties', which is a slight understatement, given that the year was 1943."},

I'm sure they have their reasons, but the BBC probably has the greatest audio archive in the world and they should make it more accessible.In contrast, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation has made every episode of their wonderful book review programme available for downloading. Presented by Ramona Koval, the Book Show is as good as anything I've heard, with intelligent interviewers, fascinating guests and a very cosmopolitan selection of writers.Ramona Koval is an exceptionally good presenter and when she interviewed M J Hyland recently about This is How, it was clear that she had really read the book and had a number of thoughtful, pertinent questions to ask.From now on, my drive to work will be accompanied by the archives of The Book Show."},

It was good, wholesome stuff. Just the sort of book you'd award as a school prize, to reward 'good conduct' and 'diligence'.This copy of Timothy's Resolve was awarded to a boy called Robert Swift:Unfortunately, Robert Swift didn't receive his prize with good grace and the back endpaper looks like this:I wonder where Robert Swift is today. If he's alive, he'll be in his sixties and I wonder how he'd regard his juvenile scribblings.I have a lot of sympathy with Master Swift. As a boy, I was forever being given books that I didn't want to read. Even at eight, it was clear that their agenda was to improve me, rather than provide the fun and escapism that Enid Blyton gave me. My aunt, who was a missionary in Africa, gave me Christian adventure stories. Another person handed me a copy of The Incredible Journey and kept quizzing about it every time I saw them. The only people who didn't burden me with unwanted gifts were my parents.As a result, I have a horror of presents, particularly books and films. The moment somebody gives me a DVD or novel, I know that at some point in the future, I will be expected to tell them what I think of it.When I worked in a bookshop, customers would often ask me for a recommendation for a child who was starting to read. My reply was always the same: 'Give them a book token, then they can make their own choice.' Even if the child buys complete crap, it doesn't matter. They have bought their first book and they are now a reader. The rest will follow."},
{"title": "Sapphire", "date": "Sunday, August 16, 2009", "text": "I've just watched a film called Sapphire, directed by Basil Dearden in 1959. On the one hand, it's a typical police procedural 'B' movie, with square-jawed, two-dimensional detectives, negotiating their way through a gallery of stereotypes. On the other, this is a remarkable film that explores a side of British society that was generally ignored.The film opens with the body of a young woman being thrown on the ground. A jazzy soundtrack (played by the Johnny Dankworth Orchestra) establishes that this is going to be a gritty, hard-edged thriller. No poison pen letters or old ladies here.Unusually for a film of this type, it's shot in colour and gives a vivid portrait of London in the 1950s: a shabby, grey, depressed-looking city that still hasn't recovered from the Blitz. What a contrast with America in the 1950s.The Second World War effectively bankrupted Britain and it is striking how drab everything looks, from the clothing to the dull interiors. No wonder the Sixties happened.Sapphire begins conventionally enough, but after only ten minutes the film suddenly - and without any warning - changes gear and what begins as a typical murder mystery turns into a story about racial bigotry, with the shock revelation that Sapphire Robbins was 'coloured'!Filmed less than a year after the Notting Hill race riots, Sapphire is a brave attempt to depict the endemic racism in Britain towards the burgeoning West Indian community. Unfortunately, it is done in such a heavy-handed way that the film's agenda isn't always clear.Fifty years on, scenes like this can make uncomfortable viewing:'No matter how fair the skin, they can't hide that swing.'The implication that anyone with black ancestry, however distant, has an irresistable compulsion to tap their feet to the rhythm may be one of the many reasons why this film isn't on DVD.It's a shame, because I think that Dearden's heart is in the right place and he became well known for tackling controversial subjects.Two years later he filmed Victim, with Dirk Bogarde risking his career as a mantinée  idol to play a homosexual lawyer. Unfortunately Janet Green's screenplay for Sapphire is populated by stereotypes, not real people.Take this hilarious scene involving a female police sergeant: So there we have it. If you do a man's job, you must be a lesbian.We can laugh now, but if I was a woman in the 1950s I'd feel like throwing a brick at the screen, particularly when the detective says 'There's a good girl'.The sum of Sapphire is greater than its parts, thanks to the controversial subject matter and Basil Dearden's direction. Dearden's 1951 film Pool of London, which is the first post-Windrush film to feature an inter-racial romance, is now available on DVD. I hope that Sapphire will also be released in the near future."},

It's a lovely song and the singer - Googoosh - was the most successful Iranian singer of her time. In 1979, the new revolutionary government banned her from performing for 21 years. In 2000, she resumed her career with a series of sell-out concerts in America and Europe.I've no idea what the song's about, but she keeps saying 'Kushti' - a word that will be familiar to viewers of Only Fools and Horses.During the long orchestral introduction, Googoosh obviously feels a bit of a lemon and does that 'I'm not dancing but I'm not standing still either' swaying that singers often do while they're waiting for their cue. It's a great pity that the ayatollahs silenced her for so long."},
{"title": "Blistering Barnacles...", "date": "Tuesday, August 11, 2009", "text": "I've read some damning reviews in my time, but few have been bitchier than Hugo Barnacle's review of Adam Thirwell's new novel, The Escape, in the last issue of the Sunday Times.If I was Thirwell, I'd be pretty mortified.Perhaps he'll send Mr Barnacle an abusive email, a la Alain de Botton, who didn't take kindly to a bad review. De Botton was on last week's edition of Saturday Live on BBC Radio Four and was being gently teased for his outburst. To his credit, he admitted that he'd been very silly.One person who hasn't had to worry about bad reviews is MJ Hyland. I've just read her new novel This is How and was impressed by her stark, understated prose - a welcome relief from the dense, overwritten, peacock style of writers like Martin Amis. To call This is How accessible sounds a little too much like being damned by faint praise. However, Hyland's novel can be read either as a literary novel that betrays the influence of Camus and Dostoyevsky, or as a straightforward thriller.I think I'm going to be a big MJ Hyland fan.Unfortunately, that's the nearest I've come to any literary activity this week. My wife and children are away for two weeks, which should be a golden opportunity to catch up on all of the books and films I've been meaning to see, but instead I've spent most evenings in the garden, drinking beer and looking at the sky. Is that a bad thing?I watched a very enjoyable film yesterday called 36. It's just a cops and robbers movie with a reasonable amount of gratuitous violence, but because it's in French and stars Gérard Depardieu and Daniel Auteuil, my sins are all forgiven.Vive la France!"},

{"title": "New Towns", "date": "Monday, August 03, 2009", "text": "In June I wrote this post about a fairly hideous place called Mostecko. It is, or at least was, a new town development built in communist Czechoslovakia around 30 years ago. Unless you're a big fan of concrete, it's a pretty unappealling place. However, the authorities obviously regarded it as the apotheosis of their ideology and published a lavish photographic book, celebrating the creation of their socialist utopia.The post prompted several comments and the general consensus was that planned towns don't work. For a community to succeed, it has to grow organically over many generations, in response to the needs of its inhabitants, rather than the blinkered vision of social engineers and the greed of corporations.But is this really true? Edinburgh's 'New Town', built between 1765 and 1850 is a masterpiece of urban planning, as is Baron Haussmann's redevelopment of Paris during the reign of Louis Napoleon. Will Mostecko achieved belated acclaim in the 23rd century? I somehow doubt it.Last week, during a holiday in Dorset, I made a detour to visit Poundbury, a controversial new 'urban extension' of Dorchester. It is controversial because the driving force behind Poundbury is Prince Charles, the bette noire of modern architects. This is what I found:The idea behind Poundbury is to create a 'market town' environment with an ecclectic mix of architectural styles, but beneath its traditional trappings, this development has been heavily influenced by America's 'New Urbanism' movement, which promotes walkable, unzoned areas.It would be so easy to criticise Poundbury. Where are the people? I felt as if I was in an episode of The Prisoner. Also, it really goes against the grain to see any new building that has been designed by someone who has tried to pretend that the 20th century never existed.However, the fact remains that if I had to choose between living in Mostecko, Crawley, Milton Keynes, Basildon, Stevenage or Poundbury, I'd choose the latter without hesitation. Poundbury may be a pastiche (and if I lived there, I'd probably feel as if I was in The Truman Show), but the uncomfortable truth is that Prince Charles's vision of a people-centered urban space, built using traditional methods and designs, is far superior to any of Britain's postwar new towns."},
{"title": "Holiday Snaps", "date": "Saturday, August 01, 2009", "text": "I have just returned from a week's caravan holiday in Dorset. I don't think there's any need to go into further detail - it's one of those statements like 'I've just spent the last three months being held hostage in Iraq' or 'I'm going to have my left leg amputated' which requires no further comment.Here are some holiday snaps:This is the beach at Lyme Regis. The parents in this photo managed to sunbathe and spend ages chatting on their phones without any interuption from their children. The boy seemed content to either stare into space or watch his sister build a sandcastle. What's their secret?My sons are feral and the oldest one had to be rescued by the coastguard within an hour of arriving at the beach.Ever since I was a boy, I've looked forward to the days when I can play Crown Green bowls and sit in deck chairs at holiday resorts.This couple sat on the table behind us in a beachside restaurant. I love observing couples in restaurants, particularly unusual ones like these two. They sat largely in silence, but whether it was companionable or awkward I couldn't tell. The long tress of hair suggests that a day of wholesome hiking will be followed by an evening of violent lovemaking.In the great tattoo debate, I'm firmly on the non side and I'm afraid that I saw nothing to change my views. What might look sexy on a young woman in her early twenties, looks increasingly unapealling with age and weight.On Lyme Regis beach I found myself yearning for an impromptu raid from the Tehran Morality Police. There are only so many beer guts and varicose veins that a person can look at.The fossil-rich Dorset coastline is now a UN World Heritage site. Unfortunately, my son's idea of fossilling consists of hitting the cliff face as violently as possible with a large hammer.The origins of the 'Rude Man of Cerne Abbas' are uncertain. Is he a prehistoric fertility figure? Is his bellicose stance a warning to other tribes? There is no written reference to him before 1647 and it is possible that he is a 17th century joke.I found this 12th century effigy in the beautiful Lady St Mary's church in Wareham. He looks surprisingly cheerful for a dead medieval knight. The church is full of interesting features, including an 8th century Celtic inscription (see below) and a salmon-shaped weather vane.This replica of Thomas Hardy's study is a permanent exhibition at the excellent Dorset County Museum in Dorchester. With the possible exception of the Santa Barbera Museum of Art, this is the best small museum I've ever visited.The Museum concentrates on the county's archeological, geological and literary heritage, the latter of which includes features on Thomas Hardy, John Cowper Powys, Sylvia Townsend Warner, John Meade Falkner and the local dialect poet, William Barnes:The girt woak tree that's in the dell ! There's noo tree I do love so well; Vor times an' times when I wer young I there've a-climb'd, an' there've a-zwung, An' pick'd the eacorns green, a-shed In wrestlen storms from his broad head, An' down below's the cloty brook Where I did vish with line an' hook, An' beat, in playsome dips and zwims, The foamy stream, wi' white-skinn'd lim's.The Dorset dialect is virtually dead, but I once heard a teenage girl say 'Oi bain't' (I be not) to a baffled French exchange student. There may still be pockets of Dorset dialect in some of the remoter 'Squeak like a piggy' parts of the county, but it's unlikely. Even the lovely rural burr is dying out (for non-British readers, the traditional Dorset accent sounds a little like pirates - 'Ha-harr, me hearrties', etc).However, when the gentleman below was alive, the English language didn't even exist.This 4th century skull is one of many skeletons excavated from Dorset's hill forts. One is displayed lying as he was found, with his sword by his side, possibly after a skirmish with the Romans. I'm not sure how I'd feel ending up as a display in a 37th century museum.This is part of an 8th century fresco and serves as a reminder of how wonderful English churches must have been before the Reformation saw these craven images smashed up and painted over.This carving comes from four centuries later. I like the rouged cheeks.Like many small museums, although there were themed displays, there were also some quirky artifacts that the curactors had inherited from an earlier, more ecclectic age. I really enjoyed the displays of stuffed red squirrels and Victorian washing devices, but couldn't quite muster up the same enthusiasm for the farming implements.Museums like the British Museum or the Louvre are all well and good, but they are so vast that the visitor ends up feeling exhusted and drained within an hour. I prefer a good small museum any day.I didn't think my visit could get any better, but then I found this exhibition:A Ladybird exhibition, complete with original art work, jacket designs and activities to keep my children quiet. Bliss!I like Dorset. I probably liked it even more when I lived in London and the sight of rolling hills and blue seas was a rare treat, but I still feel excited when I see the Cobb at Lyme Regis. However, I will not be going there again for a few years.Whilst we were cowering behind a wind break on Charmouth beach last Tuesday, my wife and I concluded that unhappy parents are not good parents. My ideal holiday involves good weather, decent accommodation, nice food and a mixture of stimulation and relaxation. Our caravan holiday provided bad weather, plastic accommodation, a constipation-inducing diet of microwaveable ready meals and a mixture of anxiety and exhaustion.Britain may be back in favour as a holiday destination, but next year we shall be heading for sunnier climes."},

If my family start treating me with a modicum of respect, then I'll know that this is an 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' scenario.

{"title": "The Age of the Gentleman", "date": "Tuesday, July 21, 2009", "text": "I have now been in my new job for three months, although it feels much longer. I wouldn't presume to call myself an expert in antiquarian books, but it's amazing how much you can learn in a few weeks and I can now confidently throw certain titles into the skip without needing to check their value.I know that almost every gardening book published after 1900 is worthless. I also know that titles written by Arthur Mee, J.B.Priestly, Mazo de la Roche, Hugh Walpole, Frances Parkinson Keyes and Alec Waugh are two a penny.But even after I've removed all of the middlebrow 1930s novels, book club editions, reprints of the Pilgrim's Progess, sets of encyclopaedias and Reader's Digest publications, I'm still left with thousands of books. To confuse things further, I often find things that aren't books.Yesterday I found a superb 1928 catalogue from a department store specialising in gentlemen's clothes. I'd never heard of Welch, Margetson & Co, but apparently they were one of the leading companies of their kind, with eight banches in Great Britain, six in Australia and one each in Ireland, New Zealand and Canada, plus agents in every continent.The London branch had four floors, with whole departments for items like sock suspenders and umbrella handles. Here is a small selection of their wares:Before they became associated with old age and hospices, these dressing gowns were the height of sophistication.I'm quite fond of the yellow one, whilst my son prefers the Tom Bakeresque one in the upper middle.Try to ignore the 'Hitler on Ice' associations. After the bushy moustaches of the Edwardian era, these 'taches were the epitome of style. Hitler's popularity in post-Weimar Germany had nothing to do with his policies. People just loved his cool moustache.The Hitler moustache's popularity obviously waned somewhat after the Second World War (as did the name Adolf) and only the ghastly egotists General de Gaulle and Franco continued to wear them.What superb jackets! Stylish, well-cut and clearly good quality. I would pay good money to own any of them.It's strange how contemporary these designs look; to me, at least. I wasn't expecting to find such high quality colour illustrations in a catalogue from 81 years ago. I suppose that Welch, Margetson & Co could afford it, as their clientelle weren't hard up.I want to be one of these men, exchanging jovial banter over a postprandial glass of port whilst my chaufferer sits outside, rubbing his hands to keep warm. Actually, in reality I wouldn't be able to enjoy myself knowing that some poor bugger was freezing to death on my account. It's a flaw in my pretensions to be a gentleman.Ah, the sheer decadence of having to deliberate over the design and colour of a pair of slippers. How grim our sweatshop-made, utilitarian clothes look by comparison.The bathing suit is a pleasing alternative to the pot-bellied, tattooed, nipple-pierced British tourist in the Costa del Sol (and if a certain friend of mine is reading this - no, this isn't an oblique reference to you).I hope it goes without saying that I haven't forgotten the other side of the 1920s and 30s, as chronicled by Orwell and Steinbeck. Indeed, my family probably never set foot in Welch, Margetson & Co and if they had, I expect that they would have been ushered out.My grandfather was an unskilled labourer in the 1920s. He joined the army in the First World War before he'd had a chance to learn a trade and spent the rest of his life living on the breadline.One day he got a maintenance job with London Transport and had a slightly Chaplinesque accident with a ladder whilst walking through a tunnel. He fell on the electric line and suffered serious burns, but in those days the concept of sick leave was regarded as some mad, Bolshevik plot. He ended up having to take his two weeks' annual leave at Clacton-on-Sea, where his family relaxed on the beach whilst he was treated at the local burns unit.As I have said before, the recent past was a great time if you were rich, white, male and abled-bodied, but it could be fairly unforgiving to anyone who wasn't.The likes of Welch, Margetson & Co were for a certain type of person:I don't know exactly when they disappeared, but it looks as if a combination of Michael Caine, nylon and sweatshops were the cause of their demise. I wonder what my grandfather would have made of it all?"},
{"title": "Futurism at theTate", "date": "Sunday, July 19, 2009", "text": "I always avoid going to art exhibitions with friends.First, there's that whole dilemma about whether you should walk around together or not. Second, rather than dutifully look at each painting for 15 seconds, I prefer to spend minutes with the ones I like and ignore the rest, which makes me a bad gallery companion. Third, if I'm with a friend I haven't seen for a long time, we invariably start chatting and forget where we are.Yesterday, I broke my golden rule and visited the Tate Modern's Futurism exhibtion with two friends from university.I would like to pretend that we had a culturally enriching experience, but the truth is that whenever I meet up with these particular friends we seem to revert to the age of 18. I'm not complaining. Yesterday I laughed more than I have done for months, but next time we should just go straight to the pub.However, I did learn a few things about Futurism. The exhibition began, appropriately, with the Futurist Manifesto - a passionate, absurd declaration of war on 'decent society'. One of my friends particularly liked the phrase 'the broom of madness'. I wonder what the Futurists would have made of the Tate's revential exhibition, given their determination to 'destroy the museums, libraries, academies of every kind'.We did what we could to keep the spirit of Futurism alive at the exhibition and I hope that Marinetti would have been proud of us.As for the art, much of it left me cold, but there were a few works that really impressed:This photo doesn't do justice to the real painting, which had such vibrant colours that it almost appeared to be self-lit.I particularly liked Bursting Shell, by Richard Wynne Nevinson.This painting wasn't in the exhibition, but I like it so much I couldn't resist including it.I've no idea who painted most of the pictures. The best I could do was take photos of my favourites until the attendants told me off. I don't know why photography isn't allowed - I didn't have the flash on.The final exhibit was familiar, but I couldn't work out why:Then I remembered - my son's Star Wars 'Battle Droid' has neo-Futurist quailities:I left knowing slightly more about Futurism than I did when I entered, but not a lot."},

This week I've dealt with the library of a psychiatrist, a collection of books by Jewish writers and a some rather strange titles about Australia and New Zealand, all published in the 1880s. Here are two examples of the latter: I somehow doubt that the author was referring to the Aborigines.In the second example, the heathen Maoris are being given a good talking to by the Pioneer Bishop. The book contains some illustrations of grim-looking schools, built for the education of the natives.Although the books were very different from each other, they all shared an appalling attitude towards the indigenous population.This episode in British history is obviously highly regretable, but would you want to live in a world without Rolf Harris?** From a 2014 perspective the answer may be yes."},

The first - a discussion about Logical Positivism - made my brain hurt a little, but at least Melvyn Bragg made his guests explain what it was before assessing its impact.I find it much easier to listen to programmes like these in the car, as I'm not able to nod off. However I did find my attention wandering every time I saw normal, everyday things like pigeons, traffic light and roundabouts. My thoughts followed a depressingly familiar pattern: Wittgenstein...Cambridge...MAN IN SHORT TROUSERS...SEAGULL...Freddy Ayer...Language, Truth and BUS STOP...Moritz Schlick...Vienna...WAITROSE...To add to the distractions, my wife rang me in the middle to tell me that she was taking our youngest son to hospital, as he had his finger stuck in the letter G. At that point, I think I lost the plot, but I can still tell you what Logical Positivism is, which is more than I could do yesterday.The second podcast was an excellent Composer of the Week programme about Stravinsky in America and there was one particular anecdote which amused me.During his years in America, Stravinsky developed a great friendship with WH Auden, who wrote the libretto for his opera The Rake's Progress, but there was one aspect of the poet's behaviour that upset the composer and his wife. Apparently, Auden's personal hygiene was dreadful. His fingernails were black with dirt and he never used the towels and soap that were put out for him when he came to stay.Some years later, the Stravinskys were in New York, where Auden and his partner - Chester Kallman - invited them over for dinner. Vera Stravinsky was particularly dreading the meal and as she entered Auden's filthy flat, her worst fears were confirmed.After a few drinks, she reluctantly visited the loo and found a bowl on top of the cistern with a horrible brown object in it. Appalled, she quickly flushed it down the loo and return to the meal, trying to forget what she'd just seen.They all finished the main course and Chester Kallman proudly annouced that he'd made a chocolate pudding: 'I've been cooling it down in the bathroom...'WH Auden, whose wrinkled appearance once prompted the comment 'If that's what his face looks like, imagine his scrotum!'"},

I decided to test out a theory which claimed that you could tell how wealthy a country was by its stamps. The richest nations are supposed to have small, dull austere stamps whilst the really poor countries have beautiful, large, colourful panoramas.The results seemed to confirm the theory: Denmark - boring, USA - boring, France - boring, Rwanda - beautiful, Belgium - boring, Cameroon - beautiful...The collection seemed to be completely random until the penny eventually dropped and I noticed a recurring theme: space.The stamps mostly looked as if they'd been designed by the same person, with lots of earnest-looking astronauts, rockets blasting into space and satellites beaming propaganda into the living rooms of the civilised world. However, one nation bravely decided to buck the trend:Good old Equatorial Guinea. Their stamp commemorating the three dead cosmonauts of Soyuz 11 is in a class of its own. There can't be many stamps (if any) that feature corpses.I also noticed another set of stamps produced by Equatorial Guinea celebrating the success of the manned mission to Venus - something that has never happened and probably never will.Apparently stamps are quite a lucrative export for developing countries, so you have to admire the Equitorial Guinean Post Office for staying one step ahead of the space programme.

Perhaps they already are.But even worse than the news is the irritating, banal chat of the 'drivetime' presenters. Even Radio Three - once a glorious bastion of elitism  - now has a limerick competition during its morning programme. I do not want to listen to puns about Liszt written by someone who wears leather elbow patches on their tweed jacket and hasn't had sex for 37 years, if ever.Fortunately, the BBC now makes podcasts available of some of their best programmes and I no longer have to endure inane presenters and depressing news stories. I can now listen to clever people talking about fascinating subjects and by the time I get to work I feel invogorated.Here are five things I learned from last week's podcasts:Cancer drugs aren't expensive because of the research and development. They are simply priced at a level that 'the market will bear', according to Adam Wishart, who made a documentary about the ethics and economics of cancer treatment.Companies that bottle and sell spring water are, arguably, violating the United Nations article that defines drinking water as a human right, not a commodity.The BBC is working on a new project nicknamed Canvas that will incorporate digital and broadband services into a new, free service, available to all.John Bradshaw, the Chief Judge who tried King Charles I for treason, wore a hat with metal inside it to protect him in the event of an attack.Russell T Davis believes that the nature of writing for film and television is about to change significantly, as a new generation of writers are appearing who have grown up in the computer game era.Thank God for the podcast. I have been liberated. Here is a link to what is, arguably, the best podcast of all."},
{"title": "The Role of Women", "date": "Tuesday, June 30, 2009", "text": "Today I found some curious documents in a book published in 1947. Headed CLERICAL POSTS IN BRANCH \"B\" OF THE FOREIGN SERVICE, it gave details about joining the Civil Service.The starting salary for 'both boys and girls at age 16 or 17' was listed as £150 per year. I have no idea whether that was good or bad in those days, but I suspect the latter. The document then mentioned annual increments and I was appalled to see this:In the middle four grades, the highest salary a woman can earn is still less than the entry level for a man. How motivating, and yet that attitude would have seemed entirely reasonable in 1947. Even twenty years later, things hadn't changed that much. I remember my mother telling me that she was awarded a 'dowry' when she left the Civil Service to get married.On another piece of paper, I saw some details about the Civil Service Entrance Exam, which tested the literacy, numeracy and IQ of all applicants:Why did the examiners need to be aware of the exam candidate's gender? I can understand some sort of positive discrimination in favour of ex-servicemen, as many of them had an awful time when they returned to civilian life, but why identify women? What's even scarier is that the Civil Service was probably one of the more forward-thinking employers of the time.Harry Enfield's parodies of 1930s public information films are clearly humorous, but sometimes they are uncomfortably close to the truth:Of course it's all different now. Women are still frequently paid less, but nobody dares to put it in writing."},
{"title": "An important message from Ray Craft...", "date": "Saturday, June 27, 2009", "text": "I won't bore you with the reasons, but I've spent most of this week in a warehouse dealing with hundreds of boxes of books. It's the hardest I've ever worked. To make things worse, on Friday I was subjected to eight hours of Michael Jackson.This can't be right. I'm a white collar worker and have the cut-glass accent to prove it. I'm sure there isn't anything in my contract about this. On the plus side, at least the lads in the warehouse now call me 'mate'. I shall miss them when I'm back in the office.Out of the thousands of books that I looked at last week, I found a disappointingly small number of unusual bookmarks. Here are some of the more interesting ones:What is the meaning of this post-it note? I have no idea and wish that I could ask its former owner, a Mr T Bicker.No cycle clips? He'll get grease on those immaculately-pressed trousers.In the days when the word 'zany' wasn't used in a sneering, post-modern, ironic way, this man was regarded as the zaniest radio presenter of his time. Like Rock Hudson, Denholm Elliot and Jimmy Edwards, he was 'outed' in the most traumatic way of all.This piece of paper single-handedly solves the Mystery of the Garish Trays. Once they were ubiquitous. Now they're as rare as honest MPs.I'm proud to say that I achieved the lowest mark for Welsh in the history of the University of Wales. My college was in a Welsh-speaking area and as a goodwill gesture, I decided to learn the local language. It was a disaster.If you've ever wondered why people aren't addicted to drugs any more, here is the answer.It was all going terribly well until they mentioned the Excellent Toilet Facilities.Attention all colonials! Please send regular supplies of chocolate to the Mother Country (if you're in Canada, we will accept male syrup).And finally, the important message from Ray Craft...What events led to the suspension of the 'Bisquit Club'? I love notices like this because they refute all of those people who moan about the declining standards of English."},
{"title": "Rovering to Success", "date": "Thursday, June 25, 2009", "text": "My nine-year-old son has just had a sex education lesson at school and seems to be quite traumatised by the experience. I'm not surprised. I have vague childhood memories of watching a video of a baby being born and I can't say that I particularly enjoyed it. It's even worse for the girls, who now know what's in store for them if they want to have a family.Why are schools so intent on teaching young children about sex? I appreciate that the Government want to reduce the number of teenage pregnancies, but is scaring the hell out of small children the answer?When I was nine I had no interest in how babies were made and several days after seeing a sex education video, I forgot everything I'd seen. I spent another few years in blissful ignorance, convinced that I'd popped out of my mother's navel.Then adolescence arrived.Within days I seemed to go from not thinking about sex at all to being obsessed by it. I wanted to know what this big, grown-up secret was all about and used to sneak downstairs to watch Jean-Luc Goddard films on BBC2 (you can always rely on the French for superfluous nudity). I thought I was being discreet but my parents must have noticed because one day, my father handed me a book saying 'This helped me when I was your age.'The book was called 'Rovering to Success' and it was written by the founder of the Cub-Scout Movement, Lord Baden-Powell. The book was over 50 years old. I hated old things, but out of respect I started to flick through the chapters. This is what I saw:It came as no surprise to discover, some years later, that Baden-Powell's marriage was not a conventional one."},
{"title": "Another Day in Paradise...", "date": "Thursday, June 18, 2009", "text": "I found a rather enigmatic book of photographs yesterday. It was called Mostecko and was entirely in Czech, with no publication date. At first I couldn't see the point of the book, but I gradually realised that that it was about the building of a new town.The fashions clearly pointed to the late 1970s, but given that the setting was communist Czechoslovakia, it could have been as late as 1982. This was during a time when Czechoslovakia was one of the most hardline regimes in eastern Europe, so this book is not only a souvenir but also a work of propaganda.Although my Czech is a little poor, the layout of the photographs created a fairly straightforward visual narrative and the book seemed to be heralding Mostecko as some sort of socialist utopia. Here are a few examples:How nice to live somewhere where you can stand in the middle of the road without getting knocked down by a carMaking Polonium 210, to deal with the enemies of socialismThe bustling heart of the New Town districtThis man used to be Professor of Philosophy at Brno University, but following a slightly critical article he wrote about the 33rd Party Congress, he has been demoted to operating the sausage roll-making machine in MosteckoMostecko's residents had to wait years for their Skodas and they've already broken downDidn't the book's editors notice that the boy in the background is painting some sort of psychotic, Munchesque face? A special tram line built to take relatives to visit political prisoners in the nearby gulag'I am sorry comrade, but the Central Committee have decided that Dr Seuss is an imperialist lackey. Your daughter must only read books that are on the new list.'Perhaps I am doing Mostecko a disservice, but the overall effect is of a socialist Purgatory. Why is nobody smiling? The pictures may have been intended as propaganda, but they tell a different story.If I lived in the Mostecko of the 1980s, I think I'd have to develop a serious drinking problem to cope with the excitement of living there. I wonder what it's like today?Mostecko does have an Old Town district, which if this picture is anything to go by, isn't quite the bustling metropolis it might once have been:In fairness, there are some awful new towns in England and I'm told that the suburbs of Paris are an object lesson in how not to design a place for people to live. Why is it that planned towns are usually so vastly inferior to those that have evolved over time?"},

I have now found the perfect solution:This photo fell out of a 1930s copy of Peter and Wendy. As usual, there were no names or date, but the quality of the colour and hairstyles suggest the mid-1960s.Another utterly beautiful engraving from an utterly worthless children's book.This is part of a poem that fell out of a book on wildfowl.

It includes phrases like:'Madame, if I had that good fortune that my company should be unto you as agreeable to yours is to me, I should have attained the last period of my hopes.'Enchanting. You can almost forget the syphyllitic lotharios of reality, dodging emptied chamber pots in the more lugubrious parts of London.And for those of you who wish that you could be transported back in time to the England of Jane Austen, here's an extract I found from an 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue:Obviously one item needs no comment, but I'm also less than impressed by the 'jeering name for an ugly blind man.'We may live in the age of reality television, Hello magazine and 'collateral damage', but I still feel fortunate to be living in our vacuous, globally-warmed world, for all its faults."},

The word louche was invented for men like him.I've discovered a lot of children's books with beautiful engravings, like this one. The books are often worthless and it pains me to think that these images are destined for oblivion.The title page of a 1930s edition of the London Mercury - a magazine devoted to the fine arts - now sadly long defunct. This issue had some fine woodcuts, including the one below:I found a Victorian mongram album yesterday. I'd no idea what a mongram was, but it appears to be what we would now call a logo. The album contained hundreds of mongrams, including regiments, Oxbridge colleges, hotels, shipping companies and Government departments. The album managed to be both incredibly dull and extremely fascinating at the same time. Here is one of my favourites:An extract from a novel by my dad's favourite writer - Percy F Westerman. Dad's jingoistic attitudes used to exasperate me in my teens, but later I realised that his generation had been a little brainwashed. To quote my father's geography teacher: 'This is a map of the world. All the bits that are pink are British, and the rest don't matter.' My father's tragedy was that his world view was obsolescent before he'd even reached his mid-20s.An engraving from the 1953 Penrose Annual - a review of the graphic arts.This castle isn't part of the National Trust.Another illustration from the Penrose Annual.A typically maudlin, sentimental Victorian engraving.

I will never Twitter, but if it enabled me to easily share images with you the moment I saw them, I might be tempted."},
{"title": "Don't go there...", "date": "Sunday, June 07, 2009", "text": "Eleven years ago I was sitting in an aeroplane, 500 miles of the coast of Brazil, when there was a sudden jolt. Drinks were spilt and people laughed nervously. Just as the atmosphere was returning to normal, there was another jolt and the plane started to shake. The fasten seatbelts sign came on and the Argentinian pilot cheerfully announced that we had merely 'heet a leedle beet of tarrbulence'.I wasn't convinced. I had experienced turbulence before and this was somethinq quite different, but the cabin crew seemed to be taking it all in their stride so I returned to my book. However the turbulence got worse and I noticed that a deathly quiet had replaced the animated chatter of the plane's mostly South American passangers. Was this it? Were we going to plunge to a watery grave in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean? After the terrible events of last week, perhaps it wasn't such a ridiculous question.I have been scared of flying ever since and although I haven't completely succumbed to my phobia, I don't go out of my way to travel by plane. However, rationally I know full well that it isn't travelling to another country that's dangerous. The trouble really starts when you've arrived.Some people have the irritating ability to assimilate themselves effortlessly into new countries. By the end of the first day, they have a local bar. By the second, they've been invited for a meal, successfully bartered their way in the local market and climbed a nearby mountain. Their laidback bonhomie is the WD40 of social intercourse (and probably sexual, too).When I travel my trips are marked by a succession of minor mishaps and near-death encounters which, in most cases, don't even amount to a half-decent anecdote.I have been stalked by a mountain lion, had my car reduced to a small cube by a huge truck on an ill-fated trip to Bodega Bay (where Hitchcock filmed The Birds), dumped on a larva field in the middle of nowhere by a malevolent taxi driver and almost crushed under the wheels of a bus in Chile.All of these things happened because I was clueless about my surroundings. I arrived with my own preconceptions about how things worked and naively assumed that the British way of doing things was based on some universal law of common sense, rather than being a variation on a theme. Most of the time, this ignorance resulted in minor frustrations, but occasionally I made near-fatal errors.So flying isn't the problem. It's being abroad. I suppose I should take the hint and stay at home."},

{"title": "Bookshop Customers (No.2 in an occasional series): the Self-Help Reader", "date": "Tuesday, June 02, 2009", "text": "If you bought a washing machine that failed to clean your clothes, you would feel entirely justified in demanding a replacement or, at the very least, a repair. In today's consumer society, we expect products to work. When they don't, it is regarded as an aberration.However, these rules don't seem to apply to self-help books. I remember selling a one or two self-help books a week to the same woman for nearly three years. She must have bought over 200 books from me on a variety of subjects. She ran with the wolves, did the dance of anger, walked along the road less travelled and discovered that she was from Venus, but after two years she didn't seem any better for it.I had similar experiences in other bookshops. Women (for it was always women) would religiously (or irreligiously) buy one self-help book after another without displaying any discernible change. This seemed strange, given the books' grandiose claims. Normally, if you buy something that doesn't work, you don't make the same mistake again.The typical self-help customer hasn't been to university. They are in their mid-30s or older and have lived long enough to experience a creeping disillutionment with their lot. Perhaps their kids don't understand them and the young Adonis they married is now Homer Simpson. They have no intention of walking out, so their focus is on how to make life more bearable.Of course, it's entirely possible that I'm wrong. Perhaps these books were so effective that the customers simply wanted more, or maybe their angels told them. Either way, it sounds like money for old rope if you're a publisher and I'm amazed how successful self-help and MBS (Mind, Body and Spirit) books are.And why is it nearly always women who buy these books? My wife's theory is that it's because they live with men. I'm not quite sure how to take that."},
{"title": "Bookshop Customers No.1 (in an occasional series): The Science Fiction Reader", "date": "Sunday, May 31, 2009", "text": "People are very unkind about readers of science fiction and fantasy novels, portraying them as geeky virgins who still live with their parents. As a bookseller who has dealt with thousands of sci-fi fans over the years, I must protest at this crude generalisation. I have met at least seven science fiction readers who didn't conform to this stereotype.My main issue with the sci-fi/fantasy fans was their relentless questions about forthcoming books. Giving customers information about new titles is part of a bookseller's job, but the fantasy readers nearly always drove me to a state of desperation.'When's the next book in the Throngard saga coming out?' (We look books up by author and title, not saga and anyway, why are you asking me? Don't tell me you haven't spent ages looking at the author's website)'Can you phone around your branches to see if they have a signed hardback of Terry Mobble's Planet of Woodlice?' (Of course; I've got nothing else to do)'Is this any good?' (No of course it isn't, but it's got a map with a 'Western Sea' and some people with silly names and superfluous apostrophes - what more do you want?)I became very adept at spotting any potential sci-fi/fantasy enquiries and would quickly hide, leaving the less experienced members of staff to learn the hard way. I felt a guilty pleasure at overhearing them say 'Sorry, but how do you spell P'taneth Mhoordu? Is it one word or two?'"},
{"title": "Garden Leave", "date": "Saturday, May 30, 2009", "text": "'In the United Kingdom, Garden leave (or gardening leave) describes the practice whereby an employee who is leaving a job (having resigned or otherwise been terminated) is instructed to stay away from work during their notice period, while still remaining on the payroll.' - WikipediaWhat Wikipedia didn't mention was that Garden leave is usually only taken by senior management. Anyone lower down in the pecking order isn't considered worthy of such treatment and the terms of their departure are far less favourable.I officially left my last job on May 17th 2008, but actually hadn't done a day's work since December 15th 2007. I had decided to award myself Garden leave.Two years ago my garden looked as if it belonged to someone in an advanced state of psychosis. I  remember seeing a documentary about a man who slowly lost his mind and started hording things to the point where he was unable to find a way out of his house. At some point his plumbing broke and he started to defecate in his own garden. I was appalled, but little did I know that my garden would start to look quite similar:This isn't the garden at its worst. At this point the rats hadn't appeared, but it's pretty awful. I had just had some major building work take place and the garden had been used as a temporary dump. Left unattended for months, the garden quickly deteriorated into a post-apocalyptic landscape, rather like that town next to Chernobyl. It got so bad that I didn't see how I could ever have the time or energy to change things.Fortunately, my former employer did me a huge favour. They presented me with a wonderful opportunity to take Garden leave; literally. The moment I stopped work, I started digging and began with a Soviet-style scorched earth policy:I then set myself a budget of no more than £500. Was it possible to transform a garden for so little? I started by going to the local dump, where I was able to requisition paving stones and wood. This was followed by seeds and plants, none of which cost more than £5. Finally, I bought an Asda patio set for £95 and a play house for £130. Here is the finished result:It won't win any competitions, but it is a big improvement on the radioactive wasteland that preceeded it. I have gone for the 'cottage garden' look (i.e throwing handfuls of seeds on the ground and seeing what happens)I built the fence myself. I feel like a real man now.This is a stone I found on a beach when I was 17. It looks more like a sculpture.It's a small garden and a rather strange one, as it backs onto the upstairs bedroom. Lewes is built on a medieval grid of streets and in the Middle Ages, people tended to have courtyards rather than gardens (he wrote, not really knowing if it was true). But if I need space for my boys to run around, there are two huge fields within five minutes' walking distance, overlooked by Lewes Castle:It's not the perfect answer. My two sons would be happier living in the countryside, but as urban environments go, I can't think of many places that offer more than Lewes."},
{"title": "I'll never work in an office...", "date": "Thursday, May 28, 2009", "text": "For most of my working life, I have been adamant that I never wanted to work in an office. I worked in one briefly when I was a student and felt like a battery hen. I hated the pointless regulations, the lack of natural light, the obsession with air conditioning and the constant whinging and backbiting. In a moment of desperation, I set fire to a sign that said that the building was completely fireproof.Bookselling offered an escape. It was like an extension of university and, on the whole, a bullshit-free environment. I really appreciated the fact that there were so many different facets to the job, from the cerebral to the mundane. One minute I'd be talking to John Calder - Samuel Beckett's publisher - the next I'd be boxing-up a return of unsold stock.People wondered how I managed to survive on such an appalling wage, but I felt that it was a price worth paying for not having somebody mess with your head (man). But then Waterstone's bought Ottakar's and it felt as if the bullshitters had taken over. Books became 'product'. Manangers' meetings started to resemble Communist Party conferences in the Soviet Union, with people clapping nervously at ever banal utterance from the platform.The same thing was happening in publishing. The days of long, liquid lunches and golf on Friday were long gone, as the accountants moved in. I'm appalled to read that, according to today's news, publishing is the booziest industry in the UK, because today's publishers are a picture of sobriety compared to their predecessors. When I started in bookselling I used to hear tales from the 1960s that made me wonder how any books ever got published.I left bookselling feeling fairly certain that I'd never work with books again. I was also resigned to the depressing prospect of working in an office. But guess what? I was wrong.I love working in an office. I like the fact that somebody else is responsible for the minutiae of running a building: the health and safety regulations, the fire and security alarms and the cleaning. I love not having to worry about whether the staff are happy and motivated and it's absolute bliss not having to deal with the public. I don't even have to worry about the authors, because they're all dead. Fantastic!It's just me and the books."},

I quickly separated the wheat from the chaff and returned to the deathly quiet of my office.Sorting through the books I found some more bizarre and intriguing bookmarks. My favourite was this one, from a 1940s book:It reads a little like some sort of coded message between secret service agents, or possibly lovers. I'd love to know the background to this enigmatic note.A tiny newspaper cutting. Who decided that it was worth cutting out and why? The 1970s used to be called the decade that style forgot, but these women look great.Times change but the message stays the same: come here and you'll get laid. My parents took me to Butlins when I was 12 and it bore an uncanny resemblance to a prisoner of war camp. If I'd been there longer than one night, I'd have started digging tunnels.There is a wonderful book called Boring Postcards published by Phaidon and, worryingly, this image would probably be too interesting to warrant inclusion. However, it's still quite a dull scene and I wonder who decided that this view would make a good postcard.This is from a 'Code of Conduct' leaflet for bus drivers and conducters.

{"title": "It's a boy thing...", "date": "Sunday, May 17, 2009", "text": "For the last few weeks my son and I have been reading a superb trilogy of books by Paul Dowswell. Set during the Napoleonic era, they follow the adventures of a teenage boy who has been pressganged into the Royal Navy and although they are written for older children, Dowswell doesn't pull many punches when it comes to depicting the harsh realities of a sailor's life.There are even a few swear words, which my son naturally loves.I've always been fascinated by accounts of naval life. I'm not particularly interested in the actual vessels, but rather in the ship as a microcosm of society. Dowswell's books have taught my son a lot about life in the early 19th century and so far, he hasn't rumbled my hidden agenda of stealth history lessons.Paul Dowswell has now left the Napoleonic age behind and has just published a book about Jewish children in the Second World War. If it's as good as his other books, then I've no doubt that he'll start to receive the recognition he deserves.As Dowswell's last book in the series was partly set on board the HMS Victory during the Battle of Trafalgar, I thought I'd take my son to Portsmouth and have a look at the real thing:The Victory is a beautiful ship and in its time, a deadly one. However the real appeal for me lay in the more mundane facets of naval life: the sick bay, galley, purser's office, grain store and sleeping quarters. I tried to imagine what life would have been like with several hundred men on board. Smelly, noisy and exhausting I should think.I'm quite happy looking at something and letting my imagination wander - I can get the salient facts before or after the visit. However, whenever I stop and stare at something in an historic site, an attendant invariably siddles up to me and starts bombarding me with facts. I don't necessarily want to know how long something is, who built it and how it was restored. I want to know what impact it had on people's lives.Guided tours are even worse. I remember a visit to Versailles where a woman with breath that stank of stale Gitannes spent 10 minutes in each room (and there were many rooms) regaling us with endless facts about French aristocrats I'd never heard of. My abiding memory of the visit of intense boredom. I had just visited what was, in its time, the largest, most opulent palace in the world but failed to gain any sense of its scale. I would have been happier wandering around on my own.There are exceptions. The guided tours at Charleston - home of the Bloomsbury Group - are fascinating. I also remember an attendant at the Tate Gallery teaching me how to look at a Rothko painting, when I was a very ignorant and opiniated teenager.After exploring the HMS Victory we went to look at the hulk of the Mary Rose, the pride of Henry VIII's fleet. Over four centuries at the bottom of the sea have taken their toll, so the remains have been stored in a controlled environment where the timbers are constantly spayed with wax.Seen from the viewing gallery, the Mary Rose looks like something from Alien:The restoration of the Mary Rose is a big deal for a lot of people and I really tried to find it exciting, but after the HMS Victory it just looked like a lot of wood, and not very interesting wood at that. Nevertheless I was impressed by the objects that have been salvaged from the wreckage: musical instruments, a backgammon board, beautiful pewter plates and a variety of surgical instruments that are remarkably advanced for their time.After leaving the 'Historic Royal Naval Dockyard' we wandered around Portsmouth, which is a truly dreadful place.Portsmouth was heavily bombed during the Second World War, but I wonder how much of the modern townscape is the result of the Luftwaffe? I suspect that town planners from the 1950s-70s are also culpable for the concrete nightmare of modern-day Portsmouth.Recently, the local authority has tried to rejuvenate the town with some 'iconic' 'landmark' developments, but they just look incongruous:What Portsmouth needs is better housing, proper cycle lanes, more green spaces and an attractive waterfront along the lines of the South Street Seaport in New York (minus some of the tackier aspects). That would be a start."},

The key question is...'Where's the action and how do I get in on it?' Simply fab.\"Getting in on the action seems to involves finding the 'scene' and if that sounds as elusive as Tarkovsky's 'zone', you're quite wrong. There's even a map, showing visitors the grooviest boutiques, discotheques, casinos and, rather intriguingly, auction houses:Beyond its banal exterior, this is actually a well-written and informative guide to London and it gives a fascinating glimpse of a city that was undergoing a huge social transformation. I'm not sure about the author's credentials when it comes to Swinging London though; she looks far too sensible:Can you see her smoking 'pot' whilst listening to Within You Without You? I can't.My favourite part of the book is a map of Britain for foreign swingers. It is a masterpiece of economy:I say Britain, but anywhere north of Liverpool is deemed terra incognita. London is where it's at.It's interesting how the myth has replaced the reality and to anyone under 50, the term 60s London conjures up a groovy, Austin Powers-style montage of mini skirts and kaftans. However, whenever I watch documentary films from the period, I'm struck by the conservatism of the clothes and the depressed look of many streets, which still bore the scars of the Blitz.If there was a scene, I'm not surprised that you needed a guidebook to find it."},

I can't believe that someone is actually paying me to sift through boxes of secondhand books.The books arrive in plastic totes (when did the word tote appear on the scene? What's wrong with box or crate?) and each one usually has at least one book that is worth selling. In the last ten days I have found first editions of novels by Dickens, Maria Edgeworth, Hemingway and Roald Dahl, plus some really strange textbooks that have turned out to be worth hundreds of pounds. I now have to find the most effective way of selling them.Discovering what is valuable and what isn't has been a fascinating experience. Why is a first edition of Nevil Shute's On the Beach or TS Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral worthless, whilst a sixth edition of a textbook on radar can fetch £60? I know that the answer is supply and demand and that technical books have small print runs, but surely there is more demand for Eliot?Perhaps the least popular genre is poetry. I would have expected an 1868 collection of poems by Tennyson to be worth a few quid, but you can buy books like this for a fiver. Even more modern poets don't fare that well, with a first edition of Lawrence Durrell's collected poems selling for around £4.The Victorians seem to have lovd their poetry, but there was one thing they liked even more: The Pilgrim's Progress. I have never seen so many copies in my life, all of them worthless. They will be recycled into something more useful, as will the numerous book club editions that literally aren't worth the paper they're printed on.I had been afraid that after a year of leisure I would have trouble reacclimatising myself to the world of work.

I have spent the last few days sifting through thousands of old books and it's remarkable how so many of the jacket designs of the 1960s were obsessed with sex.The 1950s covers have pouting women with pneumatic breasts, gazing longingly at a rugged hero, but they seem comparatively chaste. The sixties jackets leave far less to the imagination.Here are a few examples:It starts innocently enough with a snog in a sportscar, but then things progress quickly...Although the girl is almost naked, the man is scratching his head in a perplexed manner. He's so 1950s. Eventually he gets the message and a tryst in a beach-hut cements their relationship. Naturally, they get engaged...A wedding takes place. The dress is made entirely out of artificial fibres, which almost ignite as the evening progresses. The happy couple move into a new townhouse, complete with driveway and garage.Married life begins well. A combination of valium and alcohol help to distract Daisy from the utter futility of her existence, but she still craves excitement. When some new people move into their modern cul-de-sac, life becomes more interesting...Daisy is soon 'in the club' in more ways than one, but who is the father?It is fascinating to witness the sexual revolution of the 1960s through contemporary book jackets, but it's equally interesting to see the growing backlash of the following decade. At first, the 1970s seemed like the über-sixties, but by the end the nipples were back in unburned bras and the world was run by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher."},

A book caught my eye and I started to flick through it. Suddenly, halfway through the book, a photograph fell out and floated down to the floor. I picked it up and to my horror, it was of me.My heart started pounding and I quickly put the book back, making sure that I kept the photo. I went outside and took deep breaths. Only later did I realise that I had borrowed the book a year earlier and used a photo as a bookmark.I mention this because I have spent today flicking through dozens of secondhand books and found several photos that were used as bookmarks. This one is my favourite:We're used to seeing individual passport photos of people, but there is something terribly private about a sequence, where we can see the subject trying to strike the right pose, experimenting with different moods. The man above appears both ridiculous and touchingly vulnerable.This young woman clearly isn't comfortable having her picture taken and is nervously biting her lower lip. Is she still alive today, I wonder?This bookmark is dated 1959 on the other side. It is only a fragment, but there is enough to see that it is an advert for the Albanian dictator Enver Hoxha's favourite film star, Norman Wisdom.On this scrap of paper, someone has gone to the effort of copying out the last paragraph of a  novel just below the actual text. Here is the only real bookmark I found all day, imploring the British to use their new National Health Service - TOWARDS A FITTER BRITAIN.

She is a 79-year-old pensioner who has very different ideas to me and I suspect that I am something of an enigma to her, however she is pleased that I have a 'nice speaking voice'.It would be easy for me to sneer at her kitsch loo-roll holder with a doll on the top and her views about the 'coloureds', but she is a product of her time. She had a hard life and although she achieved one of the best Eleven Plus results in the borough, my mother never had the benefit of a good education.  Since the days of my judgemental teens, I have learned to bite my tongue.Also, if I'd lived my mum's life, I wouldn't have lasted five minutes.She had me relatively late in life and there were times when I wished that my parents weren't so old. However, these days I feel fortunate to be able to listen to mother's accounts of growing up in the 1930s and her experiences of life in the Blitz.I asked my mother to write down her childhood memories and initially she didn't seem too keen on the idea, but a few weeks later a letter arrived in the post containing several pages of spidery handwriting.Here are a few extracts:'We lived in a top floor flat and it was a squash. I was the youngest of four. We three girls were in a double bed in Mum and Dad's room. They had to sleep in a 3' 6\" bed in the box room, so small you could just get a chest of drawers, a small chair and the bed in. My brother slept in the room only used for Christmas and company. There was no bathroom, so the tin bath came out every Friday night and we washed, checked our hair for fleas and had a dose of syrup of figs to clear the system. Our kitchen was tiny, but we lived in this room.During the War we all had shelters and every night, for many nights, we had to get out of bed as the siren went and we'd hear the bombs dropping. The 'all-clear' would sound at about 6am and we'd go up to bed for a short sleep before going to school.One night a bomb dropped on the railway line just yards away and we were woken up to get out of our houses immediately and get to a church hall at the end of the road. There were about 160 of us. We sat there all night and they came round with bread and marge in the morning. We went to my grandma's the next night. She wasn't very pleased, but there was nowhere else to go.When the area was declared safe, a collection was made for the men who defused the bomb. It came to £2, which didn't seem much for the men who had saved our lives. These men were never recognised for their bravery.One morning we went to school and found that my sister's best friend - Stella Danby - was killed with her mother and sisters. The father and little boy survived. My sister was inconsolable. It wasn't unusual to arrive in the classroom and see an empty desk.We had our fair share of bombs and one night the local graveyard was hit. The next day we collected shrapnel and bits of tombstones as souvenirs. My mother was very religious and when she found my collection I was punished severely.I didn't enjoy school. During the war there was a shortage of teachers and some old maids who had started when Queen Victoria was on the throne were bought out of retirement. They were very severe. Also, when the sirens kept going off, everything had to stop. My sister was in the middle of an exam and had to continue in the shelter. Food was rationed during the War. We could not get fruit and vegetables were scarce. I was always hungry. We used to love the tins of Spam that came from America. It wasn't like the Spam they have today.We had a prisoner of war camp for Italians near us. When Italy joined our side the prisoners were free to come and go as they pleased. Quite soon, there were a lot of dark haired babies being born. I remember my aunt looking at a baby and saying \"You can tell 'es an Eytie - eyes as black as sloes\".'Last year I read a fascinating book called London at War. I was particularly struck by people's accounts of how hungry they were and how their malnourishment made them vulnerable to colds and flu. Did this tally with my mother's memories? She had never mentioned being terribly hungry. I phoned Mum and she seemed surprised by the question: of course she was always hungry. If she hadn't mentioned the hunger, that was because there was nothing extraordinary about it.Hopefully, my mother may live for another ten or fifteen years, but just because she's relatively healthy at the moment, I'm not going to take her for granted. Over the years she has told me a lot of stories and I'm going to make sure that they aren't forgotten."},
{"title": "Freud Ego", "date": "Friday, April 17, 2009", "text": "I was sorry to read that Sir Clement Freud has just died. I always enjoyed listening to his lugubrious voice and dry, acerbic wit. His autobiography, Freud Ego, is one of the most enjoyable memoirs I've read.One of my favourite anecdotes from the book is from Freud's National Service days in the Royal Army, when Freud laboured under the misapprehension that a Private Young was actually Private Jung. It's a slight anecdote, but Freud makes the most of it and the soldier's baffled response to Freud's quip about the likelihood of having a Freud and a Jung in the same platoon is priceless.To Freud's credit (and to the reader's frustration), he barely mentions his grandfather. Sigmund Freud is remembered fondly as a grandfather who never forgot Clement's birthday, but there are no earth-shattering anecdotes. Clement Freud lived a remarkable enough life without having to trade on his family connections.Naturally, Freud Ego is out of print (although an optimistic dealer is selling a copy on Amazon for the eccentric price of £143.54). However, I wouldn't be too surprised if there is a reprint."},

{"title": "Last Thursday in Rye...", "date": "Saturday, April 11, 2009", "text": "Some towns announce themselves with huge signs which inform the visitor that an illustrious historical figure used to live there. Crowborough - a dull,  uninteresting town in Sussex - boasts that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle lived there for 22 years, whilst in Worthing there is a blue plaque commemorating the place where Oscar Wilde wrote The Importance of Being Earnest (although the original building has been replaced by an outstanding ugly block of flats).Rye doesn't need bother with any of this. Although it only has a population of 4,000, it has been home to more writers and artists than most cities I can think of. Every time I visit the town I find something new:Radclyffe Hall's door knockerI started reading The Well of Loneliness once, but for all its importance as a seminal work of lesbian fiction, it was incredibly dull.Victorian post boxTudor townhouseI also discovered that one of my favourite artists - Paul Nash - lived in Rye for a while. Like Eric Ravilious, he manages to capture the essence of the southern English landscape without reducing it to twee, sentimental, postcard scenes.However, perhaps his greatest work comes from Nash's work as an official war artist during the Second World War:Totes Meer (Dead Sea) is an incredibly powerful painting and when I first saw it in the Tate Gallery at the age of 17, I was blown away. I knew nothing about art and only went to the Tate because a friend suggested it. I was expecting to be bored by old masters and incomprehensible abstracts. How wrong I was.It's frustrating to learn how many paintings are stored away in the basement of the Tate Britain. The situation has obviously improved since the opening of the Tate Modern, but surely every work should be made accessible to the public.How about a Lewes Tate? With shops closing every week and the county council threatening to move their headquarters, Lewes could do with a new attraction. We've just been included in the new South Downs National Park, which is fantastic news for the town. However, I doubt whether this will bring many tourists and daytrippers to Lewes. We need a world class art gallery.We have a very good rail  connection:It's a winner. I shall write to Sir Nicholas this very moment."},

I received the good news this morning and although I should feel elated, the whole thing feels quite unreal because the job is almost too good to be true.I will be working with an internet bookseller, setting up a project to ensure that charities are not losing revenue from failing to identify rare and collectible titles that have been donated to their shops. In other words, I will be selling books for an ethical, carbon neutral company and raising money for charity.There must be a catch somewhere.After a year of being unemployed, this is a huge relief. When I walked out of Waterstone's I always hoped that I would find a better job reasonably quickly, but there was the nagging doubt that I might never find a decent job again. Suppose I was just crap? Maybe I'd never work again.The financial hardships of being unemployed shouldn't be underestimated, but I agree with some recent research that was discussed on Radio Four a few weeks ago, which concluded that 80% of the stress of losing a job stemmed from the loss of status and sense of purpose. No matter what you have achieved in your working life, unless you have inexhaustible reserves of self-esteem, unemployment is an extremely demoralising experience. It is remarkable how quickly you can lose your confidence.I tried to keep busy. In addition to having two young sons to preoccupy me, I did voluntary work as a magistrate and enrolled on a web-design course. These things helped, but none of them provided me with an answer to the dreaded question: 'What do you do?'. I felt a latent sense of guilt and shame, even though I knew it was irrational. I had paid taxes for years and was entitled to a state benefits, but I still felt uncomfortable about being one of the people who was taking.Being unemployed was better than working for Waterstone's, but it was a Faustian pact that would have eventually ended in tears. If you are unemployed, the Government give you just about enough money to pay the bills and feed yourself, but no more. It is the death of hope.Unfortunately, some people are so traumatised by their experiences of work that they would rather live in poverty than risk endangering their mental health. During the last year I met several who were intelligent and capable,  but had been broken by their experiences. The Daily Mail would have labelled them 'dole scroungers', but they were courageous individuals who had been through the most awful experiences.I met one young woman who had lived more in her 22 years than most people had in their entire lives. At the age of 14 she suffered from brain encephalitis and lost most of her motor functions. She had to relearn speech and at the age of 16, had the IQ of a ten-year-old. In spite of this she was sent to a tertiary college where she entered into a relationship with a man who abused her repeatedly. She eventually developed a pyschotic illness and was hospitalised for a long time.I met her at a course that was designed to help people find work and was struck by her intelligence, humour and lack of self-pity. I have no doubt that she will find a job, but I met others who were, frankly, no-hopers. One woman was even sacked from an unpaid, voluntary job. I could see why, but on closer acquaintance she emerged as an unusual, interesting person. I couldn't help feeling that her inability to find work was an indictment of modern society which, for all its equal rights legislation and inclusivity, is less tolerant in some ways.I have learned many things during the past year and feel richer for it, but I am extremely relieved to be back in work. More importantly, it is a job with huge potential and I think I will really enjoy it. It will be hard work, but exhilarating. Imagine: I'll spend every day rumaging through thousands of books looking for gold. Paradise."},

Stalin wouldn't have worried about that and neither should we. Why not send a mission of very old people? Think of the benefits. A low gravity environment would provide instant relief from arthritis and rheumatism. Also, if you felt that your life had largely been an unremarkable one, here would be an opportunity to achieve last-minute fame.  This wouldn't be a suicide mission as such. The aim would always be the safe return of the geriatric astronauts, but if this high-risk mission did fail there wouldn't be the same devastating shock to morale.

So many of my fellow bloggers have started Tweeting that I feel I must be missing something. Is it the Haiku of blogging?My objections are threefold. First, I hate the idea of being almost permanently connected to the internet wherever I go. That seems only a few steps away from having a chip inserted in the cerebral cortex and saying 'We are the Borg.' Second, isn't it just an upmarket version of texting? I loathe texting with a passion and whenever I receive a message, I'll phone the sender rather than spend an eternity typing a reply. Third, I don't want to know about the minutiae of someone's daily life.For example, yesterday Scott Pack shared this little piece of information with the world:'Think I might get an ice cream on the walk home along the river'.Perhaps Oscar Wilde would have been a good Tweeter, but who knows, even he may have run out of aphorisms and found himself forced to tell us what Bosie had for lunch.However I may be completely missing the point. Today, many of us no longer enjoy the feeling of communion with either God or our fellow neighbours and as the egocentricity of youth fades, the sense of isolation increases. Is Twitter a comfort blanket?Let's go back to Scott Pack spending half a minute typing his ice cream message. I can imagine that there is a pleasure to be derived from sharing this experience with an unknown number of friends and strangers around the world. I certainly enjoy the sense of community that comes with blogging and get excited when I realise that my words have been read by someone in Mongolia (even if they were really just after an image). Is Tweeting any different?Therfore, in the spirit of Twitter, I am going to tweet about my morning:There is a crack in the kitchen sink and the dishwasher's broken. The washing-up is in a tottering pile. Should I buy paper plates or fix it?Have just bought some silicon sealant. Pretty girl in Homebase. Got sealant on my skin by accident. Am I now sealed?Sink still leaking. Why?Noise outside of metal scraping and man running and shouting furiously.

So much for Mr Muscle. Feeling very manly.Still leaking. Feeling less manly.Looking for a plumber in the Yellow pages.That is probably the nearest I'll ever get to Twittering, but it still holds a strange fascination for me, so I am prepared to eat my words.P.S - I forgot to mention the new Twitter phenomenon, which was reported in the weekend papers - celebrities employing people to Tweet on their behalf.

Philip Chawner and his wife Audrey both weigh 24st and neither of them have worked for 11 years due to obesity-related health problems.

Not a fortune, but not bad either.However Mr Chawner complains that £22,500 'barely covers the bills and puts food on the table. It's not our fault we can't work. We deserve more.' Mrs Chawner agrees: 'All that healthy food, like fruit and veg, is too expensive. We're fat because it's in our genes.

Mulisch's mother, however, was Jewish.Mulisch once joked that he was the Second World War and in many respects, The Assault is the work of a writer trying to reconcile himself with his mixed inheritance. Set between 1945 and 1981, this novel manages to say an awful lot in its 180-odd pages. I hope that this European classic doesn't disappear into the ether of obscure fiction in translation.This is the third great novel I've read by a Dutch writer in as many months and yet Holland hasn't exactly set the literary world on fire. Why is this? There are many possible answers, but none of them are entirely satisfactory and if you apply the same criteria to other countries (weighting the results according to population and number of people speaking the relevant language) the results vary wildly.Why has the Czech Republic produced so many world-class writers compared to Poland, Switzerland or Finland, for example? Why have France and Russia contributed more to world literature than Germany and Italy?If you take the English-speaking world, although every relevant nation has produced a good crop of writers, for some reason Ireland and Canada are head and shoulders above everyone else. The number of great Irish writers is particularly impressive when you consider that Ireland's population is 2% of the USA total.But I'm rambling. My point is this: is there a thriving literary tradition in Holland waiting for an enlightened Anglophone publisher to share it with an English-speaking audience, or are Harry Mulisch and W.F.Hermans big fish in a very small stream?If Antal Szerb's wonderful Journey by Moonlight could be regarded as a classic of Hungarian literature for 60 years before anyone bothered to translate it, then that would suggest that we have a lot to look forward to."},
{"title": "The Nice and the Good", "date": "Sunday, March 22, 2009", "text": "Last Christmas my wife bought our three-year-old son one of the most ingeniously evil products of the 21st century. At first glance it looks like an innocuous DVD compilation of television programmes for toddlers. However - and this is the evil bit - it has a special feature that enables the DVD to play an endless selection of random episodes.Who could possibly want this feature? Crack addicts? Kidnappers?I feel bad enough when I realise that I've left my children watching television for three hours. It's so easy to do, particularly when you have so many important things to do. Like blogging.I feel particularly guilty when my sons start to plead with me to turn the television off and as an act of atonement, I invariably end up taking them somewhere wholesome like a nature reserve or historic building. Then, for a couple of hours, we can pretend that we are a perfect family and I am giving them an idyllic childhood.I blame the weather. The English winter is usually a miserable time of year, with short, dark, damp days that don't lend themselves to going outdoors. It's only four months long, but that's enough time to go stir crazy with two boys who, like dogs, need to taken out for exercise every day. We always aim to do that, but on cold, rainy days the temptation to put on the television is hard to resist.My oldest son is obsessed with watching movies. That's actually a very good thing, as it's meant that I've been able to introduce him to films like A Matter of Life and Death, North by Northwest and Planet of the Apes. However, he can't watch these in front of his young brother, so they usually end up watching CBeebies.In many ways CBeebies is very good. There are no adverts and the programmes, nearly all of which are home-grown, aim to educate as well as entertain pre-school children. However it is so nauseatingly nice and goody-goody.I don't normally agree with A.A.Gill, but I couldn't help smiling when he wrote, in his usual provocative way that:'As far as I can tell, which isn't very far, all children's television is policed by committees of single-parent lesbians, nursery assistants, social workers, outreach-policy face communicators and possibly Esther Rantzen. Everything is made to inculcate simple, short messages about honesty, kindness, inclusivity, cosiness and the sensible eating of organic, unprocessed food.'I'm hard to please. I would be the first to moan if CBeebies wasn't like this, but there is something nauseating about the way it is handled. Gill continues:'I'm all for moral television. But kids TV now isn't about good and evil. It's about constructing  the image of a world where there is no evil at all, no sharp edges, nothing but cute lessons without blame, a bland conformity and lots of hugs.   By chance I caught a Tom and Jerry cartoon this week and by comparison it was astonishing. It seemed so fabulously anarchic and naughty, a world made up entirely of danger and death. And it was so funny.'Perhaps that is the problem. CBeebies is never funny. It never dares to appeal to the dark side of little children - the part of their brain that thinks it's hilarious to hit others on the head with a shoe or stamp on a small creature. CBeebies is stage one in a programme to raise a generation of balanced, empathic and unprejudiced  adults, but will it have the opposite effect?It's good to see that organizations like the BBC are trying to be forward-thinking and make programmes that aren't always dominated by white, middle-class people, but do they have to do it in such a cackhanded way?Take Balamory, for example. For the uninitiated, this is a programme for toddlers set in a small village on a Scottish island. I don't know that much about Hebridean fishing villages, but I would imagine that they don't have huge ethnic minorities. However, Balmory is a multi-cultural community informed by mutual respect and inclusivity:That's a good thing isn't it? So why do I feel so nauseated by Balamory's anodyne vision?I think it's because I can sense people ticking boxes. The programmes may no longer feature an almost entirely white, middle-class cast (with a token loveable/criminal working class character), but the people making these programmes are mainly graduates from nice backgrounds and they seem to have rather crude approach to casting that smacks of tokenism.My younger son hates Balamory. He say's it's boring, but can't tell me why. I suspect that it's not silly or funny enough to engage him. His favourite series is the Wiggles - an Australian programme featuring four men who like they've been made redundant from Star Trek:After listening to 'Wiggly Party' for the 53rd time (and I'm not exagerating for dramatic effect), the music tends to grow on you and I have become a bit of a Wiggles fan myself.I like the Wiggles because it's very good at what it does - entertaining small children - and doesn't try to  educate or preach. The songs are catchy and, most of all, it's nice to see men of my age (who have been ethnically cleansed from British children's television) jumping up and down without doing their backs in:Karl Malden is 97 today. I had no idea that he was still alive and was even more surprised to discover that last year, he celebrated his 70th wedding anniversary."},

In those days the British navy was the largest in the world and the review at Spithead was a great spectacle. The BBC decided that they needed an expert to convey the full splendour of this event to a radio audience and decided to give the job to Lt Commander Tommy Woodroffe.Unfortunately, as you will hear, he was pissed out of his head:Lt Commander Woodroffe's broadcast certainly created a stir, but fortunately the BBC had a sense of humour and he was only suspended for a week. A year later he was commentating on football matches and during one game, which was 29 minutes into extra time, he commented 'If there's a goal scored now, I'll eat my hat.' A few seconds later, someone scored.To Tommy Woodroffe's credit, he did eat his hat."},
{"title": "It is better to travel...", "date": "Monday, March 16, 2009", "text": "Doctor Johnson famously quipped that the Giant's Causeway was 'worth seeing, but not worth going to see.' I was reminded of this quote last week as I spent around five hours in my car for a one hour guided tour of Dover Castle's secret war tunnels.Perhaps it was my fault. I had decided to drive along a road signposted as the Tourist Coastal Route. This involved crawling at 30mph behind a variety of slow vehicles. Some of the bigger ones had flashing lights and warning signs to let me know that they wouldn't be breaking the sound barrier, but the old age pensioners had adopted a more stealthy approach, shooting out of side roads at a breakneck speed before settling down to a steady 27mph.As for the 'Tourist Coastal Route', although I wasn't expecting the Pacific Highway, I had hoped for a little more than a concrete sea wall, badly-built bungalows and half-empty retail parks. It was hard to believe that my parents had once gone for a week's holiday in such a desolate place.Dover is the sort of place you pass through rather than visit. However it does have two tourist attactions. The first is a 3,600 year-old boat from the Bronze age which, unfortunately, just looks like a large bit of driftwood. The second is Dover Castle which, in addition to a collection of buildings from different periods, boasts a four-mile complex of secret tunnels built right into the famous white cliffs.The tunnels were started during the Napoleonic wars, but the bulk of them were built before and during the Second World War and were used as both a hospital and an operational headquarters. As France is only 21 miles away across a narrow, shallow channel of water, they had a vital strategic importance.They say that on a clear day you can see France. All I saw was a plain white sky with the hazy outlines of distant tankers:The Germans continually shelled Dover and this part of the coast was known as 'Hellfire corner'. Fortunately the tunnels were completely protected and in rooms like this, Vice-Admiral Ramsay's team plotted the successful evacuation of 380,000 British soldiers from Dunkirk:Apparently, women were allowed to wear trousers in this room because they had to do a lot of bending over (all in the line of duty, of course).I enjoyed seeing the war tunnels, but were they worth spending most of the day driving to? Perhaps they would have been if I had discovered them by accident, but impressive as they were, the tunnels were exactly what I expected. The real joy of travel lies in serendipity.Perhaps this is why the real highlight of the day was a 12th century church that I knew nothing about and visited on impulse. On the outside it was a fairly average medieval church, surrounded by fields of indifferent sheep and lichen-covered gravestones. However, inside it was unlike any church I've ever seen:Apparently the pews were painted pink by the Disney Corporation, who used the church as a location for their film Dr Syn. You would imagine that the parishioners took a dim view of having their church painted pink, but they loved it and the colour scheme has remained.In St Clement's there is a small annex, hidden behind a thick velvet curtain. A sign warns that it is dangerous to try and climb the stairs and my first reaction was to decry it as yet another example of our obsession with health and safety. However, in this case I agree:Centuries of woodworm have rendered these beams almost unusable and the bell tower is now silent.I was in St Clement's for at least half an hour and wasn't disturbed once. I would rather be alone in an obscure rural church than join a guided tour in a 'heritage' sight, where visitors are processed and have little or no time for reflection.I was quite awestruck to have an 800-year-old building all to myself. However, Dover Castle can easily put St Clement's into the shade:This is the Pharos - a Roman lighthouse that is 2000 years old. I had no idea that a building like this existed in Britain and I find it utterly bizarre that it is a relatively minor part of Dover Castle's collection. I naively thought that historical sites were all about going 'Ooh' and 'Ahh' at how old things were. Apparently not. Perhaps the Pharos just isn't sexy enough.Next week I think I'll cut out the destination part of the journey and just drive. It really is better to travel than arrive (unless you're flying Ryanair)."},

I'm afraid to say that today's visit only confirmed my views.

{"title": "The best of times, the worst of times...", "date": "Wednesday, March 11, 2009", "text": "The spring of 2005 was one of the best and worst times of my life. On the one hand I was opening a new branch of Ottakar's - only two minutes' walk from the beach - and had recruited a wonderful team of staff. On the other, my father was slowly dying in hospital and several times a week, I had to drive 150 miles to visit him.The combination of a dying parent and a heavy workload was a recipe for disaster and when, in the middle of it all, my wife discovered she was pregnant and started to feel really ill, I could have felt overwhelmed by events. However, it was work that saved me. By keeping busy and focusing on opening my new bookshop, I managed to stay sane.It might seem counter-intuitive to repress grief, but it worked for me. In the short-term, at least.There was something special about the shop in Worthing. There was an incredibly good morale and even though the age gap between the oldest and youngest member of staff was 48 years, it didn't stop us all having a good time at the pub.When we opened, we had less than a month to prepare for the launch of the sixth Harry Potter novel. We were busy enough just trying to get the shop running smoothly, but a new Harry Potter book was too good an opportunity to miss, as a successful launch would really put our shop on the map.I say 'our shop' because I think everyone felt a sense of ownership. I certainly did everything I could to encourage that view and it paid dividends. In the four weeks between opening the shop and the publication of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, everyone worked at a feverish pace to prepare for the launch. As a result, the evening was a triumph.If you wonder why I'm writing about something that happened four years ago, it's because I've just discovered how to convert the video I made of the launch into a format that can be uploaded to YouTube.I hope this film captures something of the fun we had at Ottakar's. One of the booksellers used to be a drama teacher and was in his element as the master of ceremonies. I'm not a Harry Potter fan, but it would take a heart of stone not to enjoy an evening like this.If you can't face the full five minutes, jump to 2'30\".

{"title": "Post-apocalypse Now", "date": "Tuesday, March 10, 2009", "text": "It's interesting to see how many mainstream, literary authors are writing post-apocalyptic novels at the moment. It's no mystery why. With global warming, terrorism, the end of oil and, now, the recession hitting the headlines every other day, people no longer enjoy the same sense of security that they had ten years ago. Every age has its neuroses, whether they are about God, sex, death or class. Ours is about the future.\r\rAre we living at the end of this particular civilisation? If so, what are the causes? Can we avoid that same fate that has befallen every other empire in history? If not, what will become of humanity?\r\rPublished last week, Far North is the latest addition to the growing number of dystopian novels and has been compared to Cormac McCarthy's The Road. I'm not sure how valid that comparison is. Yes, civilisation has collapsed. Yes, the main character is on a quest to find a place of safety and yes, there are gangs of marauding bandits, but the similarity ends there. McCarthy barely hinted at the nature of the disaster and his novel was ultimately about the love between a father and son.\r\rMarcel Theroux is more ambitious, daring to answer the big questions.\r\rI've just finished reading a proof copy and the result is less satisfying than Cormac McCarthy's masterpiece, but Far North is still a cracking read which should appeal to a wide cross-section of readers. Theroux is a natural storyteller and doesn't allow his narrative to become hostage to the novel's central message.\r\rSet in Siberia in the near future, Far North begins in the ruins of a city established by people who thought that they could flee the coming global crisis. The sole survivor, Makepeace, ekes out on existence by scavenging and growing plants from seeds found in an abandoned hardware store. Makepeace could probably survive this way until death, but somethings happens which changes the course of Makepeace's life and the story that follows is utterly compelling.\r\r <!--  /* Style Definitions */  p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-parent:\"\"; margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";} @page Section1 {size:612.0pt 792.0pt; margin:72.0pt 90.0pt 72.0pt 90.0pt; mso-header-margin:36.0pt; mso-footer-margin:36.0pt; mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 {page:Section1;} --> The origins of Far North lie in Marcel Theroux's own life. In 2004, he was asked to present a television programme about climate change and claims that he was asked because he knew very little about the subject and had few preconceived ideas, other than a vague belief that environmentalist were spoilsports.\r\rThe experience had a huge effect on Theroux and he became firmly convinced by the environmentalists' arguments.\r\rTwo years later, Theroux made Death of a Nation - a documentary about Russia's problems since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Theroux travelled extensively in Russia, visiting places that closely resembled the post-apocalyptic landscapes of the imagination. Theroux's descriptions of the bleak, Siberian taiga and its sparse settlements are one of Far North's greatest strengths.\r\r\rOnce known as the 'third Theroux', Marcel Theroux says that he has learned to live with the fact that he was first Paul's son, then Louis' brother. However, on the strength of his latest novel, I wouldn't be surprised if he eclipses both of them in the future."},
{"title": "Hastings", "date": "Saturday, March 07, 2009", "text": "When I was 10, I was sent away to a children's home by the sea. Run by a charity, it was a rather strange place and wouldn't have been out of place in a Charles Dickens novel. My parents were only allowed to visit me once a month and when they arrived, I always begged them to take me to Hastings.We even went there for a holiday. That's how good Hastings was.Then, in the 1980s, things changed. Most people could afford to holiday abroad and the traditional British coastal resorts slowly died. In the case of Hastings, the local authorities entered into a Faustian pact in which unemployed people from different parts of Britain could leave their home towns and live in the local hotels and guest houses.It seemed like a win-win situation.The hotels had a guaranteed income and the unemployed were swapping an industrial town for a holiday resort. Unfortunately, although there may have been an injection of cash into the local economy, the end result was named by the tabloids as the Costa del Dole - a haven for petty thieves, drug addicts and teenage mothers.I've no idea how much of this is true, but this image of Hastings, combined with the appalling transport connections, meant that it was one of the least desirable areas in Sussex. Silly people like me spent a fortune on tiny houses in Lewes, whilst the really clever ones bought beautiful, huge Victorian houses in the Old Town of Hastings.I went to Hastings today for the first time in years. Parts of it are undeniably hideous and many of the locals look like the remnants of some failed experiment to cross-breed humans with apes,  but I still really like it. If you want character, Hastings has it. If Hastings was a person, it would be a mad, alcoholic uncle who used to be a sailor. Never dull, slightly threatening and full of surprises.The first surprise today was the West Hill Lift, a strange, Victorian funicular railway, tucked away in a back street:For a mere £2, you can buy a return ticket that takes you up to Hastings Castle and a tourist attraction called Smugglers' Adventure. As a rule, I find that anything with the word adventure in it usually falls a long way short of anything approaching mild excitement, but I was pleasantly surprised.Situated in a network of dimly-lit, man-made caves, Smugglers' Adventure managed to be both entertaining and informative, with an atmosphere that was spooky enough to excite children without completely traumatising them.My son loved this bloodthirsty scene:However I was more interested in this strange figure carved in the rock:Its origins are unknown and whilst many believe it is a medieval saint, it is also possible that this is a much older pagan image that predates Christianity.The more I looked at it, the more I was reminded of this character from Star Trek:After the caves, we walked around the Old Town and explored some of the quirky, interesting shops. In one bookshop I found this beautiful edition of a novel by R.M.Ballantyne:I was tempted to buy it just for the illustrations:Not to mention this book plate:I wonder who Bertie Mason was. Did he survive the Great War? When did he die? He may have descendants out there who would love to have this book.I would have loved to have spent longer browsing through the shelves, but when you have a nine-year-old boy with you it's not possible. I shall have to return. This bookshop in particular appealed; the opposite of today's dull, sterile chain bookshops:The Old Town is lovely and I started to wish that I'd been one of those forward-thinking Londoners who decided to forgo the dubious pleasures of a two-bedroom flat in Brighton for a four-bedroom Victorian house in Hastings. I'd be in excellent company, with at least two fellow bloggers as neighbours.There's no denying that much of Hastings is rough, but even the less desirable parts of the town have some beautiful buildings that have a seedy opulence about them and perhaps Hastings' decline and poor transport links to London have saved it from the sort of gentrification that has turned parts of Sussex into extensions of Islington.Before we left, we passed a boating lake that was closed for the winter:Can you see a strange object in the foreground? On closer inspection it turned out to be a tiny bald, tutu-wearing doll, planted in the murky bed of the pond:It was too big to be one of Slinkachu's Little People, but it wasn't there by accident.Today's visit reminded me why I loved Hastings so much as a boy. Why had it taken me so long to go back?"},

There's a limit to how much I want to know about someone's life and on Twitter, even Stephen Fry is boring.But worst of all is the camera function. It is the Kodak Instamatic of the digital era, producing blurred, grainy images that look as if they've been copied from CCTV. I will never understand those people who record the most important events of their lives in glorious 0.3 megapixels resolution. I briefly used my phone's camera function until I discovered how crap it was.Here are some of the pictures I took:One evening I was walking to Lewes station when I saw these oil paintings, attached to some railings. I don't know why they were there. The next day they were gone. This giant human figure, lying on the floor of Victoria station, made the normally grim-faced commuters stop and smile.This is the famous Lewes Dancing Man, strutting his stuff to a Rolling Stones track. During the last few years he has acquired a minor cult status and there are now videos on YouTube. Überchav, sitting opposite me on a train. Luckily he was too engrossed in his game to spot me taking photos. The camera failed to capture his wispy little blonde moustache.These two drunks staggered around a shopping arcade before collapsing on top of each other. What began as a comic scene ended up being sad and touching, as two men nestled-up together and fell into a deep sleep.In my last shop I reluctantly agreed to let a local woman have an 'angel healing' evening. Before the event began she requested some time alone on the shop floor so that she could 'cleanse the space'. She was standing right in front of the CCTV camera and I'm afraid I gave into temptation.As you can see, some of these images might have made good photos if they hadn't been taken on my crappy camera phone. I shall never use it again."},

AS IT REALLY HAPPENED.'It would be inconceivable for a book as important as Primo Levi's If This Is a Man to be allowed to go out of print. Aside from its literary merits, the subject matter has secured its status as a 20th century classic. However, Anatoli Kuznetsov's Babi Yar hasn't enjoyed the same fate.Babi Yar was the scene of one of the most appalling acts of mass murder of the Second World War. 200,000 people - mainly Jews - were killed by the Germans and thrown into an open grave. Most of the victims were shot, but there are also accounts of women being gang-raped and beaten before being buried alive.Anatoli Kuznetsov was a 12-year-old boy when the Germans invaded his home city of Kiev and for the next few years he kept a secret diary, recording both personal and anecdotal accounts of family, friends and neighbours. This diary became the basis for Kuznetsov's 'documentary novel' Babi Yar.In some ways Babi Yar is a misnomer for Kuznetsov's book, because the massacres mercifully only occupy a few chapters. I say mercifully because, with the best will in the world, I don't think I could face reading 460 odd pages of people being shot, beaten, raped and gassed.So what is Babi Yar? The narrative itself is primarily a young boy's memoir of survival and it is written with great wit and a typically Russian sense of the absurd (yes, I know Kiev's in the Ukraine, but Kuznetsov is half-Russian). It is the author's humour that makes the rest of the novel bearable.But first and foremost, Babi Yar is an impassioned polemic against man's inhumanity to man and Kuznetsov is as scathing about Stalin's regime as he is about the Nazis:'Soviet humanism, German humanism, Assyrian humanism, Martian humanism - there were so many of them in the world and the primary aim of each one was to kill off as many people as possible; they all began and ended in Babi Yars.''What is this banditry going on all over the world? First one gang appeared, with their red banners and fine slogans, murdering, robbing and destroying. Now another has arrived, also with red banners and fine slogans, also murdering, robbing and destroying. You are all bandits. Some people build and work and labour in the sweat of their brows, then the looters come along, who have never created anything since the day they were born but know how to shoot. And they grab everything for themselves. It is you, and only you, the ones who do the shooting, who are the real, genuine enemies. HENCEFORWARD AND TO THE END OF MY DAYS I SHALL HATE YOU AND YOUR MISERABLE WEAPONS, MAYBE I SHALL DIE IN ONE OF YOUR PRISONS OR FROM ONE OF YOUR BULLETS, BUT I SHALL DIE FULL OF CONTEMPT FOR YOU AS THE MOST LOATHSOME THING ON THIS EARTH.'Unsurprisingly, Babi Yar didn't go down terribly well with the Soviet censors. The only surprise is that an edited version was allowed to be published. Kuznetsov copied the original manuscript on 35mm film and after convincing the KGB that he was trustworthy, was permitted to travel to London in 1969 to do some research. Kuznetsov decided to smuggle the manuscript film out in the lining of his jacket.In London, Kuznetsov eluded his KGB minder and defected to Great Britain. Three years later a new version of Babi Yar appeared, containing the original manuscript and passages that Kuznetsov didn't dare write in the Soviet Union. In the Penguin translation, the censored material appears in bold type whilst the additions are in parentheses.Kuznetsov died of a heart attack in 1979 at the age of 49. Some people suspected foul play, but there was no conclusive evidence.Why is Babi Yar out of print? It is a well-written, powerful account of life under Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism and, literary merits aside, is a vital historical document. It could be argued that the attrocities at Babi Yar were eclipsed by the horrors of the camps, but that doesn't justify the fate of this great novel.I hope that an enlightened publisher decides to reprint this compelling and important book."},
{"title": "Going Underground - Part Two", "date": "Monday, February 16, 2009", "text": "When I was a student, I visited Czechoslovakia a year before the Berlin Wall fell. I had no idea what to expect and wondered if Western propaganda had exaggerated the grim image of Eastern Europe. But as I left Prague station with my girlfriend, we both felt a palpable sense of gloom about the city.We had travelled from Vienna and were struck by the contrast between the two cities. Vienna was smart, lively and cosmopolitan. Prague was frozen in time, decaying, depressed and eerily quiet for a capital city.Two scenes in particularly stay in the mind. In the first, my girlfriend and I were unsuccessfully trying to negotiate our way through a system of tunnels under a main road. A middle-aged man saw us struggling and subtly signalled to us that we should follow him. He marched ahead, afraid to be seen talking to Westerners, and with small hand gestures pointed the way. When we reached the end of the tunnel, he gave a brief, shy smile and quickly waved goodbye. In the second scene, I remember how people were eating ice creams as they walked home from work. Every ice cream was the same flavour - only one was available - and they were all a pathetically small size. How much effort would it have taken to at least have a choice between strawberry and vanilla?All this is a roundabout way of saying that my experience gave me a rather negative impression of the old Soviet bloc countries.  But in spite of that, I would still rather take my chances in Stalin's Russia than live through any form of nuclear conflict.The received wisdom is that the nearest we came to nuclear war was the Cuban Missile Crisis. However, it is now becoming clear that there were other, potentially more serious flashpoints during the 1980s. If an attack had been launched against Britain, then Kelvedon Hatch would have been one of the main control centres for the UK.Built in the 1950s and decommissioned in 1992, this bunker was built to accommodate up to 600 people for three months without the need to replenish supplies. Most of the equipment is from the 1980s, including some old Apple computers with huge diskettes.Here are some photos I took last week:The entrance to the bunker is the front door of a modern farmhouse. Once you're inside, this tunnel takes you into the centre of a hill. Walking alone down this long tunnel, passing rows of geiger counters, is a rather unsettling experience. But what follows is even stranger.The bunker complex begins with the communications section: a series of rooms filled with radios, telex equipment and phones. There is even a BBC studio, to broadcast reassuring messages to the nation, or what's left of it.To the left of this machine is a door leading to a vast, private telephone exchange. I have no idea why there is a copy of the Yellow Pages. I can't imagine that anyone would be dialling out for a pizza.A cheery little map that allows bunker personnel to measure radiation yield, wind speeds and fallout levels. Many of the bunker staff would have lived locally, so they'd be able to work out whether Auntie Doris had been nuked or not. This photo was only taken a few days ago, but it looks more like 20 years.Even the end of civilisation needs a good logo and this one is quite appealing. I'd love to know what brief they gave the artist who designed it. It looks a little bit like the W.A.S.P. symbol in Stingray.This is the Prime Minister's room, complete with faded Hay Wain. It is unlikely that any senior officials would have had time to travel from London to the bunker.'Hello, is that Social Security? My workplace has just been vaporised. Can I claim Jobseeker's Allowance?'It's hard to convey the sheer scale of the bunker. This picture only shows a part of the main operations room, which contains desks for every Government ministry.I love the combination of grim, top secret documents and the image of British Telecom's inane Busby logo.If you're feeling a slightly under the weather, the bunker has medical facilities. I would prefer a little more privacy when going to the loo, particularly as this is a corridor.Ominously, there are plenty of hospital beds in the bunker and even a makeshift operating theatre.And only a few feet away from the operating table, there is a selection of coffins and body bags, just to cheer you up.I cannot begin to imagine working in this environment, even during peacetime. Given that a single nuclear warhead is 250 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb, this bunker is effectively a tomb, offering its inhabitants nothing more than a delayed death.On a cheerier note, you can hire the bunker for weddings and children's parties. I'd love to know what sort of freak would hold their child's sixth birthday party in a nuclear bunker.I wonder how much they charge?"},

It made the whole experience even spookier.For two hours I was in one of the safest places in Britain and if anyone had decided to launch an impromptu nuclear strike, I would have been completely unscathed. Physically, at least. Mentally, I'm not sure how well I'd have coped with living on a diet of Huntley and Palmers biscuits with only a malodorous Essex farmer to keep me company.While I was in the bunker I took lots of photos, but they don't really capture the unsettling atmosphere of the place, so I've also made this short film with some added BBC Radiophonic musique concrete from the late 1960s.

I'd never had that much money before and was sorely tempted, but I couldn't bear the idea of having to wear a silly uniform and take part in team activities. I had enough of that at school.I politely declined and never heard from him again.The following year my best friend joined and, although I still had no urge to be a Cub, I was rather jealous of his badges. We spent rainy afternoons in his attic bedroom, poring over the Cub Scout handbook and I secretly yearned to have a Scientist badge. I owned a chemistry set and had performed several life-threatening experiments. Surely I would qualify?In the end I resisted temptation. The Cub Scout movement seemed far too goody-goody to be any fun.However, I was unaware of these badges, as featured in the Ladybird Book of Cub Scouts:1. The Obscene Telephone Call badge:Normal heavy breathing achieves the standard bronze award. Extra marks are given for reversing the charges and asking questions about the colour of underwear.2. The Narcotics Cultivation badge:This highly prestigious badge takes the Cub Scout through the whole process, from successfully cultivating a plant in secret, to refining it in the laboratory and selling the finished product to members of the public.3. The Urban Degeneration Badge:To qualify for this award, candidates are required to distribute litter around residential areas without being detected. Later, they will offer to remove the rubbish as part of a lucrative bob-a-job exercise.4. The Pornography badge:This badge is awarded to Scouts who can find disgarded pornographic material in parks and woodlands. Since the advent of the internet, this once common skill is increasingly rare.5. The Abduction badge:This badge requires the abduction of at least five children and one adult for a minimum of two hours.6. The Church Desecration badge:Armed with nothing more than the Ladybird book What To Look For Inside a Church, these young cubs can steal valuable medieval artefacts without arousing suspicion. Their theft of a Tudor silver chalice raised enough money to pay for plane tickets to the 97th International Scout Jamboree in Oregon.I apologise to Ladybird books and the artist John Berry, but I can't look at their idyllic illustrations without thinking of a darker alternative, particularly when they depict a fine, upstanding organisation like the Boy Scout movement.As for the Girl Guides..."},

{"title": "Hermans' Hermit", "date": "Friday, February 06, 2009", "text": "I wonder how many novels were published in English between 1966 and 2006? Hundreds of thousands, I expect. Perhaps even millions. The only thing I can say with any certainty is that nearly all of them will now be out of print, sometimes deservedly so.With so many new novels appearing every year, it is scandalous that it has taken 40 years for someone to publish the Dutch writer W F Hermans' masterpiece Beyond Sleep. Still, better late than never; particularly when the translation is as good as Ina Rilke's.Beyond Sleep is narrated by Alfred Issendorf, a geologist in his mid-20s who has travelled to Norway to join an expedition to the far north of the country. Alfred hopes that in the barren, rocky wastelands of Finnmark, he will find evidence that will vindicate his mentor's bizarre theories about the origins of certain holes, but from early on he is frustrated by events.To make things worse, Alfred discovers that his Norwegian companions are much fitter than he is and manage to hike across the rough terrain with great ease, leaving him straggling behind, frequently losing his balance as they effortlessly cross rivers and marshes.Alfred looks forward to settling down to a good night's rest, but in the land of the midnight sun there is no respite from the day. No matter how tired he feels, the constant daylight and loud snoring of his friend Arne take their toll on Alfred's state of mind. Beyond sleep, Alfred  becomes increasingly paranoid about his companions.Exhausted, covered in mosquito bites and frequently wet, Alfred knows that he is on a journey that will end in failure and becomes increasingly preoccupied with the futility of his search to find meaning in his life:I know that I am nothing but a chemical compound in a particular state of equilibrium, strictly confined within distinct, incontrovertible boundaries...I do not feel sad, only profound pity for all those people who are so distant from me, and even if I had a radio...there would be no point telling them what I think. They are beyond my understanding and I am beyond theirs.Stamped indelibly on their minds are the craziest fairy tales...And even if they do not believe in fairy tales that does not mean that they have given up hope of gaining spiritual revelations from manifest mumbo jumbo. Because, they say, we cannot go on living like this, we are lost souls and we need consolation (I go on living, don't I. And who's consoling me?)Beyond Sleep could easily have been a bleak, existential novel in which nothing happens (not that that's a bad thing), but Hermans' sense of the absurd makes this a very funny book that continually delights and surprises. Just when you think you have the measure of the novel, Hermans suddenly changes gear.Masterpiece is a dangerous word to use, but I think that I can safely apply it to this novel. If you want a more learned second opinion, read John Self's comments here.Hermans' author photos usually give an impression of him as a miserable old bugger, so here are a couple of pictures to redress the balance:And here's Hermans during his failed audition for the role of Blofeld in You Only Live Twice:Ina Rilke has also translated Hermans' The Darkroom of Damocles, which I enjoyed almost as much as Beyond Sleep. Both novels are only available in hardback, but they're worth every penny.Let's hope that the rest of Hermans' ouevre becomes available in English, otherwise I'll have to invest in a copy of Teach Yourself Dutch."},

I can imagine him pouring me a whisky in his office before discussing the ungentlemanly business of borrowing money. He looks far too genial to be the author of post-apocalyptic fiction.Empty World is a novel written for young adults about a virus that wipes out almost the entire human population. Like John Christopher's fiction for adults it offers a fairly bleak view of human nature, but as Puffin don't usually publish novels with gang rape scenes (with the possible exception of Melvyn Burgess), the drama is a little more restrained.As with everything written by Sam Youd (John Christopher's real name), Empty World is an enjoyable work of escapist fiction that is consistently gripping and thoughtful. The average customer review on Amazon is five stars - a rare accolade for any novel - so why is it out of print?The simple answer is that however good a novel is, unless it is heralded as a great work of literature or the author is commercially successful, it will probably go out of print.When I worked in bookselling I remember the dreaded acronym RPUC - reprint under consideration. At first I used to convey this information to customers, who would then plague me for months, to the point where I had to hide in the stock cupboard until they left. I soon realised that RPUC was as good as OP - out of print.It's depressing seeing a much-loved book fade into obscurity, but the beauty of the internet is that readers now have a voice. I have no doubt that Penguin's decision to reissue John Christopher's The Death of Grass has something to do with the huge demand for secondhand copies on the internet. As for Empty World, I'm sure that it will sell if only someone can come up with a better jacket than this:The artist, David Chestnutt, has produced some highly-acclaimed psychedelic record covers, but this illustration looks like he's had some bad acid."},
{"title": "The Horror", "date": "Saturday, January 31, 2009", "text": "During a recent visit to a charity shop, I discovered this paperback memoir, published in 2004:The sensationalist title and Mail on Sunday recommendation were almost enough to put me off, but the blurb on the back was fascinating:'When Helga Schneider was four, her mother Trudi abandoned her to pursue her career. In 1998, Helga received a letter asking her to visit Trudi, then 90 years old, before she died. Mother and daughter had only met once before, on a disastrous visit where Helga first learnt the terrible secret of her mother's past.  Trudi was an extermination guard in Auschwitz and Ravensbruck and was involved in Nazi 'medical' experiments on prisoners. She had never expressed any remorse for her actions, yet Helga still hoped that at this final meeting she would find some way to forgive her mother.'I have read a number of books about the Holocaust, beginning with Primo Levi's If This is a Man and thought that I had become pretty unshockable. However, in this short memoir, there is more horror than some of the most harrowing concentration camp memoirs. It is not just Trudi Schneider's lack of remorse that shocks the reader, but also her undiminished hostility towards the Jews:'Those Jewish whores had to understand where they were and why...they were always tired and difficult, and at night they whined for the children they had lost along the way...'Today, we are familiar with the horrific photos of mass graves and emaciated prisoners standing behind barbed wire fences, but few compare to this image in its ability to convey vast, industrial scale of the camps: Astoundingly, in the midst of this genocide, Trudi and her colleagues were having the time of their lives:Trudi's proud recollections of her work in the camps make this a harrowing enough read, but there is one element of horror that makes this book particularly shocking, in a way that no Holocaust memoir can match:'How long did it take for the victims of the gas chambers...' I can't go on.'The gas took between three and fifteen minutes to have its effect,' she replies in a detached and technical tone.'And is it true that after a certain point the exposure time was shortened?''Well, they had to get through 12,000 Stück a day; they'd raised the quota.''So it was possible that when you opened the doors of the gas chambers, there might have been some people who weren't quite dead?''Of course! It often happened with the children. Sometimes those little bastards were more resistant to the rat poison than the adults were,' she adds with a sarcastic chuckle.Earlier, Trudi is asked if she ever felt sorry for the children:'And why should I have? A Jewish child would have become a Jewish adult, and Germany had to free itself of that loathsome race. How many times do I have to repeat that?'Holocaust memoirs take the reader to the edge of death, but they are written by survivors. Let Me Go is a harrowing but vital account of what happened to those who didn't live to tell the tell.The charitable view of Helga Schneider's mother is that in order to maintain her sanity, she could allow no room for doubt and compassion. Before going to the camps she underwent a 'dehumanisation' process and it could be argued that Trudi was brainwashed into participating in these atrocities. However, the fact remains that Trudi Schneider was a volunteer, abandoning her young children for the greater glory of the Third Reich.For Trudi Schneider there is no redemption and as their meeting draws to an end, Helga knows that she will never return."},

You're dead. That's it. Adieu. Farewell.  Eternity awaits? Oh, sure!  It's Putrefaction and Manure  And unrelenting Rot, Rot, Rot,  As you regress, from Zoo. to Bot.  I'll Grieve, of course, Departing wife, Though Grieving's never Lengthened Life Or coaxed a single extra Breath Out of a Body touched by Death.I bought a copy of Crace's novel a couple of weeks ago and loved it. If you haven't read the book, it can be summed-up fairly succinctly: a couple in their fifties are murdered on a beach and what follows is a post-mortem of their lives and the physical processes that occur between the moment of death and the discovery of the bodies.In the hands of a lesser writer, a description of the putrefication of the victims' bodies would be repugnant, but Crace's breathtakingly good prose finds a poignant beauty in the natural processes that occur. This is the atheist vision of death: meaningless, loveless and hopeless, but also without evil. For Crace, death is not the undiscovered country, but a process that can be chronicled with scientific precision. Crace's undiscovered country is life and memory.However, there was one thing I found difficult about Being Dead and although I've searched extensively on Google, I haven't found a satisfactory answer. Where is the novel set? A sense of place is vital in a novel and even if the setting is a fictitious one, it is usually dovetailed into an instantly reconisable landscape. We know that Trollope's Barchester Chronicles are set in a southern English cathedral city, whilst David Lodge's University of Rummidge is clearly a thinly-disguised Birmingham. But where is Being Dead?At first I assumed that Crace had set his novel in Britain, but I soon became aware of incongruities that was increasingly distracting as the narrative progressed. A mention of the 'local manac beans (and) green milk' was rather confusing, as were the references to drinking gleewater and Boulevard liquer. I went through a list of possible suspects: the West Indies, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and even Spain, but nothing fitted.There was no gleewater or Boulevard liquer anywhere. Neither was there a poet called Sherwin Stephens. For some reason, Crace had decided to set this novel in a fictitious, unnamed country that contained elements of recognisable landscapes, but juxtaposed in a way that was unlike anywhere on earth. For me, that was the greatest mystery of Being Dead.Hence the title of this posting: The Undiscovered Country. I apologise in advance to anyone who was hoping for a critique on Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country."},
{"title": "One careful owner...", "date": "Tuesday, January 13, 2009", "text": "Last year Chas Newkey-Burden wrote an amusing article in the Guardian called 'Why I hate second-hand books':For me, as a literary experience, they are akin to sloppy seconds, a salad bar in a staff canteen at the end of a hot weekday, or a recently-vacated cubicle in a public toilet. Let's be clear: I don't merely have a mild preference for buying brand-new. No, I'm digestively squeamish about used books. It's all those stains, thumbprints and creases that get me so queasy. I'm far from a gentle reader and by the time I've taken in the first few chapters of any brand-new tome, it will often be creased and coffee-stained beyond recognition. But they will be my creases and my stains, and that's what matters.I've lost count of the amount of times that I've been confronted by the dried-up bogey of the previous owner, smeared across one of the pages. Nice. Most of these mucus moments occurred while I was reading books I'd borrowed from the library.I completely agree about the library books. I also used to wonder why so many books contained dried snot, but I was surprised that Chas Newkey-Burden didn't mention the other curse of library books: pubic hairs. I never cease to be amazed at the ability of pubic hairs to appear in the most improbable places and in the case of library books, I wonder if there are lots of naked readers.I suppose they could be the beard hairs of sage bibliophiles, but I know a pube when I see one.However, I think there is a big difference between library books and second-hand ones. Library books have been pawed by a variety of people. Second-hand books have usually had one careful owner. I have never discovered any unsavoury bodily products in a second-hand book, but I have been pleasantly surprised in other ways.Yesterday I went to Tunbridge Wells and discovered the wonderful Hall's Second-hand Bookshop where I bought this book:Later, flicking through the pages, I discovered an unusual bookmark: a 1940s London Underground ticket:I immediately felt connected to the original reader, for whom this was contemporary fiction. The ticket was an added bonus, as was this bookmark, which I posted in the summer:A Google search on Gay Foam yields very different results these days.But it's not just unexpected bookmarks that make second-hand books such a joy. During the last month I have bought several books that turned out to be signed copies, including this paperback:When I paid two quid for this at a charity shop, I had no idea that I was getting a signed copy. Thank you, Cancer Research.Yesterday's trip to Tunbridge Wells also yielded the following results:Ever heard of this author? I hadn't, but when I read a recommendation that compared this trilogy to Patricia Highsmith, I had to buy it.I hadn't heard of this novel either:I'd heard of the poem Babi Yar by Yevgeni Yevtushenko, because it was the inspiration for Shostakovich's 13th Symphony, but this was new to me. Apparently it was smuggled out of the Soviet Union.I can understand Chas Newkey-Burden's objections to the used book. I used to be the Howard Hughes of books and would often reject brand new books if they weren't absolutely perfect. But the message is more important than the medium. I stopped being precious about my books when I had children and life became too chaotic to be anal about the condition of my possessions.These days I'm not that bothered if a book looks as if it's been around the block a few times. What matters is the text (although I still draw the line at public hair and snot).Ms Baroque has quite rightly taken me to task on the issue of royalties and that is something that needs to be addressed, but after enduring two years of Waterstone's bland 3 for 2 promotions, the random selection offered by second-hand and charity shops is a liberation."},

The rest of the year would be warm. I want heatwaves and frost fairs. What I can't stand is the dull, grey, mild weather that seems to have replaced the seasons for much of the year.The graveyard belongs to St Michael and All Angels' Church, Berwick. On the outside it is a pleasant, 12th century church. However, the interior is quite unlike anything else in Britain:Before the Reformation most church walls were covered in murals and during the 1940s, Bishop Bell of Chichester sought to revive this tradition, commissioning works of art from contemporary artists like Chagall and Piper. The result was a triumph, in which masterpieces of modern art sat alongside their medieval counterparts.Bishop Bell also commissioned members of the Bloomsbury Group to decorate the church in Berwick. During the next few years, Virginia Woolf's sister Vanessa Bell, Duncan Grant, Quentin Bell and Angelica Bell embarked on a series of murals, paintings and decorations:There paintings aren't great works of art, but the sum is greater than its parts and it's interesting to see a contemporary interpretation of the medieval church.

I’ve been loveless,  clasped and virtuous, dreamless, skinless, tongueless :  but now I have you, Next, a leap to the future  tense : I’m thinking about your hips, your weight,  your possibilities, your previous lovers ;  and even if it never happens, the kissing  of places beneath new lace, you’ll still have been  my next lover, now. Thanks for the weekend.     \rKaty Evans-Bush is currently in the middle of a virtual author tour and has kindly agreed to stop here to answer a few questions.\r\r     First of all, thanks for visiting. This is the first author event I’ve had that hasn’t involved ordering several dozen wine glasses from Oddbins, so I shall have to improvise. I’ll start with a virtual cheesy nibble...\r     Q – I’d like to know how you ended up moving to London...\r     I heard they had loads of wine at their author events! No, really. I came over for something to do, really. Imagine it: an aunt in Finsbury Park, and Kings Road there for the taking only a few years too late… I studied English Lit for a year, hooked up with a boy, and stayed.\r     Q – And how has this shaped your identity as a writer?\r     For many years it confused the hell out of me. I wasn’t in America and I wasn’t yet properly in England. Even though both countries ostensibly speak the same language, it was like being transplanted into a foreign one – but I didn’t even have my original language to myself, everything was mixed up and muddied. Slang, accents, figures of speech, frames of reference. It took me about nine years – and two babies – to sort all that out, and even then when I first began writing again it was “in American.” It was another five years before I really owned my geographical space, as it were. Now I just feel like a Londoner, but as so many people have pointed out about the book, I really do have a foot on each side of the Atlantic, and people often tell me how very New York I am... I grew up reading American poetry, of course. As well as Pound and Eliot. Oh, wait...\r\r     Q – I’ve always liked RS Thomas, but it was only when he did a reading at my university that I felt that I truly understood his writing. Do you think poems are best read aloud?\r     Nah.\r\r     I know that goes against the orthodoxy. Well, I think some poems might be best read aloud! Maybe “James James Morrison Morrison” – the favourite poem I share with Jonny B – or even something like “Kubla Khan” – but not The Waste Land, and not Frost at Midnight. I think poems work best if read alertly to oneself in that private inner voice we all have that isn’t as crude as a real voice. A real voice locks the poem down so much; and so many poems are aso complicated, you need to be able to see them and think about them and read them slowly.\r     Having said that, Radio 3 recently played Anton Lesser’s reading of the entirety of Paradise Lost, an hour a day, and it was wonderful. Even though I don’t like his reading. I thought Tom Baker would have been better. And it would have been better if I’d had the book to hand.\r     The poet George Szirtes talks about the “intimacy” of reading aloud, the history of reading things aloud to small audiences, and the very best poetry readings can be like this. Though that is very rare. You want to feel like someone is really telling you something – like the Ancient Mariner, that they’re almost buttonholing you with it.\r     Q – As a bookseller I found poetry impossible to sell. Are you frustrated by the degree to which poetry is marginalised in contemporary society, or do you feel that the internet offers some hope for writers to find readers?\r     Well, hope is a thing with feathers. Here I am on the internet!\r\r     But yes: tremendously frustrated. I always have been, ever since I found out – though I had a sheltered childhood, and never knew till I became a bookseller myself, at the Penguin Bookshop in Covent Garden. (Ah, those heady days! Peter Mayer was head of Penguin then, touting his pile ‘em high & sell ‘em like carrots philosophy everywhere; shortly after that computerised stocktaking came in, Books Etc. ate London and the rest is history.)\r     Seriously, I think people are deprived of words, which is like saying they’re deprived of meaning. Many people say they like poetry, or would like it, or used to like it. But the way things are set up nowadays you practically aren’t allowed to like it. Thank God I grew up in a house full of books, in a family of people who loved words. And I have such exciting, deep, intense ideas for things I want to do, I plan to make some really beautiful poems this year, and it’s terrible to think hardly anyone will want them…\r\r     Q – This may be an impossible question, but how long would a poem like ‘To My Next Lover’ take to write?\r\r     That one took half an hour. I swear to God. I sent it to a magazine editor, Michael Mackmin at the Rialto, throwing it in as a makeweight among a load of poems I thought were really good. He took that one. And none of the others! It’s so often the case… So it wasn’t till it was published and everyone was telling me they loved it, how funny, how bittersweet, how fucking tragic to admit to watching EastEnders, that I looked at it and saw that it was okay. And it really was the best storyline they ever had! Nothing can beat the beauty of that, except maybe the time Phil framed Den Watts for murder, throwing that gun down on him through the skylight…\r     Sometimes writing is really fun. It feels like telling yourself jokes. That was one of the times.\r     Q – On your website you mention that you’re working on a novel. Can you tell me anything about it?\r     No. I’d have to shoot you. I said that in a moment of insanity. I said it to make myself do it.\r     Q – Finally, I notice that growing up in the USA you must have watched The Osmonds. Are you a little bit country or a little bit rock n’roll?\r     Sweetie, I’m a little bit country AND a little bit rock n- roll. And I also used to watch the Jackson Five cartoon.\rMe and the Dead is published by the wonderful Salt Publishing.\r  I won't bring too many books."},
{"title": "A Ghostly Apparition", "date": "Saturday, January 03, 2009", "text": "Today I had an hour to kill before picking my wife and son up from the cinema (I couldn't face seeing Madagascar 2), so I went to St Andrew's church in Bishopstone - a tiny hamlet hidden away behind the dreary seaside town of Seaford.At first appearance, St Andrew's is a typical Sussex church:But a closer look reveals an ecclectic mixture of styles and materials and although the original church was founded around 1,200 years ago, the building we see today is largely Norman.However if you look carefully you can still find parts of the original Saxon church, like this sundial, which is at least a thousand years old:Rather than bore the arse of you with any amateur ecclesiastical history (gleaned, naturally, from my Ladybird book 'What to Look For Inside a Church'), here are some photos:Historic buildings are usually expensive to visit and it can be hard to savour the atmosphere when you're jostling with hordes of tourists. However not only is St Andrew's free, but you can enjoy having a thousand-year-old building all to yourself.I like to listen to the silence and imagine the generations of people who've used the church in the past, but I suppose if the mood took me I could also perform a routine from Flashdance (What a Feelin'). In fact I think that's what I'll do next time.After a few minutes ruminating about whether a better father would have gone to see Madagascar 2,  I decided to explore the graveyard:I must remember to invest in a weather-proof gravestone.As much as I love churches, I'm afraid that I don't believe in the supernatural. However, as I turned a corner in the graveyard, I witnessed a strange apparition emanating from a sarcophagus:It reminded me of those strange photos of 'ectoplasm' that were supposedly caught on camera by ghost-hunters? Was I witnessing a supernatural event?The white mist came towards me and swirled around my feet, like a Hammer Horror fog. I wasn't alarmed, but experienced that slightly unsettled feeling you have when you know that there must be a simple explanation, but can't think of one.Then I found my answer: the outflow vent of a condenser boiler, fixed at the bottom of a wall next to the sarcophagus. Someone must have been doing some washing-up."},

They are called directors and pay themselves a lot of money.The directors are talking about how they can stop the store from closing.They either need to sell more things or spend less money running the store.This is Colin. He is very polite and enjoys gift-wrapping things for customers, but he does it very slowly.The store can save money if it gets rid of Colin.This is a fashion show, where customers can see new clothes.The man in the front is very interested in the pretty lady's green coat, but he knows that it will be cheaper on the internet.The lady's green coat costs £459.

{"title": "Round Robins", "date": "Saturday, December 27, 2008", "text": "I have been away for Christmas, staying in a house that overlooks the local nuclear power station. The only thing that kept me sane was reading WF Hermans' novel The Darkroom of Damocles - a Dutch masterpiece from the 1950s that has only just been translated into English.When I returned to Lewes I found a large pile of cards on the doormat, two of which were 'round robins'. I can only assume that they were sent in error, as I haven't been on speaking terms with either of the senders for a long time. One of the round robins was insufferably smug and depressingly banal in equal measure. The other was merely unintentionally annoying.I hate round robins. I don't particularly want to know about people's wonderful holidays abroad  or read about the progress of their home decorating (one letter informed me that the author's curtains were steam cleaned in August).Also, as the father of a dyslexic child who is about to be screened for an 'Autistic Spectrum Disorder', the last thing I need is proud parents boasting about their perfect children. I'm sure it's very nice that darling Hector is happy at school and has just passed his Grade 7 Flute, but my son has just punched a hole in the wall and spent the best part of an hour screaming with rage, so I'm not really in the mood for tales of exam successes and artistic accomplishments.One of the round robins informed me that:2008 has been a rather fab year. Even all the building work was fun. Zoan (yes, Zoan) loved watching the diggers, climbing up the scaffolding (+up... +up!) while me and Pandora huddled ever closer as our living became smaller and more primitive. The wonderful transformation revealed itself just in time for the summer hols.After an account of Zoan and Pandora's progress at kindergarten, the letter concluded by expressing the wish that 2008 'bought you joy, new possibilities, an opening mind + heart'.The author of this letter is an extremely nice woman who is intelligent, considerate and self-effacing. However, even she could not manage to write a round robin that wasn't slightly nauseating.I'm not a complete misanthropist. I like to know what's happened to people and it's great when a Christmas card is accompanied by a small note or letter, but I want them to be personal. I appreciate that writing dozens of letters is time consuming but if you value people enough to stay in touch, surely they're worth a quarter of an hour of your time?And if people really do have too many letters to write, why can't they type up a standard round robin and customise each one to make it look like a personal letter?Merry Christmas."},

I normally refuse point blank to visit shopping malls and superstores, but if I dared to allow selfishness to come between my children and the perfect Christmas, I knew that there would be consequences.Toys \"R\" Us is bad enough at the best of times, but the last Thursday before Christmas promised to be hell on earth. The scene would be a Bruegellian nightmare, with crowds of people in flannellete tracksuits pushing and shoving each other. Hideous.I walked through the door preparing myself for unarmed combat, but to my amazement the place was almost empty. At a glance, I'd say that the ratio of staff to customers was three to one.The only shoppers I saw were a rather large couple who looked (and smelled) as if they hadn't bothered washing and dressing when they got up, a woman who was so busy texting that she lost her two-year-old son twice within five minutes, a man who looked uncannily like Max Clifford and a chav couple who stood on either side of me and shouted at each other, almost deafening me in the process.If anyone needed tangible evidence of a recession, it was here.Later, I visited Woolworths. They seemed to be selling an awful lot of electric fans, reduced from £5.99 to £3.49. I didn't buy anything.I would love to think that we had seen the error of our ways and were abondoning the soulless orgy of consumerism that is Christmas for something more meaningful. However I suspect that people are buying the same old crap, but now they're doing it on the internet.Most of our Christmas presents have been ordered from Amazon, which wouldn't have bothered me until last Sunday, when I read this article in the Sunday Times. According to an investigation by undercover reporters, workers in Amazon's UK depots are being forced to work seven days in a row and are penalised for being off sick, even if they produce a doctor's note. I love Amazon, but this has really put me off them and I will try and find a more ethical way of buying books, like this supplier.I don't really want anything for Christmas (unless you include a flat stomach and the ability to travel through time) but if I did have a Christmas list, it would include the following:Action Man is boring. Obsessive-Compulsive Man is far more interesting, finding danger in the most incongruous situations. I have several friends with OCD and they'd love it.I don't think that the above picture conveys the sheer genius of the Angry Mob Playset. As you can see below, they can angrily surround the most incongruous object and wave their torches and pitchforks in a thoroughly malevolent manner:These Communist Russian dolls are a wonderful idea. It's a shame that Andropov and the other bloke (Chernyenko?) couldn't have been included, even if they were only chosen because they were terminally ill.The Freud Action Figure would complement the OCD figure perfectly. The Freud figure could spend hours analysisng OCD Man, only to be superceeded by Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Man (this figure isn't available yet, but it's only a matter of time).I'm not quite sure what the rational is behind the Flying Monkey:It is launched from the wrist, like a flying disc. I imagine that the joke would wear thin after a few minutes, unless you're like my late father-in-law, who continued to find his remote- controlled farting machine hilarious after several years.I'd rather have something that would still give me pleasure in 20 years' time.

{"title": "Whatever happened to James Barlow?", "date": "Tuesday, December 16, 2008", "text": "It isn't easy to find a more obscure novelist than David Karp, but I think I've just succeeded. A recent visit to Camilla's Bookshop in Eastbourne yielded this novel, published in 1961:Yes, that is Larry Olivier on the front cover and the girl is a very young Sarah Miles. Barlow's novel was turned into a film a year after publication and also starred Simone Signoret, Thora Hird and Terence Stamp.Amazingly, it doesn't appear to have been released on DVD or VHS which, no matter how bad the film might be, is surprising given the distinguished cast.In 1963, someone called Bosley Crowther published a damning review in the New York Times, complaining that:'A hero more afflicted than Lazarus and more humble and patient than Job is not likely to cut a dynamic or captivating figure in a film, no matter how finely he is acted, even by Lawrence Olivier. And that's why \"Term of Trial,\" which came to the Paramount yesterday, is not an exciting picture, for all its skittering around a sordid theme. The meek and shabby high school teacher that Mr. Olivier plays in this British rehash of \"Blackboard Jungle,\" with minor \"Lolita\" overtones, is a wistful and well-meaning fellow for whom your heart bleeds a drop or two as you watch him stoically enduring all sorts of troubles and woes. But he's just not enough of a person to make your blood run hot or cold.'Crowther clearly doesn't like what he describes as the 'current British \"kitchen sink\" style' however on this side of the Atlantic the film appears to have been more successful and Olivier received a BAFTA nomination for his performance.I have no idea how good or bad the film is, but the novel is a corker. Set in a nameless industrial town, Term of Trial is a bleak depiction of working class life at the end of the 1950s and its descriptions of sink estates are prescient for a novel written almost half a century ago. With a little editing it wouldn't be hard to pass Term of Trial off as a contemporary novel.To give you a flavour of Barlow's style, here is the first page to click on:As for Barlow himself, there is next to nothing about him on the internet. Not even a small Wikipedia entry. The author blurb says that he was born in 1921, when means that he may still be alive (he's a year older than our friend Sam Youd). However, like David Karp, he appears to have stopped writing novels at the end of the 1960s. I would love to know why.Term of Trial may be derivative in places, but it is a thoughtful, well-written novel that is both a perceptive study of human nature and a compelling social document. It doesn't deserve to be out of print.Addendum: James Barlow died in 1973, at the age of 51."},

However, he was quite adamant that if anything did happen to him, he wanted a non-religious funeral. Today's service was moderated by someone from the British Humanist Association and it was more soulful than any religious service I've attended.My father-in-law also expressed one other wish about his funeral: he wanted Dido's Lament played, from Purcell's opera Dido and Aeneas:When I am laid, am laid in earth, May my wrongs createNo trouble, no trouble in thy breast;Remember me, remember me, but ah! forget my fate.Remember me, but ah! forget my fateWritten 320 years ago, this is one of the most profound and moving pieces of music ever written and as a burial anthem, it beats Robbie Williams' No Regrets any day:"},
{"title": "The Susan Hill Mystery", "date": "Thursday, December 11, 2008", "text": "I thought that Susan Hill was supposed to be the champion of book bloggers. Her love-in with Scott Pack seems to have come to an end, but she has been consistently outspoken in her support of book blogs over the last few years.Two years ago she had a famous spat with the critic and academic, John Sutherland, who had written a very dismissive article about book bloggers. Hill responded with a diatribe against literary critics:'How dare ... these 'literary mandarins' feel they are above us and by implication, above book buyers and readers? The fact is that the tide has turned and the people have power now. One day, their editors will wake up to the fact and give over their space to curling, or dominoes.'One literary editor felt sufficiently moved by these comments to send Susan Hill this letter:Dear Susan Hill,After reading your Blog about Book Review pages, I would like you to know that no book either published or written by you will in future be reviewed on our Literary Pages.In the light of your expressed views, I am sure you will neither be surprised or distressed.It was real handbags at dawn stuff, with heated exchanges between the two sides. Journalist Rachel Cooke joined the Sutherland camp, ridiculing popular book blogs like Dove Grey Reader and Kimbofo.Susan Hill responded by commenting that: 'the idea that those of us who blog about books and reading might somehow be degrading literary taste is a patronizing and ridiculous one. We are writing about books we love. Why on earth should we not do that in a blog, as anywhere else, and improve literary taste, whatever ‘literary taste’ means ?'I was therefore slightly suprised to read Ms Hill make the following comment, in response to an excellent article by Robert McCrum in Sunday's Observer:There is no substitute for a good literary editor and good books pages. They are not only about selling books they are part of a civilised culture. They are on the whole by people who have studied their trade/profession, whose opinion is of value because they have a trained mind. Book Blogs are by amateurs, self-appointed, unedited. They occupy miles of cyber space with endless rehashes of plots and valueless personal opinion. They don`t sell books and they are not worth reading for their own sakes.What has prompted this complete volte-face? Is it an imposter having a little joke? On the other hand, perhaps this is a different Susan Hill. I've checked on Google and there are a lot of them about:Suspect No.1 is also a writer. This Susan Hill lives in Montana and the author of Closer Than Your Skin: Unwrapping the Mystery of Intimacy with God, which is published by Random House USA.I've read her author biog and I think she's too full of Christian charity to have written the above quote.Suspect No.2 is a prominent American golfer and also an author, having co-written a book called Going for Green. The second Susan Hill also spearheads a campaign called Golfers Against Cancer. Although she looks as if she could be a little fierce at times, she doesn't come across as someone who has the killer instinct of an embittered hack.Suspect No.3 lives in Detroit and was 1st runner-up in the 2003 Miss Congeniality competition and also got to first place in the state final of Miss Hooters Michigan-2005 (I must confess that this contest had passed me by, but it evidently has some kudos).She does not do nudes. That's saved me a few minutes on Google and and also ruled out the possibility of my wife discovering the search terms susan hill...naked on my home page.There is no mention of books in her 'resume' so I think that we can safely eliminate her.I can't find out any information about Suspect No.4, except that she is Canadian. That alone incriminates her in my view, given Canada's status as a great literary nation. It is quite plausible that this is the guilty Susan Hill. And she wears glasses. Our final suspect is an Irish acupuncturist who also practices 'moxibustion' (answers on a postcard please) and something that sounds deeply unpleasant: 'bleeding therapy'. I can't see this Susan Hill bothering to post a comment on Robert McCrum's article either. When you can stick needles in real people, who needs cyberspace?So in conclusion, I'm none the wiser. I think that we can safely rule out the real Susan Hill, but I would love to know who thinks that book blogs 'aren't worth reading' and, more to the point, why they used someone else's name. It's a mystery."},
{"title": "Sexy", "date": "Tuesday, December 09, 2008", "text": "During a recent visit to Camilla's Bookshop in Eastbourne, I found this novel by Richard Condon:It reminded how much superfluous nudity there used to be on book covers, before feminism, AIDS and the new conservatism of the 80s changed the cultural climate.When I was fourteen my parents booked a week at a holiday cottage in Somerset. The owners had a large bookcase of paperback fiction and to me, coming from a house without books, it was an object of great curiosity. I went through the whole collection of novels and was particularly excited by the sexy cover designs, which seemed to promise so much:I flicked through all of the Edna O'Briens, hoping to find some naughty bits that would give me an insight into what adults were getting up to. The covers suggested that people were at it all of the time, but the contents were generally disappointing. Even the Dennis Wheatley horror novels were extremely chaste, compared to their salacious covers:Like real life, these novels promised so much and delivered so little. Breasts occasionally heaved and manhoods throbbed, but I was still none the wiser about what would be expected of me. Men seemed to 'take' women who, after an initial attempt at resistance, succumbed with half-closed eyes. I was confused. Wasn't that called rape?Films didn't make things any clearer. Men behaved like complete bastards, women slapped them in the face and then they had a snog. If it was a French film, these actions were accompanied by long, convoluted conversations and chain smoking. I compared these people to my parents, who liked going to garden centres and Brentford Nylons. Where did I fit into all this?A few years later a bookshop opened at the end of my road. It was absurdly small, but had a stock that was chosen by someone who clearly knew what he was doing. I went in out of curiosity and, for reasons I can't remember, ended up buying Turgenev's Spring Torrents. I'd never read a novel before and had no idea who Turgenev was, but his descriptions of people falling in love seemed to make much more sense than the worlds of Sidney Sheldon and Jackie Collins.The Richard Condon and Edna O'Brien novels look rather incongruous amongst the respectable orange Penguins in Camilla's. I wondered how long they'd been on the shelf and was almost tempted to buy them just for the covers, but I got distracted by this:The complete original script, on sale for a mere £1.50. A superb cover too, without a nipple in sight.I was searching through my mother's loft earlier this year when I found this carrier bag:The fashions would suggest that the design comes from around 1974, but given that retailers weren't exactly chasing the zeitgeist in those days, it could have been as late as 1979. Imagine the stigma of carrying your Buzzcocks album around in this bag.I'm quite tempted to sell this on eBay, but I can't find a suitable category for carrier bags.Perhaps I should buy some flares and walk around town with my Woolworths bag.I already have the sideburns."},
{"title": "Dumb it down", "date": "Sunday, December 07, 2008", "text": "I had almost forgotten that it was nearly Christmas. That is one of the many joys of no longer working in bookselling. No more late opening, no two-day Christmas break and, best of all, no bad-tempered customers venting their anger at me.I made the mistake of going shopping in Brighton today. Everyone was in such a bad mood, resentfully lugging several carriers bags of presents. One man even told a pigeon to 'Fuck off!' because it was in his way. The shop assistants were all surprisingly jolly, but it was the insincere mania of people who were terrified of losing their jobs.Like most other areas of retail, Christmas is make or break time for booksellers and in recent years the atmosphere has become increasingly desperate, as the chains try to compete with the internet and supermarkets. My last Christmas was a soulless experience. All of the key buying and marketing decisions had been taken out of my hands and I was left with checklists, planograms (telling me what shelves to display particular titles on) and KPI (key performance indicators) reports.This was a great pity. I used to really enjoy the casino atmosphere of bookselling at Christmas, gambling thousands of pounds of someone else's money. I usually got it right and overall, my empoyers made more money when they trusted me to know my local market.Another unfortunate development in the book trade has been the dumbing down of the Christmas bestellers, something that Ian Jack commented on in an excellent article in Saturday's Guardian:'The newer development in publishing is the ruthless determination on all sides - publisher, book chain, supermarket - to sell books at Christmas beyond the audience who usually buy them. That has called for a different kind of book.'The result is a depressing selection of celebrity memoirs and tv tie-ins, marketed as ideal gifts because, supposedly, we all like Dawn French/Julie Walters/Jeremy Clarkson etc. Caustic Cover Critic has written this superb summary of the year's Christmas bestsellers, of which there is only one title that I would vaguely consider reading.These books will dominate the front of every chain bookshop because although no head office would admit it, they know that many Christmas customers doesn't know how to look for a book in a bookshop.These titles will naturally be sold at huge discounts. However, booksellers will ensure that their overall margin is protected by selling the more upmarket bestselling titles at full price, as the middle classes aren't as price conscious. I suppose the charitable view is that this is a form of progressive taxation.In the meantime, after year of reading first-rate books bought in secondhand shops, I don't see any reason why I would want to visit a chain bookseller again."},

One of the tragedies of good design is that it's often unnoticeable to the layman.The strength of the BBC News website is that in addition to providing a well-designed, accessible overview of the latest news and a huge archive of content, it regularly comes up with quirky, unusual articles that don't appear anywhere else.Today, BBC News had a fascinating item about a map of loneliness in the UK:The loneliest place in Britain is, apparently, Edinburgh, with Stoke-on-Trent at the opposite end of the spectrum. Initially I was surprised to see that the Midlands was the epicentre of human happiness, accompanied by Essex, South-East Wales, Tyneside and Ulster. What about beautiful places like the Highlands of Scotland, Cornwall and North Yorkshire?The answer, of course, is that the parts of Britain that are generally regarded as the most desirable places to live have seen the highest levels of migration. Cornwall, for example, has suffered because migrants and second home owners have priced local people out of the area and ended centuries of continuity. In contrast, although the Midlands had a huge influx of Asian immigrants during the 60s and 70s, the population has been fairly stable for several decades and people feel connected to the area.I am a migrant. I left Twickenham because I was priced out of the local housing market and no longer felt any connection to an area that had so many incomers. I moved to Lewes and unwittingly contributed towards the same process here. I love Sussex, but I am very conscious of being an outsider. They say that home is where the heart is, but mine is in fragments.Judging from this map, it would seem that it doesn't matter where you live. The key to happiness is, as Plato wrote, having a sense of place."},

Lasting for two whole minutes, they were a television event and people made of point of tuning in to see which celebrities would be appear. As a boy, I found these adverts only marginally less thrilling than the Christmas double issue of the Radio Times. Perhaps I should have sniffed glue after all.I never thought I'd feel sad to see the demise of Woolworth's, but they had become part of the culture. Woolies, Pick n'Mix (or Pick n'Nick, as we called it) and the bright, smiling, sales assistants were as quintessentially British as dry rot. Okay, I lied about the staff. The sales assistants generally came across as lobotomised, but that was probably a legitimate reaction to what was essentially a dead end job.My mother worked on the tills at Woolworth's for 16 years. She took her job very seriously and was always extremely cheery and competent, in spite of a management culture that regarded it's shop floor staff as scum. One Christmas she received a bonus of 50p. Even in those days it was bugger all and to add insult to injury, it was a Woolworth's voucher.Shortly before she left, my mother was sent on a course which informed staff that they would have to wear blank badges. Sales assistants giving good customer service would be awarded 'warm fuzzies' to add to their badge, but anyone who was less than manic would be given a 'cold prickly'.Another reason for hating Woolworth's is that they were the Tesco of their time, driving small shops out of business by providing a one-stop-store with cheaper prices. But in spite of all this, do they deserve to go bust?The commercial below is, I think, from 1980, when Woolworth's were at the height of their powers. They were the major retailer in Britain - the only high street store with the audacity and clout to feature so many A and B-list celebrities in their two-minute commercials. There's Derek Nimmo, Tim Brooke-Taylor, 'Diddy' David Hamilton, Anita Harris (C-list, even then) Magnus Pike, Jimmy Young, Ed 'Stewpot' Stewart, Leslie Crowther and Kenny Everett, to name a few, and strangely, they had much more kudos than their equivalents in today's celebrity-obsessed age.What do you want for Christmas?

{"title": "Don't let me die in Bexhill", "date": "Sunday, November 23, 2008", "text": "As I have written in another post, Bexhill-on-Sea is one of those purgatorial, coastal towns where people go to die. It is a suburb without a city, in which the only sounds you will hear are seagulls, repeats of Inspector Morse, the slurping of thin, watery soup and the high-pitched drone of a pensioner driving at 27mph in first gear. People move here for the sea air, or so they say. I suspect that the real reason is that Bexhill induces a frame of mind that makes death a welcome release from the tedium of living there.But Bexhill (which I visited yesterday) is also home to the De La Warr Pavilion - Britain's first public Art Deco building - which houses a superb gallery and cafe. As the building faces the sea, you can turn your back on Bexhill and enjoy views like these:It is remarkable how the presence of one decent public building can transform a town, offering some hope of redemption. In a secular age, we desperately need places which are accessible to every member of a community. In most towns, this will mean visiting a shopping mall, cinema or leisure centre. Few are lucky enough to enjoy a really well-designed civic building that isn't owned by a corporation with a commercial agenda.Walsall is generally regarded as one of the most appalling places in Britain. It enjoys the dubious accolade of being the fattest town in the country and, I suspect, also tops the league for teenage pregnancy. A few years ago an art gallery was opened slap bang in the middle of Walsall, replacing one that the local council had closed ten years earlier. Some people questioned the wisdom of spending £21,000,000 on an art gallery in such an unreceptive environment, but this is missing the point. Even if people can't see the point of art, if you give them a decent public building they will use it.I think it's safe to say that not many of Walsall's residents will be enticed by a current exhibition which 'takes the figure of the angel as a starting point for an exploration of Blake's ideas about the body and spirit', but they may use the gallery as a place to meet and have a coffee and who knows, curiosity might entice them to look at some of the art.The key is to create exciting, non-commercial spaces that aren't intimidating and give everyone in the community a sense of ownership. Also, it's vital that these places are built in the heart of the town.What I love about the De La Warr Pavilion is its accessibility. I took my children there yesterday and after parking the car, we were able to go straight down to the beach, where we explored rock pools and found seashells. A short flight of steps took us up to the Pavilion and as we entered the main foyer, there was no awkwardness about bringing slightly sandy boys into the gallery. Indeed, with its comfortable sofas and art books, it was a home from home.I wouldn't want to live or die in Bexhill, but thanks to the vision of the people behind the De La Warr Pavillion, I will be a frequent visitor."},
{"title": "Novel ideas", "date": "Thursday, November 20, 2008", "text": "There's an interesting article in the Bookseller, claiming that literary agents are 'struggling to sell début and literary fiction, with novels taking longer to sell to publishers and more failing to find a buyer at all'.I can't say I'm surprised. The sales figures for new hardback literary fiction have never been great and since the demise of the Net Book Agreement, the situation has got worse: if a novel isn't price promoted then it's hardly worth taking it out of the box.The hardback fiction table used to be the jewel in the bookseller's crown. It would always occupy the prime position on the shop floor, whilst (with a few exceptions) non-fiction titles would be tucked away in dimly-lit nooks. Sordid little publications like celebrity memoirs were usually displayed upstairs, preferably spine-on.Then a number of things changed. First, new high-tech stock control systems taught booksellers that the latest Milan Kundera novel was no.67 in their top 500 titles, whilst a diet book by an Eastenders actor they'd never heard of was no.8. Second, the book trade was invaded by people who knew nothing about books and were only interested in what was selling. Third, Margaret Thatcher and her cohorts redrew the ideological map of Britain, replacing quality with quantity. Fourth, the end of price fixing widened the gap between the bestsellers (or 'superlead' titles as some publishers like to call them) and the less commercial books.These factors have created a climate in which publishers and booksellers are less inclined to take risks and the end result is not fewer and better books, but a lack of innovation.Twenty years ago, a publisher could justify printing a new literary novel by an unknown author on the grounds that they believed that X had great potential and in three or four novels' time, would achieve critical and commercial success. In the meantime, X's loss-making novels were effectively subsidised by the bestselling titles. There was also a view that even if X wasn't a commercial success, they added credibility and prestige to a publisher.To some extent that view still prevails and publishers do take risks with new, unknown authors. However, today it is rarer to see writers indulged in the way they used to be and unsuccessful authors risk being dropped before they have really found their voice.What can be done? One answer would be to stop publishing new fiction by unknown writers in hardback, as readers are more likely to buy a £7.99 paperback than a £20 hardback. Publishers don't like doing that because the critics generally ignore paperbacks, but if enough new writing was published in this format then hopefully the reviewing culture would change.As a bookseller I felt like Brian Hanrahan when it came to new hardback fiction titles that were sold at full price: I counted them in and I counted them out. No sales, plus the cost of sending the titles back to the publisher, who'd either remainder them or have the books pulped. If the rest of the shop had been run on this basis, we would have gone out of business within months.However, publishing in paperback isn't enough. Unless a new writer is lucky enough to receive fantastic reviews or the endorsement of a book club, they will still struggle to reach the reading public. If publishers and booksellers truly believe that new titles are worth stocking, the reader needs to know why. Bunging a new novel in the latest 3 for 2 promotion will just mean that X is lost in a crowd of more familiar names. I'd like to see the traditional hardback fiction table replaced by a selection of the new and unfamiliar.I also wonder if the book trade is too busy chasing the zeitgeist, looking for the next Da Vinci Code/Bridget Jones/Harry Potter when they should be trying to find the best new writing. I don't know. I'm not a publisher and my knowledge is anecdotal, gleaned from years of listening to sales reps complaining about being asked to sell the unsellable.It all sounds rather bleak, but I would argue that this is a fantastic time to be a reader. The culture of blogging and easy availability of out of print and cheap books on the internet has created a vibrant new reading culture in which titles are promoted soley on merit. It is the ultimate free market: democratic, unregulated and borderless, presenting many opportunities for authors to connect directly with readers. If new writers are having trouble getting published, then it isn't necessarily the end of the story. Veni Vidi Blogi!"},

{"title": "A sense of place", "date": "Saturday, November 15, 2008", "text": "Earlier this year a local man called Paul Wheeler was knocked down and killed by a car as he wheeled his bike across a busy road. The death sent shockwaves around the town, as Wheeler was the 'archbishop' of the Commercial Square Bonfire Society, but to relative newcomers like me, it was just another name I'd never heard of.I realised that whilst I lived in Lewes, I was not a Lewesian.The centre of Lewes was packed during Paul Wheeler's funeral and although I felt conscious of being an outsider, I was glad to live in a town where individuals still mattered. The fact that Lewes could come to a standstill (with huge traffic delays) because people wanted to celebrate the life of a friend, reminded me why I moved to Lewes in the first place.Recently, the magazine  Viva Lewes published an extract from a tribute to Paul Wheeler that was written by a local artist called Peter Messer. I found it extremely moving. Messer's prose could, at times, have been written by Orwell or Betjeman and although you may find it nostalgic and sentimental, it encapsulates the spirit of Lewes: a town which still has a mind of its own and, in Sussex dialect, won't be druv by politicians or big business.Here is an extract from Peter Messer's tribute:We were neighbours for over ten years, good friends for many more and for seven years we shared an allotment (plot of land, for non-British readers) in Paddock Road. On the Sunday morning I'd heard he died, I was planning to meet him. The ritual never varied much; five minutes after the Archers' theme tune died away, Paul would turn up and we'd spend a quarter of an hour discussing the week's events in Ambridge. There'd be a bit of work, a bit of a chat, a bit more work, a rant, some weeding, some harvesting for Sunday dinner then a full five minutes' gloating self-satisfaction at what we'd achieved before adjourning to the Gardener's Arms.Paul was a romantic and an escapist but a practical one. Instead of just dreaming about the atmospheres, artifacts and customs of the past, he recreated them as much as possible in his everyday life. He found much of contemporary life tawdry and alienating and he railed at its emptiness, yearning for something simpler, more essentially human, where comradeship and community meant more than social position and personal gain.A life that revolved around good beer and food, and good friends and neighbours suited him down to the ground. Anyone lucky enough to have spent a Boxing Night with Paul and Dawn will have gained a brief insight into the things they felt to be important. No electric lights, just an intimate glow from a couple of oil lamps glinting from below his beloved old enamel signs, hung with plain holly and ivy from the allotment. Endless talk and laughter, drink and good homemade food over a background of hit songs from the forties.If there is such a thing as heaven...I imagine Paul's as a kind of idealised cross between Lewes and Brighton in the 1930s, full of steam engines and coal smoke, advertisements for Kolynos Toothpaste, Robin Starch and Keatings Flea Powder. A heaven of thriving hot-metal printworks, manufacturers, bakers, brewers and other industries called Royal-this and Empire-that, with pie and mash shops, the Brighton Belle and Max Miller at the Hippodrome for One Night Only.Bank Holiday cycle tripes out to rural pubs and tea-rooms, behind which stand the Downs, covered with Southdown sheep and seagulls forever following the plough. Steam-driven fairground gallopers, Harvest Homes and the singing of old songs. The pubs all full of dark wood and engraved mirrors, billycock hats, pipe smoke and pianos.And if you heard laughter coming from inside, you'd certainly know the one Wheeler was in! Paul was an English Man with all that entails, but essentially he was a Sussex Boy. You can be a hundred years old in Sussex and still be a boy."},

With the callousness of youth, I remember feeling quite cheated. I'd bargained on getting a few pounds to spend on my collection of Marvel comics. Instead, I inherited two boring old medals which weren't even worth enough to sell.Later, when I learned about the First World War, I realised that the medals were priceless and understood what my grandfather had endured to earn them. At an age when he should have been learning a trade, he joined up and spent two years being shelled, shot at and gassed. When he returned to civillian life, he was only able to find work as an unskilled labourer. Working class soldiers were merely canon fodder and in 1918, there was no talk of 'a land fit for heroes'.Among the photo albums my grandparents left are two collections of postcards from the First World War. Most of them were made in Britain, but there were also quite a few produced by enterprising Parisians, like this one:I have several other 'Sketches of Tomm'ys' life and it's quite striking how cynical they seem compared to some of the more maudlin, sentimental British postcards:Cards like the one above were very popular, usually sold in a set of four, featuring the lyrics from a popular song of the time. They make a stark contrast with images like this:What's striking about the picture above is the fact that this harrowing image is an official photograph. I would have thought that this graphic depiction of modern trench warfare wouldn't provide much reassurance to the families of soldiers, but maybe people took comfort from the fact that 'our boys' were able to deal with anything the Hun threw at them.In my ignorance, I had no idea that there were Indian Knights of the Realm in those days. I like General Joffre's uniform. Apparently, when he was made Commander-in-Chief of the French forces, he'd never commanded an army in his life, which probably explains why he was so rubbish.I love this postcard.

Spend too little on public services and your citizens will leave the city to escape from escalating crime rates and poor health care. Spend too much and people will still leave, as the economy is buggered.Yesterday I decided to test the two presidential hopefuls' policies in Sim City, establishing one city for each candidate.Here is the John McCain city:As you can see, the city is has been ravaged by terrorism and environmental problems. I can also see signs of a UFO attack, which would suggest that McCain isn't just content with alienating other countries. In the McCain city, there are plenty of employment opportunities for the emergency services and the military, but overall there are very few jobs available for the average citizen.There were many theories about what the mysterious bulge was on the left side of McCain's face, including one suggestion that it was Lord Voldemort. Sim City doesn't provide an answer, but in our simulation McCain is now dead and Sarah Palin is talking about the 'end times'.Now here is the Barack Obama city:This city enjoys full employment, resulting in a low crime rate and a bouyant local economy. President Obama's enlightened foreign policy has guaranteed freedom from attacks by terrorists and instead a pursuing a new Cold War, the USA is working with the major powers to tackle climate change and develop a base on the moon for peaceful research.As you can see, there is a good balance between civic spaces and commercial buildings, making this a very desirable place to live. The widening gap between rich and poor is now narrowing, thanks to Obama's prudent fiscal policies.So there you have it: a conclusive computer simulation that will hopefully help the good people of America make the right choice tomorrow.God Bless America."},

You let someone have a sabbatical and instead of coming back to work with renewed commitment, they hand in their notice. I blame the critics. If they'd panned David Tennant's stage performances, perhaps he would have decided to stick to gurning his way through another season of Doctor Who.The selection of a new Who is a cultural event that, in Britain at least, far eclipses the election of a new Pope. The choice is nearly always surprising, but usually makes sense once the actor has settled into the role.Who, in a million years, would have picked leather-jacketed Mancunian Christopher Ecclestone? He didn't even lose his accent. But somehow he carried it off, and as for the contemporary dress, I like to think that I was the original inspiration for this, following my little-known period as John Pertwee's assistant during the 1990s:(This photo was the result of one of those serendipitous moments when you happen to be in the right place at the right time. In this instance I was walking through Hammersmith on a Sunday morning, feeling slightly the worse for wear, when I passed a hotel that was staging a Doctor Who convention. I sneaked in and ended up having a photo taken with the charming John Pertwee!)I have no idea when the successor will be announced (and frankly, I can wait), but several names have been bandied around. A strong favourite is Patterson Joseph, who appears as Johnson in Peep Show. There has never been a black Doctor before and he would be an excellent choice. Another name mentioned is Julian Rhind-Tutt, who would also fit into the role nicely.It is also traditional for completely inappropriate actors to be suggested as possible relacements. The wild card this time is James Nesbitt, who surely lacks the necessary otherwordly qualities. A few years ago there was talk of giving the role to the estuary-accented, floppy-haired biter of homeless people's ears, Alan Davies, which would have been a disaster.But perhaps the most controversial suggestion of all is the possibility that Doctor Who could be played by a...woman!I actively embrace equality of the sexes in all fields, but I must draw the line at Doctor Who. He might have two hearts, but in every other respect he is a bloke. He likes gadgets, is emotionally stunted, keeps getting lost because he won't ask for directions and seems to wear the same clothes for several days at a time.

This comes on top of a compulsory uniform (sorry, dress code - the word uniform is apparently frowned on in Waterstone's), mystery shoppers, restricted access to proof copies and the introduction of a course called Get Selling (because those airy-fairy booksellers don't know how to sell books).My ex-colleague added that they'd read on book on Nazi Germany a few weeks ago, and were struck by the parallels with Waterstone's. It was a slightly melodramatic comparison. As far as I know, Waterstone's haven't started exterminating Ottakar's booksellers yet, but I could see that the combination of inefficiency, obsession with efficiency and intolerance of dissent all sounded horribly familiar.I used to want to hear what was going on in Waterstone's and bookselling in general, but this time something had changed.

It is not on the same scale as November 5th, but in many ways it's far more enjoyable and is, as the League of Gentlemen would say, a local procession for local people:There are so many things I enjoy about the Lewes bonfire processions: the noise of the drums, the heat of the flaming torches as they go past, the cavalier attitude towards health and safety, the feeling of anarchy the grips the town, the sound of burning wheelbarrows as they rattle down the hill, the eclectic mixture of costumes and the unpredictable choice of music.Is it any surprise that the God of Hellfire himself - Arthur Brown - lives in Lewes? Only last year, he managed to set fire to his hair (again) at a local concert. Ideally, I would like to see every procession end with a performance of Fire:"},
{"title": "Rye", "date": "Tuesday, October 21, 2008", "text": "One of the great pleasures in life is sitting in a pub, enjoying a pint with someone you've known for years. When I lived in Twickenham, I took it for granted that I would see a particular friend at least once a week and without fail, we'd go through the same routine of drinking five pints of Guinness, followed by minor acts of vandalism towards the unsightly cluster of estate agents' signs that littered the communal garden outside my flat.(Once I was caught by a policeman, halfway through the act of pulling up a 'For Sale' sign. He beckoned me over and said 'Now sir, we all know that estate agents are the lowest form of life, but I'd still like you to put that sign back.' What a gent)I assumed that our weekly drink would continue until one of us died, but one day my friend decided to quit his job in the City and move to Kent. Apart from a couple of meetings in London, we saw little of each other and I wondered if we would eventually lose touch.Then, a couple of years after moving to Lewes, I discovered that if we both left our houses at a similar time and caught trains to Rye, we'd arrive within minutes of each other. Several years on, Rye is now home to our new 'local' and we meet several times a year. I was there yesterday and, several pints later, came perilously close to buying a ukulele in a charity shop.However, to get to the point...If you haven't visited Rye, it's worth making a special journey. It is a beautiful, medieval town that is almost completely unspoilt and also has strong literary connections.  Henry James spent the last 18 years of his life at Lamb House which, annoyingly, is only open on Thursday and Saturday afternoons. As writers' houses go, it's a little disappointing as so much of the property is off limits, but it is still worth a visit.However, Lamb House also has other literary associations. EF Benson and his brother lived there in the 1920s and it became Mallards in the Mapp and Lucia novels. I am ashamed to say that I've never read Benson's books, but I watched the brilliant Channel Four adaptation and loved it.Rumer Godden also lived at Lamb House for a few years, before moving to another part of Rye and set In This House of Brede in the local area. Once again, I haven't read the book, but the film's great. Any movie with the beautiful Judi Bowker and Diana Rigg dressed up as nuns can't be bad.Rye has also been home to Joan Aiken, Dr Syn author Russel Thorndyke, Radcliffe Hall, Spike Milligan, Macolm Saville ( author of The Gay Dolphin Adventure - now sadly out of print) and Conrad Aiken, father of Joan.Today, Rye's literary tradition is alive and well. John Ryan, author of the Captain Pugwash books lives and works in Rye. This is apt, as Rye is one of the Cinque Ports and has a strong nautical tradition, even if the town is now several miles from the sea.However, the greatest writer living in Rye today must be Samuel Youd, aka John Christopher, the author of The Death of Grass (which is being reissued by Penguin next year). He is now 86 and I hope that he will live long enough to witness the resurgence of interest in his novels.So that's the end of my pitch for Rye. If the local tourist board would like to send me a small token of their appreciation, I am open to offers as long as it doesn't involve those other famous residents of Rye, the Cheeky Girls."},

Born Gerald Hugh Tyrwhitt-Wilson in 1883, Berners went to Eton and worked as a diplomat until he inherited his title. For the remainder of his life, he devoted his energies to painting, composing and writing.Lord Berners was arguably too much of a dilettante to achieve greatness. However his music was well received and he had several commissions for film scores, including the 1947 version of Nicholas Nickleby. He also privately published a novel called The Girls of Radcliff Hall, which featured him and his friends as schoolgirls.Berners was openly gay. He was famous for his collection of doves, all of which had been dyed pink, and his social circle included Cecil Beaton and Frederick Ashton. He made Noel Coward look positively butch.In spite of this, Berner's mother seemed blissfully unaware of her son's homosexuality and was horrified to hear that he'd been spotted 'stepping out' with one of the most notorious society lesbians in London. Concerned that Berners was risking both a broken heart and his reputation, his mother pleaded with him to publicly disassociate himself from this woman.Berners agreed and place the following announcement in the Times:Lord Berners wishes to announce that he has left Lesbos for the Isle of Man."},

There were no discernible sections and it was impossible to look at any of the books without causing an avalanche. Also, the stock was pretty awful.It felt as if the owner had given up and was now simply going through the motions of opening and closing the shop. Needless to say, there were no customers.I almost felt like offering my services (free of charge) for a day or two, but I don't think the owner would have taken kindly to having a stranger criticise his shop, followed by a patronising offer of help.

I'm very proud of him because he is dyslexic and hasn't had an easy time at school (in fact he's had an awful time) and an achievement like this will help to boast his self-esteem. I was particularly pleased to see that he'd been awarded a certificate:'Team Read'. Right on, kids. Books are cool!I found the illustration quite amusing. It's as if the artist was so keen to represent minorities that he forgot to include anyone from the majority. Where are the fat white kids with shoddy Primark clothes and Elizabeth Duke bling?But although the certificate may be a little cringeworthy, it's great that so much is being done to encourage children to read. Most children I know have met at least one author at their school and there seems to be much more of an emphasis on reading and talking about books than there was when I was being beaten and flogged by sadists and perverts.I probably have a distorted view of things. As a bookseller I only met the children who were interested in reading;  not the shell-suited offspring of crack addicts and recidivists. However I was heartened by the sheer number of children who visited the shop. For example, when I worked in Crawley (a solidly working-class new town) I organised a Jacqueline Wilson signing and was amazed to see the town centre bought to a virtual standstill, with a queue that was a quarter of a mile long. I will miss that side of bookselling.However, I am enjoying watching my son gradually gain the confidence to start reading books on his own. It was quite a struggle getting him to take the plunge, but my wife won him over with some brilliant books by Shoo Rayner which were perfect for reluctant readers. He has now moved on to Horrid Henry and I hope that the Secret Seven will follow shortly. I'm not going to bother with any worthy books for a year or two.Who would have predicted that in 2008, books would still be central to the lives of so many children."},
{"title": "Meltdown", "date": "Tuesday, October 14, 2008", "text": "As they would say on Armstrong and Miller, 'Pru, it's kicking off!'I can't say I'm particularly surprised that Britain and the USA are on the brink of economic collapse, but it's shocking to see some of the more financially prudent nations experiencing difficulties.Today's BBC News website reported that Germany is about to enter a recession. That's not good news (remember what they did last time). Even Switzerland is making contingency plans for nationalising its main banks. But the spotlight is on poor old Iceland.I like Iceland. I went there two years ago and immediately felt a strong affinity with the landscape and its people. I did wonder how a country that had endured centuries of poverty could suddenly become so affluent, but I put it down to cod and Bjork. It never occurred to me that a nation that produced Magnus Magnusson could possibly be responsible for any financial irregularities.There are many jokes about Iceland and the credit crunch - usually on the theme of freezing assets - but my favourite is this:Q - What's the capital of Iceland?A - About £3.50I hope that Britain and Iceland are able to reach an equitable agreement, as I want to be able to return there without being lynched by angry fishermen and pop stars. Also, it seems quite wrong to make the Icelandic people suffer for the actions of a small minority.On the plus side, at least the economic downturn is now out in the open. I felt more pessimistic a month ago, when food and fuel prices seemed to be on an upward trajectory. Rice - once the staple element of a cheap, student meal - doubled in price. A couple of cod fillets nudged past the £5 barrier. But the worst offender was the price of chicken:This isn't an organic chicken. It's not even a free range one (and no, it's not an M&S chicken). It's just a normal chicken which Tesco - anxious to appease the middle classes who watch Hugh Fearnely-Whittingstall on Channel Four - have decided to rebrand with a reassuring photo of a Nazi war criminal. Tim Payne obviously isn't a war criminal, so why is the photo so scary? As for the text, although it has a friendly, non-corporate font, it is quite clear that poor old Tim is living in serfdom. I doubt if he gets a square deal.However, as much as I hate Tesco, I must give them credit for responding to the financial meltdown with some 'recession-busting' (their phrase) offers. I can now buy an abused chicken for £1.99. Tesco's 'Value' pitta bread is 26p and you also can buy unripe avocados for 50p. In short, the supermarkets have responded to the credit crisis by tiering their prices so that people on low incomes aren't completely buggered. I'd rather support my local shops and farmers' market, but I am completely skint.Having no money is a little depressing, but on the plus side I am relatively recession-proof. I don't have any credit card debts, my mortgage is fairly modest and I don't even have a job to lose. When you've hit the bottom, the only way (I hope) is up.I have a plan. I am busy training for a new career and if there are any jobs left next year, I hope that I shall be able to find work that is fulfilling and rewarding. I am studying web design and proof reading, in the hope that it will lead to some sort of web master/editor/designer job. I never want to work in a shop again, even if it sells books."},
{"title": "The moment of truth", "date": "Sunday, October 12, 2008", "text": "This morning I went to Brighton, where I had an appointment to meet someone at 9.00. I arrived ridiculously early and wandered aimlessly for half an hour. It was like being in a zombie movie. The streets were deserted, but I could sense the presence of other people. Occasionally I would turn a corner and see someone in the distance staggering home from a club. There were also a few homeless people, shivering in the cold, damp, autumn air.I crossed the road and saw that I was near Waterstone's. The shop wouldn't be open for at least two hours, so I decided to have a peek. Seeing the windows, which were full of celebrity biographies and children's annuals, I realised how glad I was to be out of bookselling, particularly Waterstone's.This isn't Brighton Waterstone's - I just like the photoI carried on walking, cutting through one of Brighton's many side streets. The only people I saw were a stunningly beautiful girl in a flowing, boho chic outfit and a gaunt, raddled-looking woman wearing a filthy tracksuit. The age gap between the two women was probably negligible, but the second woman looked 20 years older, thanks to a combination of substance abuse and sleeping rough.I passed a scrunched-up piece of exercise paper, lying on the top of a low wall. I opened it and saw the words 'I HATE MY DAD' next to a crude image of a body with a bloody knife stuck in it.A transexual cycled past wearing a short skirt and fishnet tights. He had a thick, black, bushy beard and I wondered why he'd decided to keep the facial hair. It was an odd look, but at least it was striking. It's hard to make anyone in Brighton bat an eyelid these days, but I'm sure that he managed to turn a few heads.I passed a shop window and looked inside to see what they were selling. A really boring-looking man kept staring at me, so I decided to look away. As I turned my head, he turned his and pretended not to look at me, but as I tentatively turned my head back towards the window I could see that he was doing the same thing. Why couldn't he just piss off and mind his own business? I don't know why but I instinctively felt a deep antagonism towards him.Then I realised the horrible truth.I was looking at my own reflection."},

{"title": "Karping on...", "date": "Monday, October 06, 2008", "text": "As you may have gathered, I have become a big fan of the American novelist David Karp. His novels One and Leave Me Alone were a revelation, and I find it inexplicable that his books are out of print.I used to think that you could find anything on Google, but apart from a short Wikipedia article and a couple of obituaries from nine years ago, it is as if Karp has been wiped off the face of history. To achieve that level of obscurity as a writer you normally have to be pretty crap, or piss off your publisher so much that they effectively kill off your career. One publisher allegedly did it to one of their authors - a moderately successful female crime writer - and I haven't seen a book by her in 15 years.We know (or at least, I think) that there's no questioning Karp's ability as a writer, so was he a bit of a tosser? Not if the following extract is anything to go by. It took me a long time to find this article and I apologise for the lengthy quote, but it's a nice story:Do you recall David Karp? Fine writer. Won a Guggenheim back in '56. Nobody remembers that. Well, Karp got into TV writing and production when the paperback market went soft. He did some stuff for Playhouse 90 and The Untouchables. Won an Emmy, I'm pretty sure, for an episode of The Defenders.Anyway, back in 1970 he adapted his own novel, Brotherhood of the Velvet, into a TV movie for Glen Ford. It was a conspiracy flick. A little cheesy but still ahead of its time. I was 10 years old when it broadcast and, for whatever reason, it made a big impression. So I wrote Karp a fan letter and, shockingly, he wrote back. Can you imagine that? He's a big TV writer at this point and he takes the time to write to this pre-teen punk in a factory town back east. So we had a little correspondence going for a few months--I told him, I confessed, that I wanted to be a novelist. He sent me a mint copy of The Last Believers that I still have.Well at some point I started writing him a letter and I got a little sidetracked and began rambling about an idea I had for a dramatic television series. I had gotten hold of a little pamphlet written by D.C. Fontana, I believe, that detailed, essentially, how to write a pitch. Useful little document. So in this letter to Karp, I started pitching this notion I'd been cradling for a year or so. This idea I'd been hatching on long winter walks home from school. It was just nuts, really an off-the-wall thing. But what happened was the letter ballooned into this 60-page monster. I had to mail it in a manuscript envelope, right? About two weeks go by and suddenly I'm mortified that I wrote this thing to Mr. Karp, that I embarrassed myself so profoundly to a flesh-and-blood writer. And I'm brooding over this shame one afternoon in the rocking chair of my yellow kitchen, pretending to read a Treasure Chest comic book. And my mother is at the stove, you know, making a meatloaf. And the phone rings. So Ma wipes off her hands on the dish towel and grabs the phone and talks for a second. Then she covers the receiver with her hand and looks at me suspiciously and says, \"It's a Mr. Karp for you.\"Can you imagine this?I'm ten, eleven goddamn years old. I almost dropped to the floor. I started shaking my head to refuse the call. But my mother, a stickler for doing the right thing and being polite, insisted I talk to this man. I think she thought it was someone's father or something. I remember this so clearly. So I take the phone and I sit down on the floor in the hallway and, terrified, I say hello. And Karp was just wonderful. Such a gentleman and quite funny. He said he'd read my series pitch and that he loved it and that he wanted to show it to some people. I swear to you, he even asked if I had representation. I didn't even know what that meant.So David Karp was not only a good writer, but a decent bloke too. If chaos theory is correct, then I hope that the tiny ripples of this blog will eventually grow into a proper Karp revival. In the meantime, I promise (well, almost) that I this will be the last time I rant on about David Karp."},

The dog is still called Timmy.Worst of all, they are a Disney franchise.At first I thought that the publisher had dared to change the names (and ethnicity) of the original characters in an attempt to make them more appealing to today's young readers, but I later realised that this Famous Five are, apparently, the children of the original members.This is a remarkable achievement, given that Julian, Dick, Anne and George were born in the 1930s. Perhaps they followed the example of one of my fellow Lewesians and had fertility treatment in their 60s.My son, who is eight, seemed more upset than I was. He loves Enid Blyton and although he is amused by the dated expressions, he accepts the stories on their own terms. He clearly felt patronised by the new, 'cool' Famous Five and I doubt that he would be impressed by the argument put forward by the books' creators that: The new Five is a fresh, modern concept which relates to audiences in a multimedia age. They are smart, cool and hip kids but like their parents they use their resourcefulness and survival skills to bring down the bad guys.How did this travesty come to pass?The answer is quite depressing. Apparently, the rights to many popular children's titles including the Mr Men and the complete Enid Blyton backlist are owned by a company called Chorion, who last year took over another company called The Copyrights Group. Here's a brief quote from a Chorion press release:The acquisition of Copyrights provides a significant expansion to Chorion’s already-robust brand portfolio, which includes properties such as Noddy, Mr. Men and the works of Agatha Christie and comes as Chorion prepares the major international launch of two new television series featuring Mr. Men and Enid Blyton’s Famous Five.'Already-robust brand portfolio'? How can anyone seriously write nonsense like that?It is rather sad that the rights to some of our best-loved children's books, including The Snowman, Paddington Bear and Beatrix Potter are in the possession of people who, in addition to making dull, self-important statements like the one above, are able to allow a much-loved series of adventure stories to be transformed into a commodity.How long will it be before Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has product placement by Nestle?I know that some would argue that Enid Blyton's novels aren't great literature, but that isn't the point. What I find offensive is the idea that children are unable to enjoy a work of fiction unless it is 'rebranded' in a contemporary setting. Chorion's cynical attempt to turn the Famous Five into a global franchise is particularly nauseating.Also, nothing dates faster than youth culture. Authors who try to pander to the latest fashions are effectively giving their books a sell-by date. Does anyone remember Richmal Crompton's William and the Pop Singers?Perhaps I'm just being a curmudgeon. However, if an eight-year old (who loves Pokemon and the Simpsons) also feels offended by this attempt to repackage a much-loved series of children's novels, then perhaps there is hope."},

{"title": "David Karp - the mystery deepens...", "date": "Saturday, September 27, 2008", "text": "A few days ago I finished David Karp's One - a novel about the role of an individual in a totalitarian society. It seemed to be heavily influenced by Nineteen Eighty-Four, but whether the author had read Orwell's book (which was published five years earlier) or not, I didn't feel that it diminished the integrity of Karp's vision. Why was this novel out of print?I discovered that David Karp had written six novels, but in his mid-40s, switched to writing for television. Why did Karp abandon books? Also, why was it so hard to find any information about David Karp on the internet? The logical explanation was that One was an accomplished, but derivative first novel, which was never equalled by its successors. I decided to put my theory to the test and read another Karp novel. Once again, Camilla's Bookshop in Eastbourne came up trumps:I am only a third of the way into Leave Me Alone, but so far it is excellent. Set in the world of publishing, this novel reminds me strongly of Richard Yates. Like Yates, David Karp has a gift for depicting the plight of the mildly talented, burdened with artistic sensibility and the painful, growing realisation of their own mediocrity.I'm absolutely certain that if it was reissued, Leave Me Alone would appeal to a new generation of readers. The Richard Yates revival shows that there is an appetite for this sort of fiction and the popularity of Mad Men clearly demonstrates how fascinated people are by the New York of 50 years ago.However, I'm not sure if any publishers read this blog. When I worked for Waterstone's I tried to keep a low profile in the book trade, as I knew that my employers were quite paranoid about blogs. Indeed, when one of my colleagues wrote a mildly critical comment on her blog about G.P.Taylor, she received a visit from the Waterstone's Human Resources department.Now that I'm a free man, perhaps I should write some inflammatory posts about people in the book trade to attract attention and, hopefully, bring authors like David Karp and John Christopher to the attention of publishers. I could mention how grumpy Terry Pratchett is (or how offensive some people find G.P.Taylor) and point out that bestselling children's author Lucy Daniels is actually two gay men in Notting Hill. I wouldn't bother saying anything about how obnoxious Jeffrey Archer is, as that would be no surprise to anyone. However, fans of Emma Blair might be shocked to learn that the good lady is a burly, Glaswegian gentleman who used to serve in the British Army. I could also mention how one publisher tried to sell the latest John Francombe novel to me on the basis that they'd 'changed the ghostwriter'.But would any of this make any difference?Probably not.In the meantime, I shall continue to read Leave Me Alone and I have also just received a copy of Sleepwalkers - a reasonable 4/- to all opponents of Base 10:I apologise if I seem to have a monomania (I love that word) about David Karp. I just can't believe that such an accomplished author is so unjustly neglected. If anyone can provide me with an answer, I'd be interested to hear it. In the meantime, read One!"},
{"title": "The David Karp revival starts here", "date": "Tuesday, September 23, 2008", "text": "Until I found this novel in the cavernous basement of Camilla's Bookshop in Eastbourne, I had never heard of David Karp. I can't remember why One caught my eye, but as soon as I read the blurb on the inside front cover, I was intrigued:'The publishers have bracketed this novel with Darkness at Noon, Nineteen Eighty-Four and Brave New World, which I at first thought presumptuous; but now, after reading it, I am inclined to agree.' - Cyril ConnollyThe rather worn copy on the shelf was priced £1, so I decided to trust Cyril Connolly and take a chance. I had reservations. If David Karp was that good, then why had I never come across his name in nearly twenty years of bookselling? I added One to my pile of unread books, only half expecting to ever get round to reading it.I have just finished reading One and although I wouldn't rate it as highly as Nineteen Eighty-Four, I was surprised at how good it was.I think it would be safe to assume that Karp had read Orwell's novel and was heavily influenced by it, as certain scenes in the book are strongly reminiscent of Winston Smith's encounters with O'Brien. If that it is the case, it doesn't diminish Karp's narrative. However, if Karp hadn't read Nineteen Eighty-Four, then it makes One even more remarkable.To give you an idea of the novel, here is a brief extract:'Do you know how long you must stay here now?'Yes, yes, forever, forever.'Only until you rid yourself of your heresies'Never. Never. I can never do it.'You will do it'I cannot.'You will or you will die here.'Then let me die soon.'You will die when you must. But not for a long time.'I will die sooner.'You will not. You will live out your life.'I can't do what you ask.'You must. Who told you you were brighter than your friends?'My father, my mother, my brother, my teachers, everyone.'They were wrong.'No they were right. I could see that.'They used the wrong measure of intelligence.'They didn't. They used the correct measure.'An intelligent man is a happy man, is he not?'No, he is not. My father was intelligent, but he was not happy.'Your father was not intelligent. The aim of life is happiness. Without happiness a life is without meaning.'The aim of life is reason. Without reason life is without meaning.'Would you rather be happy than rational?'A lunatic can be happy without being rational. You are all lunatics. The moon will change its phase and your madness will pass as happiness will pass. The dark side of the moon is coming and with it your unhappiness.Jeffrey Archer it ain't. Why isn't this novel more widely known?David Karp was born in New York City in 1922. In 1942 he joined the US Army and served in the Far East until 1946, when he left to continue his education. Karp wrote six novels in his 30s, but abandoned books for a screenwriting career, writiing scripts for series including The Untouchables. Karp's work in television was very successful and he won two Emmys.Other than this brief outline, and a short obituary published in the NY Times after his death in 1999, there is very little information on the internet about David Karp. I find this baffling.One is a very accomplished work of dystopian fiction and however derivative it may (or may not) be, it is far superior to many novels that are currently in print. Secondhand copies aren't difficult to get hold of, but I would love to see this reissued by Penguin, in their Modern Classics series."},

He was a proper Cockney and spent his working life as an unskilled labourer, but he wouldn't have dreamed of going out without a hat and tie:Compare him to today's old men and it is clear that sartorial standards have declined:How can the young be expected to behave well when their elders are setting such a bad example? Something has to be done; but what?I would like to see Britain's old men wearing tweeds, accompanied by appropriate hats and, perhaps, a meerschaum pipe. Obviously it would be wrong to force people to dress in this manner, but perhaps the Government could provide an incentive of some sort, like free Werther's Originals to anyone who conformed to the stipulated code.I would also encourage facial hair, however it would have to be stressed that an unruly beard full of dried soup would be worse than no beard at all. Ideally, a neat, well-groomed moustache would complement the country casuals perfectly.As for old ladies, I would like to see a return to sensible, muted tones and hats that looked slightly silly, in an endearing way. The garish coats with clashing colours, bought from mail order adverts in the Radio Times, would have to go. Facial hair, although common, would not be encouraged.In return for adopting a more dignified countenance, I would ensure that our elders were given the respect that previous generations of retired people enjoyed. It's a win-win situation.Apart from the death thing, I can't wait to be old. I would love to parade around town in a deerstalker and plus fours, spending my evenings reading by a log fire. 30 years seems an awfully long time to wait. Supposing I'm struck down by cancer before I even get a chance to pop down to the gentlemen's outfitters? I will feel cheated."},

As far as I was concerned, there were five kinds:The white mushrooms that you can buy in Tesco's and other supermarketsThe posh, unusual mushrooms that Waitrose sellThe unpleasant moulds that appear in damp housesAthlete's Foot'Recreational' mushroomsHowever, I now know that the world of fungi is infinitely more varied than I dared to imagine, as I have spent most of this weekend in a wonderful place called Wilderness Woods (I would recommend it to anyone living within a 50-mile radius of Hadlow Down, East Sussex).I visited Wilderness Woods in a mood of desperation, hoping that it would give my sons an opportunity to exhaust their seemingly endless reserves of energy. As far as I'm concerned, children are like dogs and need to be exercised at least once a day. The analogy ends there - dogs are much easier than children and show far more gratitude when you take them out (but just as you really start to care about them they die of old age - it's not a good arrangement).Wilderness Woods was a success. My sons were able to run around, build dens and let their imaginations run riot without any constraints. In the meantime, I became obsessed with the incredible variety of fungi that were present. I have seen toadstools before, but this was something different. Perhaps the appalling English summer - the worst on record - had been responsible for this amazing proliferation of mushrooms and fungi:Can you see a face in the mushroom above, or do I need to see my GP?There is something both beautiful and repugnant about mushrooms and fungi. I think the golden rule is that they're great in a woodland setting, but not so good on the genitals or feet.In the picture above, I can almost see the head of a mackerel. Can you see it, or have I been under the influence of the more magical members of the mushroom family?And now for the ridiculous. On the way home, we drove over the River Uck. The bridge we went across has, for many years, sported a sign that has been subject to petty vandalism, with local humorists adding an 'F' to the Uck. Eventually, the Highways Agency commissioned a customised sign that would leave no room for any vulgar consonants and for several years it seemed to work. However, where there's a will there's a way...Yes it's puerile, but it still makes me laugh and I find it touching that someone has gone to so much effort on this busy road. I'm still waiting for someone to convert Sussex Drive to Sex Drive."},

{"title": "Grey is the Colour of Hope?", "date": "Tuesday, September 09, 2008", "text": "I've been receiving some careers guidance recently and it has been very useful. Within four weeks I have gone from having no idea what to do with my life to being in a position where I am ready to start training for a new career. Best of all, this advice has been completely free.During my first session I completed a detailed questionnaire on a computer, which then produced a report saying that I should do a job that involves writing. It also said that the job I was least suited to was working in a shop. Oh dear. Were all those years in bookselling a waste of time?Today's session was meant to be in Lewes, but at the last minute it was changed to Newhaven. My heart sank.Although it is only eight miles from Lewes, culturally, Newhaven is on another continent, with a landscape that is unremittingly bleak. Once a thriving port, it is now a depressed town full of charity shops, boarded-up buildings and retail parks.The billboard says 'IS THIS IT?'. The answer, I'm afraid, is yes. The poster is crying out for some wag to add a SH to the last word.I arrived at midday. After parking my car I opened a door to a stairwell and was met by a stench of rancid urine. I decided to walk down the ramps instead and as I left the car park, was greeted by a dozen chavs sitting on a bench. I would have loved to photograph them, but I chickened out as I already have enough dental problems. They looked a lot rougher than the young men above and were busy playing with their pit bull terriers and drinking lager. One of them had a toddler in a pushchair.The people in Newhaven wore strange, shoddy clothes and were either obese or had that gaunt, drawn look that accompanies substance abuse. I contrasted them with the affluent, attractive, well dressed denizens of Lewes and thought of some of my friends who claim that class isn't an issue any more.This is the River Ouse, which is actually very pleasant a few miles upstream. Here the scene is one of desolation and looks more like one of the more obscure former Soviet republics. The ferry service to France still operates and I can only wonder what the French must think as they catch their first glimpses of England, which include an abandoned warehouse with smashed windows.A few miles to the east, the Cuckmere estuary is one of the most scenic places on the south coast. Sadly this part of the coast has been completely ruined. The muddy river banks are littered with traffic ones, shopping trolleys and scrap metal and the atmosphere is one of decay. There is talk of regenerating Newhaven and a block of swanky 'apartments' have been built by the seafront, but the town is also shortly going to be graced with an incinerator, pumping toxic fumes into air.What could be done to improve Newhaven, short of using atomic weapons? I don't know. There are some nice Victorian houses tucked away and perhaps they would attract a better mix of people if the town was redeveloped, but it would cost a fortune to really improve Newhaven. Vast tracts of land would have to be flattened and replaced with a mixture of parks and leisure facilities. Also, to convert the seafront from a decayed port to a vibrant coastal town would take years.But it would be worth it.I wouldn't like to visit Newhaven on a Friday night. I didn't feel particularly comfortable being there on a Tuesday afternoon and saw several people glare at me (was it the pink cravat?). However, I did see one smiling face that cheered me up:"},
{"title": "The Museum of Forgotten Lives", "date": "Saturday, September 06, 2008", "text": "One of the best things about Lewes is its Flea Market - a vast emporium of antiques and collectables housed in a large, converted Methodist Chapel. At first glance it seems a fairly typical antiques centre. However, the usual displays of jewellery, china, furniture and art are augmented by some very bizarre items, and the end result looks like a cross between a Mike Nelson art installation and a museum curated by a madman.The end result is both tragic and comic.On the one hand, it is hard not to be amused by the picture below: a dreadful, Boris Vallejo-esque depiction of the slaying of the Minotaur. The juxtaposition of this painting with a 1981 Royal Wedding souvenir tin adds to the absurdity of the scene. But there is perhaps an unintentional poignancy too, given the Greek tragedy of Charles and Diana's marriage.The scene below is also superficially comic, but I can't help wondering what the couple in the photo would have thought if they'd known that, 80 years later, their picture would no longer adorn the wall of a home, but sit behind a naked manikin waiting to be bought by someone who would probably just keep the frame.This is a studio portrait and it looks as if the couple are wearing their 'Sunday best'. Are they man and wife or father and daughter? I would love to know their story and find out how the picture came to be abandoned, but there were no clues on the back of the frame.There are several albums of photos from the 1920s and 30s, including one of a well-to-do couple on a cruise in the Mediterranean. Sitting in deckchairs, sipping cocktails, they look like characters from an Evelyn Waugh novel and it is sad that, within less than a century, they lie nameless and forgotten in an upmarket junk shop.Perhaps the oddest thing of all is this filing cabinet, which has two drawers with labels on which the word Holocaust is crossed out and replaced with 'car docs' and 'note books'.The Flea Market gives the visitor an archaeology of the human soul (pretentious, moi?), offering tantalising fragments of lost lives and bygone fashions. Many of its items are neither beautiful or useful and are probably doomed to remain unsold until they end up on a landfill site.I wonder what will become of us all, with our thousands of photos and countless possessions? We have produced more written material since 1945 than the in whole of human history, and even the largest bookshops can only stock a fraction of what is in print. I would at least like to think that in 200 years time, my descendants would have some record of my existence. However, my visits to the local rubbish dump and Lewes Flea Market don't fill me with hope."},
{"title": "Nun on the Run", "date": "Thursday, September 04, 2008", "text": "I am trying not to buy books at the moment, as my house is sinking into the ground. The ground floor is already like a basement flat and it is only a matter of time before I have to leave via the upstairs window. However, when you see books like this it's impossible to resist:I saw this in a charity shop last week and would have bought it just for the gaudy, sensationalist 1950s cover. It's an added bonus that this is a well-written, fascinating memoir of an extraordinary woman.Born in 1893, Monica Baldwin was the niece of the British Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin. In 1914, at the age of 21, she entered a convent and for the next 27 years was completely cut off from the outside world, apart from the occasional visit from 'Uncle Stan' and other family members. Baldwin was barely aware of the First World War and monumental events like the General Strike and votes for women passed her by.In 1941 she decided to leave her convent (sadly she doesn't say why) and this memoir is an account of her struggle to adapt to a society that had changed beyond all recognition. What makes it such a fascinating read is that Britain in the 1940s is almost as alien to her as is to us and she observes fascinating details that her contemporaries would probably regard as barely worth mentioning.Here is her account of a train journey:I studied my fellow travellers. There were some soldiers, rather red about the ears and smelling of beer and hot khaki, and two or three hatless young women with padded shoulders and purple nails. All had cigarettes between their lips. I had never seen a woman smoke in a railway carriage before. Their skirts were of a shortness which still shocked me a little; but then, my own were, after all, nothing to boast about, if it came to that. Staying with her aunt in Sussex, Baldwin is determined to get to grips with the modern world and spends her days either listening to the wireless or reading. Evelyn Waugh's Put Out More Flags  made her 'gasp and wonder what the world was coming to'.But I Leap Over the Wall isn't just an outsider's account of Britain in the 1940s. It's also, in the author's words, an attempt to 'write accurately and fairly about life in an enclosed convent' and counter some of the 'fantastically wrong ideas about nuns and convents'.Like too many good books, Baldwin's memoir is out of print (unless you include an expensive, hardback reprint). Fortunately, because this was a bestseller in its time, it's easy to obtain secondhand copies of I Leap Over the Wall from the usual sources. If you particularly want the wonderful Pan cover, look out for the 1957 paperback edition."},

It was a bold but masterly decision. Everyone loves Michael Palin and his affable, self-effacing temperament would be sure to win over any voters who were put off John McCain's belicose foreign policy. Also, with his extensive knowledge of different countries, Palin could help the Americans avoid the sort of gaffes that made George W Bush such a liability (remember his speech about the Pakis?).Later I discovered that it is another Palin who has been selected. In an attempt to woo both the far right and more militant Hillary Clinton fans, John McCain has picked an obscure Alaskan politician called Sarah Palin.She used to look like this:These days she has a more business-like image:Today, Sarah Palin is a respectable, 44-year-old 'hockey mom' of five, who also happens to be the State Govenor of Alaska. Like 99.99% of the world, I had never heard of her and wanted to learn more about this woman who could, potentially, become America's first female President.Here are ten things I've found out about Sarah Palin:She is a member of the National Rifle AssociationShe does not believe that global warming is caused by human activityPalin is pro-life, opposing abortion for victims of rape or incestShe has five children called Track, Trig, Bristol, Willow and Piper (named, I supect, after North Sea oil rigs)Palin is very religious and supports teaching creationism alongside evolutionShe opposes sex education in schools, prefering abstinence-only classesHer unmarried 17-year-old daughter is pregnantPalin is opposed to same-sex marriages or civil partnershipsShe opposes making polar bears an endangered species and wants Alaska opened up for oil explorationShe has been a state governor for two yearsOh dear.In an ideal world, the American electorate would choose Barack Obama. President Obama would be a force for good both in the USA and the world at large, helping to reverse the damage done by eight years of George Bush. However, the cynical part of me expects Obama to compromise with the more conservative forces in Washington (or run the risk of being assasinated) as Bill Clinton had to, but this would still be hugely preferable to having McCain in the White House.If elected, John McCain would be the oldest President of the United States and whilst he has displayed a tremendous amount of energy on the campaign trail, the fact remains that there is a very real possibility that he could pop his clogs whilst in office, leaving us with President Palin.That's a scary thought.I want to see a woman in the White House, but not this particular one."},

{"title": "Go East", "date": "Wednesday, August 27, 2008", "text": "I have said some very unkind things about East Anglia over the years, including a tasteless remark about melting ice caps and rising sea levels to someone who lived on the Suffolk coast. I'm not sure why I feel such  strong animosity towards the area as there are far worse places in Britain, but I think that the relentlessly flat landscape, Siberian winds and uninviting shingle beaches represent the antithesis of everything I enjoy about the countryside.However, I am unable to ignore East Anglia as my mother-in-law lives there. As I have mentioned before, she lives opposite a decommissioned nuclear power station. In her town, every other person seems to have had cancer and yet nobody ever suggests a link with the 'low-level' radioactive waste that was poured into the sea. They must be in denial.Last week I went back to East Anglia for a few days and decided to explore Suffolk. At first the signs weren't good: Welcome to Constable Country.Apart from the appalling idea of 'branding' a whole area, I don't like Constable's paintings and had no urge to see chocolate box scenes like The Hay Wain (which is remarkably unchanged since Constable painted the view). However, the landscape soon changed into a mixture of undulating hills, tranquil woodland and beautiful villages. I was completely unprepared for this and soon realised that I'd have to revise my opinions.I stopped at a village called Stoke-by-Nayland. It was barely a village, with just a handful of houses, many of which looked as if they were at least 500 years old. On the one hand I was impressed by this beautiful Tudor house:But it was impossible to disassociate this image from the idyllic scenes that feature in jigsaw puzzles, biscuit tin lids and calendars: This England. In reality, all too many English villages are largely made up of cheap, badly designed bungalows, inhabited by neckless locals who have been priced out of the decent houses by 'incomers'. That's progress.I walked to the local church and was amazed by its size. In Sussex, the Downland churches are generally very small and intimate in proportion to the villages they serve. However in Suffolk the tiniest village or hamlet can have a huge church:Apparently, Stoke-by-Nayland has a 'wool church' - in other words, a church that was financed by the boom in the wool trade during the fifteenth century.I love looking around old churches. Apart from the sense of history, they are a bullshit-free environment (if you discount the ultimate bullshit of believing in a non-corporeal creator of everything) in a world that has become demeaned by advertising and branding.However, although I'd like to claim an interest in ecclesiastic architecture, my main interest in village churches is the glimpses they give of life in the local community. This bulletin board highlights some of the local fundraising events and its star performers:What is Roy Tricker doing? It looks as though a particularly traumatic episode of constipation has reached its resolution, but perhaps he's just speaking in tongues.'A Talent to Amuse'? They may not be married but there is some sexual chemistry going on, isn't there?A big fish in a small stream?This photo looks as if it was taken in 1975.Ah, William Fry, the stalwart of the local amateur dramatic society. Who could forget his solo performance of Henry V in 1990, which raised £47.90 for the church roof fund?I mock, but in fact this was a stunningly beautiful area with an architectural embarrassment of riches. I had no idea that East Anglia contained these hidden gems and from now on, I resolve to be more open-minded."},

I can only hope that when Penguin republish The Death of Grass next year, there will be a renewed interest in Christopher's backlist.Without wishing to give too much of the plot away, the novel is about a group of people who are shipwrecked on a desert island in the Pacific and are disturbed to find creatures that appear to be malformed or mutated. The island clearly holds a secret and at first, the survivors plan to explore the mysterious, cloud-covered mountain that overlooks them. However, instead of pulling together they become increasingly distracted by power struggles and sexual tensions.If I had to describe Cloud on Silver in fewer than ten words, I say that it was like Lost meets Lord of the Flies. Indeed, the similarities to Lost are so striking at times, that I can't help wondering if any of the series' creators have read Christopher's novel. The random appearances of non-native species and the sense that the island itself is a living entity are common to both, although Cloud on Silver is ultimately more down to earth.John Christopher's novels place ordinary people in extraordinary situations, stripping away the veneer of civilisation to reveal the darker side of human nature. At times Christopher's vision seems excessively bleak, but to know what ordinary people are capable of we only have to look at recent history, particularly Bosnia and Rwanda.Cloud on Silver isn't literary fiction and it has many flaws, but the sum is greater than its parts and the novel is as prescient as it is dated. Christopher's views of gender, race and society are old fashioned, but we should not dismiss him for being a product of his time.Cloud on Silver would make a fantastic movie, although I suspect many people would mistakenly assume that it was a rip-off of Lost!"},
{"title": "Businessmen", "date": "Monday, August 18, 2008", "text": "What is it with businessmen? Every week I read the Sunday Times Business section in case there’s anything relevant to the book trade and invariably end up reading the profiles of top buisnesspeople. Even if I can’t be bothered to read the whole article, I always look at the inset that lists their favourite book, film and piece of music.    Without exception, the taste of our captains of industry is awful. It’s somewhat gauling to discover that someone who earns £700,000 a year thinks that Forest Gump is the greatest film ever made and likes reading Jack Higgins (when they’re not busy listening to Chris Rea). These are people at the top of their profession, so why are their intellectual horizons so limited? Even the managing director of Waterstone’s, Gerry Johnson, seems to know very little about books. You could argue that he doesn’t have to. He is an experienced retailer and doesn't need to be well-read to identify the priorities of running a national chain of shops. But I still find it strange that Britain’s largest book chain is run by a man who reputedly confused Kerouac’s On the Road with Cormac McCarthy’s The Road. What is the answer? I suspect that it lies in the personal qualities that make people succeed in the business world. Today’s top executives are largely 'Type A' personalities, not given to the sort of self-doubt or reflection that draws an individual towards philosophy and the arts. They may be highly intelligent, but somehow their critical faculties rarely compel them to question the meaning of what they’re doing.  I still find it hard to understand how anyone remotely intelligent can enjoy the latest Jeffrey Archer novel, but some people seem to compartmentalise different areas of their life.

I need a book to dip into while I sit with my youngest son as he watches CBeebies. Clark's acerbic memoirs seemed the perfect choice.The good thing about towns like Lewes is that you get a better class of cast-off. Most charity shops I've encountered sell an uninspiring selection of romance and thriller books, with clothes that you wouldn't even wear to paint the bathroom ceiling. In the charity shops of Lewes I can buy shirts that make me look unobtrusively patrician and browse a fiction section that is far superior to any branch of WH Smith (at the moment I'm reading a first edition hardback of Carol Shields' wonderful Larry's Party, bought for £1).I have already read most of Alan Clark's Diaries (Volume One), which is either a tribute to the book, or the sheer tedium of being with a small child. One of my favourite anecdotes is about the legless World War Two flying ace, Douglas Bader. Apparently Bader was asked to take part in a debate at a respectable girls' school and at some point during the proceedings, recounted one of the times when he was shot down over the Channel:'...And my engine was on fire, I had two of the fuckers on my tail, one fucker was coming up at me from  the left and there were two more fuckers about a hundred feet above me waiting for...' (At this point the headmistress panicked and interrupted. 'Girls, as of course you all know, there was a type of German aeroplane called the FOKKER.') But Bader: 'I don't know about that.

Nor did I realise that a fairly indifferent bottle of Pinot Grigio del Venezie normally sells for £7.99, rather than Tesco's incredibly generous half price offer of £3.99.Good old Tesco. My Tesco. Our Tesco, according to the posters outside the store. During a recent refit I was assured something along the lines of 'We are making your Tesco a bigger, brighter store.' I had no idea they had been nationalised.Criticising Tesco is, I realise, about as controversial as saying that the Holocaust was a bad thing and I don't want to single them out. From what I can see, several supermarkets are cashing in on the recession by expanding their long-established practice of hiking prices to make special offers seem more attractive.I have been trying to break free from the tyranny of the supermarkets by growing some fruit and vegetables, but as soon as everything starts going well, little buggers like these turn up:The one in the front's got a bit of an attitude, don't you think?

Aren't vouchers supposed to be as good as cash?WH Smith were questioned about this. Normally retailers witter on about terms and conditions before adding 'But on this occasion, as a goodwill gesture, we will refund the money in full'. However Smith's refused to budge, possibly concerned that any comedown would create a precedent.Smith's are dab hands at ripping off their customers with outwardly attractive offers that are, when you look at the small print, actually quite rubbish. In the lead-up to Christmas, customers were given free vouchers that promised £5 off with every £20 spent. It sounded good enough until you got out the electron microscope and read the terms and conditions:Offer excludes all CDs DVDs and Games, ie. XBOX 360, PSP, PS2, PS3, NDS, PC, GameCube, Xbox, GBA and Wii, and stamps , tobacco, gift vouchers, phone cards, e-gift cards, book tokens, Day Out Vouchers, Charity Products, iTunes, eTop-UP & National Lottery products. Cannot be used with any other promotional voucher or with customer orders. Only one voucher per transaction.But Smith's are no worse than their competitors. During my last few months at Waterstone's, I was under an increasing amount of pressure to sell the new electronic Waterstone's gift cards instead of National Book Tokens. I was told to remove the Book Tokens card spinner and peel off the stickers in the window that said we sold National Book Tokens. If customers asked to buy a voucher, I was told to sell them a Waterstone's gift card unless they specifically asked for a token.In an increasingly competitive retail environment, I can understand why WH Smith and Waterstone's have taken a more aggressive stance. Both companies are now more profitable, which would suggest that in the short term their policies are working. However, if they want survive in the long term and withstand the threat of increased competition from the internet and supermarkets, they need to treat their customers with a little more respect."},
{"title": "The Week it Rained Forever", "date": "Saturday, August 09, 2008", "text": "I have just returned from a caravan holiday in Devon. I use the term caravan loosely. In fact it was more like a building site portakabin, albeit a very comfortable one with plumbing, electricity and an en suite bedroom.On a list of desirable ways to spend a holiday, I must admit that a caravan holiday would normally be fairly near the bottom of my list, with only Pontins and East Anglia coming lower. However my efforts to find a cottage or hotel for under £500 during the peak season didn't meet with any success, so my options were limited to staying in a caravan or tent.The prospect of a week in a tent with my family seemed like purgatory at best. Hell if it rained. On the other hand I had many happy childhood memories of a caravan site in Devon. A quick search on Google confirmed that it was still there and charged around £400 a week for a four-berth caravan. Bingo! But there was one serious obstacle: my wife.Since I commenced my descent down the social ladder, my wife has become increasingly like Margot Leadbetter. I'm not entirely surprised. She grew up in a huge Tudor farmhouse and her family took it for granted that they had very few social equals on their island (my mother-in-law remembers locals calling her 'Miss Anne').  My wife is one of the least snobbish or materialistic people I've ever met, but everyone has their breaking point.When I suggested a caravan holiday, my wife looked at me as if I had suggested a very indecent act. Luckily I was prepared and played my trump card: 'This holiday isn't for us, it's for the boys'. I knew then that it was only a matter of time before she gave in.We enjoyed a traditional British holiday. It rained most of the time and our days were occupied with long car journeys to places where we would walk around, get bored and drive back to the caravan.If I had to pick five highlights from the holiday, they would be these (in no particular order):1. Model Railway Exhibition, ExmouthAlthough I have no interest in train sets, I love model railways and their utopian vision of an Ealing Comedies Britain that is stuck in the 1950s.This display was markedly different, containing dystopian elements that, had they been intentional, would have had Charles Saatchi  racing down the M4  ready to sign up the new Jake and Dinos Chapman. I particularly liked the Ceaucesceau-era social housing in this photo:If this display had been the work of an artist, it would have been acclaimed as a poignant work of social comment.2. The beach, SeatownI hate the naff tourist board signs that welcome you to 'Shakespeare country' and the whole of Lyme Bay has now been 'branded' the Jurassic Heritage Coast. If I was a kid who'd just watched Jurassic Park for the first time, I'd feel cheated. However the fact remains that this is an amazing stretch of coastline, with millions of fossils that predate the dinosaur age. In less than an hour I found the remains of an ammonite:I've no idea what this is, but it looks impressive:And these are Belemnites - the skeletal remains of an ancient variety of squid:If you want to feel a sense of awe, there's nothing like cracking a rock open to reveal the remains of a creature that has been hidden for hundreds of millions of years.3. Woodbury Castle:This prehistoric hillfort is sandwiched between two roads and there are no signs announcing its presence. I only discovered it by chance when I got lost during a walk and although I don't believe in ghosts, it had a very strange atmosphere. Historical sites usually betray the presence of visitors with the occasional wrapper and coke can, but this place seemed completely forgotten.4. DartmoorDartmoor is the largest wilderness in southern England and even in summer, it can be a harsh environment.  I climbed up this tor and felt a  great sense of achievement until I saw an unsupervised three-year-old higher up...Nestled in the middle of the moors is Widecombe, an idyllic village that has been almost ruined by tourism. Every shop seems to sell the same depressing selection of tea towels, mugs, kitsch figurines and naff postcards with an inebriated yokel on the front. However, the local church has a few gems inside:An elderly Welsh woman kept asking me questions about the church. I answered as well as I could and she thanked me. When I failed to answer her final question about the age of the church she looked a little put out. Apparently she thought I was the vicar.5. Lyme RegisOn the last day of our holiday the sun came out and the beach turned into WP Frith's Derby Day. I enjoyed watching people of all shapes and sizes making the most of the sunshine, wondering if this was their last chance to feel the sun on their skin until next year. Some people were reading books (I was very pleased to see a teenage girl reading Margaret Atwood), whilst others sunbathed, built sandcastles with their children or sat eating fish and chips.There was a play area for children manned by smiling young people in red polo shirts. Posters promised activities and prizes, but there was no mention of the fact that they were evangelical Christians. It seemed a little dishonest to lure innocent heathens into their bouncy tent under false pretences.There are two fairly decent secondhand bookshops in Lyme Regis and I managed to pick up an out of print Josef Skvorecky novel which I look forward to reading.Overall the holiday was a success. My sons really enjoyed it and my wife, to her surprise, said that she would consider going on a caravan holiday again. The only dissenting voice was mine, but I had to keep quiet because it was my idea."},

On the other side of the aisle I could see a woman in her 50s with a dyed, jet black perm that resembled a Brillo pad. I was struck by her skirt, which was made out of a thin, white, synthetic material with a print of purple cowboy hats on it. She was talking to a gaunt man in his 40s who looked as if he worked in a library. He spoke in a very camp voice, which made even the most innocuous remark sound like a witticism. She said something to him and he shook his head emphatically.'Ooh no, you don't want to be twirled around, do you?''I like Line Dancing, Foxtrot and Latin America.' She replied, in a faux genteel, but slightly 'common', London accent.'Ooh yes. Line Dancing's not too demanding. Mind you, there's that one where they hold their hands in the air. That one's outrageously energetic!''I don't think Ron's taught us that one yet''I bet you're in demand a lot''I always arrive early and have a soft drink first''Ooh good idea. Stoke yourself up''Yes'Their conversation was pure Alan Bennett and I frantically scribbled down as much as I could, but handwriting isn't my forte and I soon lagged behind. I wish I knew shorthand. Eavesdropping in public places is usually disappointing, particularly when it comes to listening to other people's mobile phone conversations. However, occasionally I come across a gem and love to speculate about the background to the people I'm listening to.The mark of a really good writer is someone who can create dialogue like this without making it sound like a crude, patronising parody. The last book I read that was absolutely spot-on about the strange combination of banality, passive aggressiveness, humour and occasional profundity that makes up a large part of human conversation was Patrick Hamilton's Slaves of Solitude. He must have eavesdropped on a few people to write such convincing dialogue. I wonder how he would have coped with today's mobile conversations...Yeah that's right babe...we're gonna relocate the whole operation...they're talking in the region of 300k...well, that's just a ballpark figure..."},
{"title": "Freaky Dancing", "date": "Sunday, July 27, 2008", "text": "A few years ago I was sitting in a local pub on a quiet Wednesday evening. A couple of tables away from me, an unassuming, middle-aged man sat alone, quietly nursing his pint.Someone walked over from the other side of the bar and put some money in the jukebox, which promptly started playing the Rolling Stones' Honky Tonk Woman. At this point, the solitary drinker (who bore an uncanny resemblance to Bamber Gascoigne) suddenly stood up and started dancing in a rather unusual, slightly robotic manner, without a trace of a smile on his face.This wasn't a drunken man having a laugh in front of a few mates. He was quite sober and didn't seem to be performing to anyone, so what was going on? Judging by the complete lack of interest shown by the other drinkers, this was a regular occurrence.The music stopped and the man promptly sat down. A few minutes later the jukebox began playing Give Me Shelter, at which point 'Bamber' calmly stood up and began dancing again.Later, I discovered that I had met the Lewes Dancing Man.Sadly I know nothing about this gentleman, except that he will dance to any music, any time, anywhere. In addition to dancing at pubs and gigs, he often gives little impromptu performances next to buskers.There are now several videos on YouTube featuring the Lewes Dancing Man including this one:The second video features a marvellous piece of street performance. Clearly the Lewes Dancing Man is a versatile individual and is as much at home with challenging, improvised contemporary jazz as he is with the Stones and Iggy Pop:I want to know more about this man."},

{"title": "United we stand...", "date": "Thursday, July 24, 2008", "text": "Yesterday's BBC News website had an interesting piece on a buying group for independent bookshops. Here's the link, but if you don't want to read the whole article, the gist of it is that a company called Leading Edge is giving independent bookshops a chance to buy their stock on terms that are comparable to those enjoyed by the chains.The terms that publishers give to retailers are shrouded in mystery, but like any relationship between a supplier and client, the more you buy the higher the discount. Independent booksellers usually get anything between 35 - 40% discount on the retail price, depending on the supplier. Waterstone's and Borders get around 48% on normal stock items, with an extra 10% thrown in if a title is part of a promotion.Publishers are particularly cagey about the terms they give to Amazon, British Bookshops and Tesco, but it wouldn't be unrealistic to suggest a figure in the region around 65 - 70% discount on the cover price. In the case of a £19.99 hardback, this means that Amazon can sell the book for half price and still make a few quid, whereas the independent bookshop would make a loss of several pounds if they tried to compete.I don't know how aware the general public are aware of the supply chain. In my experience, a lot of customers felt that we were ripping them off if we sold books at full price. A manager I used to know was told by a haughty customer that a book cost £3 less on Amazon. She replied 'Fine, buy it from Amazon, but don't complain in five years time when there are no bookshops left.' Chastened, he bought the book from her.I found life as a bookseller tough enough working for a chain. I certainly wouldn't fancy being an independent these days unless, like many of the most successful 'indies', I was in a town full of posh people who weren't bothered about saving money.Fortunately, independent booksellers are now able to fight back as members of a buying group which orders new titles from publishers in bulk, securing preferential trade terms. This gives an independent bookshop greater flexibility over pricing and makes the playing field a little more level (cliche no.572).Since I left Waterstone's I have discovered how many people hate the chains (I think they were too kind to tell me before) but resist paying full price in an independent bookseller, no matter how much they like them. Let's hope that the renaissance of the independents will get a new boost from initiatives like the Leading Edge's."},
{"title": "I have seen Treebeard!", "date": "Tuesday, July 22, 2008", "text": "As much as I like Lord of the Rings, I've always had a problem with the Ents. I could accept Hobbits, Orcs, Elves and even Gwaihir the Windlord, but the idea of walking, talking trees was too much for me. However today I think I saw a real Ent:I saw it on the  way to Chactonbury Ring - an Iron Age hill fort that is one of the most peaceful places I've ever been too. I discovered it nine years ago, when I walked the 100-mile South Downs Way. It was late morning and I was feeling gradually enervated by the heat of the hot July sun, when I turned a corner and saw a hill with a clump of beech trees on the top. I remember lying down in the shade of the branches, listening to skylarks. It was one of those rare moments when life felt perfect, but in spite of (or because of) this, I have never been back until today.Today I sat by a footpath that has been in use for thousands of years. I imagined medieval farmers, Roman legionnaires and Celtic tribesmen walking past me. I used to view myself as an interloper in the narrative - the descendant of Saxon invaders.  But now that DNA technology has shown that most people in Britain can trace their lineage back at least 20,000 years, I feel an even greater affiliation with the landscape.When I feel frustrated by Gordon Brown, overpopulation and the crassness of modern Britain, my instinct is to emigrate to somewhere like New Zealand. However I would miss that feeling of somehow belonging to a landscape, sentimental as that might sound. I'm torn between the urge to get out now while the going's good or moving to a more rural area in England. John Christopher would probably advise the former, as rural cottage owners didn't fare particularly well in The Death of Grass.Today, while I was sitting on the grass next to a field of poppies, I suddenly realised how few bees there were this year. Later I saw an advert in the Guardian for a book about the recent disappearance of bees. According to the blurb, this phenomenon didn't just mean shortages of honey and candles, but was actually a sign of imminent Armageddon. I started to panic and was quite relieved to spot this outside the local corner shop:"},
{"title": "Separated at birth?", "date": "Monday, July 21, 2008", "text": "Henning Mankell and Radovan KaradzicIt's uncannyUntil a couple of weeks ago, I only knew two things about Nina Bawden:She is a highly regarded children's author who has also written a few novels for adultsHer husband was killed in the 2002 Potter Bar rail crashI never expected to read any of Nina Bawden's books, but I recently picked up a second hand copy of her 1976 novel Afternoon of a Good Woman. The cover isn't great, but as soon as I saw the word magistrate I had to buy the book, if only to see if Bawden's portrayal of a middle-aged female JP is remotely convincing.I was expecting a fairly lightweight, middlebrow tale of middle class, middle aged angst in Middle England and was caught off guard by Bawden's understated prose, with its mixture of compassion, quiet despair and world weary cynicism. As Virginia Woolf said of Middlemarch, this is definitely a novel novel for grown-ups and whilst it may not be a masterpiece, it is an intelligent, perceptive and moving read.Afternoon of a Good Woman is still in print, but I wonder how many bookshops have a copy in stock? In the good old days of Waterstone's (i.e. when it was run by Tim Waterstone) we aimed to stock as wide a range of titles as possible. These days, even the larger branches of Waterstone's and Borders are extremely cautious when it comes to backlist. A few years ago I read Justin Cartwright's The Promise of Happiness and went to Waterstone's in Kingston to buy some of his other titles. They had one book in stock (even though Cartwright was part of the Richard and Judy selection). I moved on to Borders and found two titles.The culprit is EPOS. As soon as you have a computerised stock control system you realise how few titles actually sell. As I have written before, I did some work for the Ottakar's intranet and had access to three years' worth of sales data for the whole company. It was a revelation. I learned that modern classics like Cry the Beloved Country sold fewer than a dozen copies a year across over 100 shops.When I started in bookselling we probably stocked a lot of titles that never sold, but it was a fantastic shop! John Calder would regularly pop in to do a stock check and had carte blanche to order his entire list for us. I prided myself on stocking every novel by Trollope (nearly 50, I think) and our art section gave the Tate Gallery shop a run for its money.Obviously things had to change after the demise of the Net Book Agreement, but it is a shame that the only place I'll now find Nina Bawden's Afternoon of a Good Woman is in a second hand bookshop."},
{"title": "What next?", "date": "Friday, July 18, 2008", "text": "Two months ago I discovered that a bookshop was up for sale in Lewes. It seemed like a dream come true and the only obstacle in my way was the fact that I had bugger all money. Still, I had a house that could be used as security on a loan and if the business was viable, I would hopefully be able to earn a living and repay the bank within ten years.I met the owner and looked at the accounts. The sales had dropped during the last few years, but the business had become more profitable and I could see several ways of increasing the turnover.I started to visualise myself running the shop. In my head I'd redesigned the interior, held several successful author events and was becoming a local luminary. Yes, running my own business would be stressful, but would it be any worse than having to kowtow to someone I had no respect for? At least I'd be in control of my own destiny.I realised that I was talking myself into buying the shop and decided to get some objective advice from people who knew what they were talking about. They all said don't do it. I was given several good reasons which only a fool would ignore and reluctantly, I have decided to abandon my plans.Is this the end of my time in the book trade? I suspect that it probably is, which is a shame in some ways, however it could also be an opportunity to try something new. But what? I don't have any answers yet, but if I sign up to do some courses (my wife has suggested web editing as I spend half of my time on the 'bloody computer') and voluntary work, I'll gain a wide range of experience.At some point I will have to write a new C.V. Hopefully I will come up with something better than the majority of job applications I've received over the years, many of which were littered with appalling errors and bizarre comments like 'I always start the day with a loud \"Aum\"' or 'The reason I left my last job is that there was a falling out over a lady I was involved with (I am still with her).I will ensure that my hobbies and interests do not include sun baving (sic), playing on the computer, socialising, watching television or spending time with my mates. I shall also avoid cheesy photos, weird fonts, strange paper and pictures of cute fluffy kittens at the bottom of the page.If I'm lucky enough to get to the interview stage, I will remember that the employer is interviewing me and not vice versa. Over the years I've interviewed several people who behaved as if the job was already theirs and wanted to know more about the terms and conditions. I remember a young woman whose surname was Daggar (I desperately wanted to say 'Is this a Daggar I see before me?) asking how much discount she'd get on magazines, as she didn't really read books. When I explained that we didn't sell magazines she looked daggers at me (no pun intended - well, only a bit).The most gruelling experience I ever had was three years ago, when I had to interview 25 people over two days (and just to make life more complicated, I had my father's funeral the following day).One applicant told me that if she took the job she'd want to start half an hour later as the bus fares were cheaper and it wasn't worth her while travelling earlier. Another interviewee expected us to give her a pension and free parking. They didn't get the job. Neither did the Oxbridge graduate who stank of alcohol and kept using phrases like mea cupla.Fortunately there were half a dozen strong interviewees and I was able to recruit a really good team. Indeed, over the years I have been very lucky and every batch of interviews has usually yielded at least one excellent candidate. I can't think of many workplaces where you would get people with first class degrees working their arses off for £5.50 an hour.In the meantime I have just started receiving Income Support. If you're a British taxpayer I would like to thank you for your contribution and promise that the money will go to good causes. I had originally thought of contacting the Society for Distressed Gentlefolk, but it seems that I am not patrician enough to qualify for their support. I have no children at boarding school who risk suffering the ignominy of mingling with the lumpen proletariat.I promise I won't spend the money on Special Brew or squander it on scratch cards.

{"title": "The Green Light", "date": "Wednesday, July 16, 2008", "text": "I have just bought a wonderful new device called a Kitchen Composter. The idea is simple enough: instead of throwing food waste in the bin you put in in the composter, add a handful of a substance called Bokashi bran and two weeks later, the material is ready to bury in the garden or add to a compost heap. As an added bonus, a liquid is also produced which can be used to feed plants or clean drains.This isn't my kitchen but rather depressingly it's completely identical to mine, apart from the window design and lack of clutter. I must be very unoriginal. As you can see, the bin doesn't take up too much room.The Bokashi bran comes from Japan and contains a mixture of bacteria and fungi which manage to accelerate the decomposition process without producing any horrible smells. It sounds too good to be true. I shall know the truth in two weeks time, which is when the process is supposed to have finished. If it works, I'll not only have reduced the amount of waste I send to landfill sites, but also have some useful compost and plant food.Two other really useful products I've discovered recently are eco-balls - not a term of abuse, but a really effective alternative to washing powder - and an LED light bulb that only uses 1.7 watts per hour.I would like to say that I'm doing this for altruistic reasons, but the truth is that my main motive is to save money and become more self-sufficient. In an ideal world I'd live off the grid, but unfortunately that would require more money than I have to either build or convert a home to meet the necessary requirements.I would also love to think that my actions helped to contribute to reducing global warming, but I am pessimistic and believe that politicians and corporations will only address the pressing environmental issues of our time when it is too late. I agree with James Lovelock. The crisis is coming and it's naive to believe that we can still stop it. The real challenge is to manage that crisis effectively and move towards a society that is sustainable in the long term. But will that happen?Perhaps I've been reading too many John Christopher novels, but at the moment the outlook is getting increasingly grim. However, there is also a glimmer of hope in the shape of kitchen composters, hydrogen-powered cars, LED light bulbs and solar heating. New developments like these may not stop global warming, but they might make us less vulnerable to its effects."},

I'm not sure why I was so bad at games, but I suspect it was because I didn't care enough about winning. I enjoyed running and kicking a ball around in the street behind my house, but I hated organised sport. When I left school I naively assumed that I'd never have to endure the misery of a school sports day again. How wrong I was.Today I attended my son's school sports day and watched him faithfully maintain the family tradition by failing to win a single race (he scored better results than me but there were fewer fat kids to outrun in the 1970s). I wasn't bothered, but some parents were near to hysteria shouting 'Go Charlie!' 'Go Sam!' and I suspect that some of the dads would have experienced temporary impotency if their sons hadn't won a race.Today's sports day lasted for three hours! What were they thinking? I made the mistake of wearing black and after fifteen minutes of sitting in direct sunlight, I'm sure that I saw wisps of smoke start to appear. It seemed a high price to pay for the 3 minutes in which my son took part in the games.Naively, I had no idea that if I had a child it would gain me readmission into the world of playground cliques, school sports days and the all-pervading smell of stale cabbage.

{"title": "Rum, Sodomy and the Lash", "date": "Sunday, July 13, 2008", "text": "I have just finished Marcus Clarke's His Natural Life (also published as For the Term of His Natural Life) and am still reeling from the shock of reading a Victorian novel that includes homosexual rape, child suicide, cannibalism, alcoholism, atheism and adultery. Why isn't this book more widely known?Clarke's life reads like a Victorian novel. Born in London in 1846, Clarke's mother died when he was four and his childhood was marked by ill health and the erratic behaviour of his father which eventually culminated in a nervous breakdown. When Clarke reached adolescence, it was discovered that the family fortune had inexplicably disappeared and his prospects seemed grim until a relative suggested that the he should seek his fortune in Australia. Clarke arrived in Melbourne a few months after his 17th birthday. His adulthood was marked by the twin blights of a writer's life - alcoholism and penury and he died at the age of 36.His Natural Life is a great novel, but not a perfect one. It has many faults, including an excessive reliance on melodrama and that bane of classic novels, the use of highly improbable coincidences. I also felt that the last quarter of the book was quite patchy. However, none of these flaws diminish the overall experience of reading this compelling, powerful and angry novel.Set mainly in the brutal environment of a Tasmanian penal colony, Clarke's novel was originally published in serial form which perhaps explains why His Natural Life is so compulsively readable. The author is a great storyteller and this is a 'rattling good yarn', with dastardly villains, cliffhanger endings and a wonderful sense of place. But this novel's claim to greatness lies in the author's treatment of his subject matter which, in its scope and candour, bears comparison to Zola. I cannot imagine this novel being written in Victorian England, let alone published.I have tried to find a photo of the penal settlement of Port Arthur, but I don't think this picture really captures the horrors of convict life in the nineteenth century. In fact it looks very inviting. I think it's probably best to visit grim places in bad weather."},

{"title": "The Schlock of the New", "date": "Saturday, July 05, 2008", "text": "When I left bookselling I felt mild pangs of anxiety about losing touch with what was going on in the publishing world. I loved being in the privileged position of having a sneak preview of new titles before they were in the shops and also enjoyed listening to the publishers' reps bitching about certain authors.Whenever I had an appointment with a rep we'd spend at least half of the visit gossiping about the book trade. The rep would slag off the editorial department for publishing unsellable books. I'd moan about my head office for buying unsellable books. Eventually the reps would say 'Well, I suppose we'd better do some work' and we'd go through a catalogue of new titles, haggling over how many titles I should take. It was one of my favourite parts of the job.At the end of the visit I'd be handed a few proof copies. With a few notable exceptions, most of the proofs were unreadable and I used to wonder how so much dross managed to get published. I always left the proofs in the staff room for people to take home, but they'd sit there for months until the pile became structurally unsound, at which point I'd bin them.I used to send damaged copies of decent books to the local hospital, but couldn't bring myself to include many proofs. It didn't seem fair to subject someone with a serious - possibly terminal - illness to such dull writing. I wish I could give you an example of what I mean, but they were so unmemorable that I cannot recall a single title.The 3 for 2 tables weren't much better. They had a few decent novels, but most of the selection was formulaic holiday reading. I often struggled when customers asked me for personal recommendations, as I had read so few of the 3 for 2 titles. Why waste your life reading second-rate new fiction when there are so many masterpieces in the backlist?Go into any chain bookseller and you're going to see the same selection of titles. Occasionally, you might find a branch where an imaginative buyer has been able to represent some of the quirky, small press titles (Waterstone's in Brighton has a superb table of fiction in translation), but this is the exception rather than the rule.Since I left Waterstone's, my reading tastes have been dictated by a mixture of serendipitous discoveries in charity shops and secondhand booksellers, plus the recommendations of fellow bloggers. I have read books I'd never heard of and authors I never expected to like. It's been a wonderful journey of discovery.At the moment I'm reading His Natural Life by Marcus Clarke - a fantastic Victorian novel about the time when people were transported to Australia for minor misdemeanors (if only they'd bring it back - I'd be first in the queue). I'd heard of the book, but wouldn't have read it unless I'd spotted a copy in the Lewes branch of the British Heart Foundation charity shop. I've only got as far as the third chapter, but it's gripping. The blurb on the back promises: murder, mutiny, flogging, child-suicide, homosexual rape and cannibalism. What more could anyone want?However, although I could happily spend the rest of my life reading backlist titles, I don't like the idea of missing out on the next Cloud Atlas. There is nothing like reading a new novel and knowing that it will still be in print in 100 years' time."},

This may be true, but contrary to newspapers like the Daily Mail, there is no hard statistical evidence. Official figures support the view that knife crime is on the increase but the British Crime Survey - arguably a more accurate source of data - shows a drop in violent crime.A recent edition of a journal published by the Sussex Police Force includes an article about an operation that took place at a nightclub in Bognor Regis. Over 1000 people were searched as they entered the club and not a single knife was found. In fact the only illegal article discovered was a small amount of cannabis.I know that Bognor isn't the Bronx, but as anyone in Sussex will tell you, it's not the sort of place you'd want to wander around on a Friday night. Bognor's the sort of town where they sell cards that say 'Happy 30th Birthday - Granny'.

It made interesting reading and I particularly enjoyed this final question:Finally, the “if you ruled the world” question. If you could hand out to passers-by copies of one book you consider unjustly neglected, which would it be? Darkness Falls from the Air, by Nigel Balchin. Probably out of print. Haunting story of a pair of extremely sophisticated Londoners during the Blitz, and the most perfect ending of any story I’ve ever read. Suggest a campaign to bring it back into print, spearheaded by you in your blog.I can now recommend another Balchin title: The Small Back Room. I mananged to pick up this copy for 75p the other day, courtesy of Help the Aged:Ten years ago I watched the Powell and Pressburger film The Small Back Room (unaware that it started life as a novel by Nigel Balchin) and was struck by the world-weary cynicism of the main characters. It was the antithesis of the classic British war film. There were no heroes (in the Kenneth Moore sense of the word), very little action and a noticeable absence of Dunkirk Spirit. This was a film for grown-ups with real people in it.Balchin's novel is still in print, although I wonder how many shops stock it. This is a pity, as this unusual novel gives a refreshingly different perspective on Britain in World War Two - one that tallies far more with the Mass Observation accounts I mentioned in the last post.This Penguin paperback was published in 1939 - shortly before the War began. It makes quite surprising reading because it blows away the myth of Britain as a united country, ready to fight at any cost to preserve democracy. The Mass Observation movement portrays a country that is reluctant to go to war and isn't particularly bothered about what is happening in Europe as long as it doesn't affect the price of bread. Rather like today.After 1939, the MO accounts record people's frustration with British military incompetence (particularly the army), cynicism about Churchill's promises of victory and a general sense of fatigue and frustration. It is this Britain that features in Nigel Balchin's novels and they are a refreshing antidote to the (probably necessary) myths that were circulated during and after the War."},

I gritted my teeth and bought the Dave Pelzer chicken.     The obvious answer is to eat more vegetarian food which, in addition to reducing my food bill, will also lower my carbon footprint and make me less likely to develop cancer. However, even eating vegetarian isn’t quite the cheap option that it once was. Rice has more than doubled in price and the fruit and veg section is becoming more expensive by the week.     As for wine, it is no longer possible to buy anything remotely drinkable for less than £4. Every week Tesco has half price offers, but these seem to involve hiking a fairly indifferent wine up to £8 beforehand to create the impression of value. Perhaps the occasional bottle of Chablis would be better than a regular intake of something that tastes like a fermented urine sample.     To a wartime Londoner these complaints would seem ridiculous. I’ve just read a fascinating book called London Under Fire 1939-45, by Leonard Mosely (no relation to Oswald). It is a comprehensive history of the Blitz and in addition to the usual military and political overview, it includes a lot of material from the Mass Observation movement. Although I knew the basic facts about rationing, it is only when you read first hand accounts that you begin to understand what it was like to live on such meagre amounts of the basic foodstuffs.      According to Mosely’s Mass Observation accounts, most Londoners suffered from a constant, gnawing hunger. Mothers would queue for hours in an attempt to buy enough to feed their families, often with limited success. Even the boring old apple became a luxury item.     Today we are told that people ate healthily during the War, with fewer dental problems and virtually no obesity. However, the Mass Observation accounts describe a city of undernourished people who are constantly suffering from colds and flu. We have a long way to go before we reach that stage, but there is always that worrying theory that we are only four meals away from civil disorder.     These days we eat a lot of imported food. That’s because it’s usually nicer. However one of the reasons why British people didn’t starve to death during the War was because there was enough home-grown food to maintain the necessary minimum daily calorie intake. If countries are going to survive rising fuel prices and disruptions to the supply chain, then perhaps we should aim to become a little more self-sufficient once again."},
{"title": "Evoluon", "date": "Sunday, June 29, 2008", "text": "One of my first memories of television was watching the trade test transmission films on the fledgeling BBC2. This is probably because they were shown at least once a week for several years and in the pre-video era, it was unusual to see any programme more than a couple of times.My favourite film was Evoluon, made in 1968 and shown regularly until 1973. Evoluon was a flying saucer-shaped science centre, built in Eindhoven, Holland in 1966 and this short film is like a homage to the Space Age.At a time when many people are feeling fairly pessimistic about the future, there is something terribly poignant about Evoluon's optimism and blind faith in science as the guarantor of health and happiness.This was, after all, the age when we thought it was a good idea for families to live on the eighth floor of a tower block. We also looked forward to living on the moon and eating pills instead of all that miserable food business. What were we thinking?Interestingly, Evoluon's fortunes mirrored those of the Modernist movement and by the 1980s, visitor numbers had dwindled to the point where the science centre was closed. Tragically, Evoluon was re-launched ten years later as a conference centre for businesses. From the sublime to the tedious."},
{"title": "Art in a Cold Climate", "date": "Friday, June 27, 2008", "text": "In the last series of Doctor Who, there was a story about aliens pulling a London hospital off the ground and dropping it down on the moon. It seemed an utterly absurd idea until today, when I visited the De La Warr Pavillion in Bexhill.Bexhill is the sort of coastal retirement town that makes even sleepy Eastbourne look like a hedonistic, drug-fuelled, non-stop party by comparison. The most dangerous thing you'll encounter in Bexhill is a rogue electric wheelchair exceeding 5mph. If it wasn't for places like Bexhill, the Daily Express would have gone under years ago.However, right on the seafront there is a stunning Art Deco arts centre that looks as if it's been transported from a fashionable suburb of London.The De La Warr Pavillion was the first public building in the Modernist style and was commissioned in 1935 with the express purpose of providing the local people with access to art and entertainment. After an £8,000,000 refurbishment, the gallery was reopened in 2005 and it is now a hotspot on the chattering classes' map of Britain.The interior  has been  re-modelled in a  contemporary style that is sympathetic to the building's Art Deco origins  (I think I've been watching too  many editions of Property Ladder)Rock'n'Roll! It says No Photography, but I don't play by the rules (although I made sure I'd turned the flash button off first)I visited the De La Warr Pavillion earlier today, to see an exhibition called Unpopular Culture, curated by Grayson Perry. I have an affinity with Perry (cross-dressing excepted) as we both have similar backgrounds. In the photo above, he looks identical to my mum when she was younger. What was it with working class women and headscarves? Was it just to protect the perm?Unpopular Culture, according to Perry......stems from a notion that unlike today, in Britain during this period, stories about art did not feature daily in the broadsheets or contemporary artists crop up frequently in gossip columns. A time perhaps when modern art was an even more rarefied activity, practiced and appreciated by other-worldly bohemians and intellectuals. The title also refers to a feeling that many artists then made art that could be characterised as subtle, sensitive, lyrical and quiet in contrast to today when much art can seem like shouty advertisments for concepts or personalities. As a group for me these works conjure a nostalgic picture of a post-war, pre-Thatcherite Britain, more reflective, more civic and more humane.Unpopular Culture was a superb exhibition and as much as I dislike crowds, it was heartening to see that the gallery was packed. I doubt that there were many residents of Bexhill amongst the visitors, but I could be wrong.I liked the De La Warr Pavillion, but it did seem very incongruous in the hospice-like setting of Bexhill. Will it regenerate the local economy and attract arty types? I'm not convinced, but even if it just lures patrician day-trippers, the local area will benefit."},

{"title": "Work", "date": "Tuesday, June 24, 2008", "text": "Six months ago I was feeling mentally and physically exhausted by my work at Waterstone's. Every night I would lie awake in the small hours, worrying about what would happen if I lost my job. I was Mr Average, with a wife, two children and a mortgage. I was convinced that I had to keep working at any cost, otherwise everything would fall apart.Then one day everything changed.I had a rare moment of clarity and self-awareness and after asking myself what could be worse than losing my job, realised that the answer was keeping it. In a single moment, everything fell into place. I felt like Peter Finch in Network (minus the madness, I hope).That's the short version, anyway. Obviously it was a little more complicated than that, but in a nutshell I stopped working in December and officially resigned a couple of months ago. Contrary to expectations, my world hasn't fallen apart, I still have a few quid in the bank and I'm so busy that I don't know how I ever found the time to do a full-time job. At the moment I feel as if I'm on a very long holiday, albeit a rather busy one.However I'm starting to get restless. Once the novelty value of not having to go to work wears off, you are left with the question: what is my purpose? I do part-time voluntary work as magistrate and also have two young boys to keep me busy, but I feel that it is a little early in life to be semi-retired so I've started thinking about the next move.The Guardian jobs section is particularly depressing. I've been through the adverts in last week's edition of Work and found a number of recurring words:ExcellentVibrantExcitingEnthusiasticDynamicYoungExperiencedChallengingFast-pacedProactiveI used to be most of these, but not since I was under the age of ten. I had the impression that these qualities became superseded by things like empathy, wisdom, knowledge, integrity, commitment, compassion and vision, but perhaps they're not compatible with the corporate culture.What is the answer? I'm not sure, but I don't think there's any point looking in the Guardian again. I shall have to think of something else.In the meantime, here is Peter Finch in Network. 32 years on, this clip still strikes a chord:"},
{"title": "Book Heaven...and Hell", "date": "Monday, June 23, 2008", "text": "My wife likes specific answers to her questions. I prefer to be as vague as possible because as soon as I tell her what I'm doing, how long it will take and how much money I'm likely to spend, I am making a rod for my own back. In the television series The Prisoner, the Village has signs which read: Questions are a burden to others and answers a prison for oneself.I agree (although within the context of The Prisoner, it wasn't completely unreasonable to ask why one had been abducted).Today I got away with being vague, telling my wife that I was popping into town when all along I intended to jump on a train and go to Eastbourne for a return visit to Camilla's Bookshop. I almost felt like Patrick McGoohan in The Prisoner and imagined my wife in a large control room, monitoring my doomed escape attempt. However, after a 20-minute train ride I was safely in Eastbourne.At Camilla's I went straight down into the basement. I thought I was alone, but after a while I began to hear furtive snuffling noises, like a wild boar hunting for truffles. I tiptoed around each section and in a dim corner, found a man who looked as if he'd entered the shop in 1972 and had never left. He seemed unaware of my presence, so I returned to the Pelicans.The orange Penguins didn't seem as alluring this time. I found several novels by authors I'd never heard of and a cursory glance at the first page usually confirmed why they were now out of print. However there was one Spanish novel that looked quite interesting, so I started reading the first chapter.Almost immediately a middle-aged couple came down the stairs, talking to each other at a volume that suggested that they were on opposite sides of a busy road. I tried to return to my book, but they stopped right next to me and carried on talking.'Hmm, Bronte, Bronte...Shirley' the woman muttered.'Shirley you don't want to read that book!' the man joked. She roared with laughter at his abysmal pun.There is a certain type of couple where one person labours under the misapprehension that they're witty and amusing because their partner, for some unfathomable reason, actually finds their banal humour hilarious. There is a technical term for couples like this. I think it's fuckwits, but correct me if I'm wrong.I turned round to see who I was listening to and was appalled to find an overweight man who was wearing nothing but a pair of short trousers. I know the days of smelling salts and whalebone corsets are over, but it still can't be right to walk around like this. It's a bookshop, for God's sake!It's not even as if he had a good physique - this photo below is actually quite flattering  for the fat, pot-bellied, man-boobed lump of walking banality that he was. Yuk!The arrival of this appalling couple heralded the end of my visit. Luckily I'd managed to photograph several book jackets and I hope that connoisseurs like Caustic Cover Critic will enjoy seeing them:Inflation and the Compromised Church? I can't imagine that many copies were sold, but the jacket is very striking, as is this superb cover for R.D.Laing's sequel to The Divided Self:Unequal Shares is a classic Pelican cover: a simple, effective image that aptly sums-up the book.As for Aspects of the Novel, I think it's a masterpiece. I'd definitely hang it on my wall.Can you guess whether the jacket above was designed by a woman or a man? No prizes I'm afraid.With the Galbraith jacket, the visual pun manages to convey so much with such a simple image.Finally, Inside Robert Robinson - not a place that everyone would wish to visit."},

{"title": "Book Heaven", "date": "Thursday, June 19, 2008", "text": "Although it's only 13 miles away, I never go to Eastbourne.  I don't really have anything against the place, but its reputation as a rather dull geriatric coastal resort full of nursing homes and dingy guest houses isn't a great draw. Eastbourne is reputed to be a place where people go to die.However, today I woke up feeling restless and the word Eastbourne kept nagging me insistently (intimations of mortality?). I'm a great believer in following a whim so I decided to take a chance and drive there, even though I had no idea what I was was going to do once I'd arrived.I'm glad I followed my instincts because today I discovered one of the best secondhand bookshops I've ever seen:Only a few minutes' walk from Eastbourne Station, Camilla's Bookshop has three floors that are crammed from top to bottom with books. This area is just inside the main entrance:And here is a photo of a small part of the labyrinthine basement:The initial impression is one of organized chaos, but the sections are far more ordered than they look and this section of Penguin paperbacks is in strict alphabetical order:Although these Pelican titles seem to be in a slightly more random arrangement:The Pelican jackets are masterpieces of design and when I get the chance, I shall return and take some more pictures.Sadly, like many local councils, Eastbourne's seems to be on a mission to deter people from visiting the town and I only had enough change to pay for an hour's parking. I resented having to cut my visit short, but perhaps it was a good thing as I could have spent a fortune. In the end, I spent a fairly modest £9.50 on eight paperbacks, including Ballard's Drowned World, Muriel Spark's Robinson and a title I'd never heard of, One by David Karp.Camilla's Bookshop is a paradise for anyone who loves browsing and it's the antithesis of today's bestseller-driven chain stores. I can't wait to go back.Walking back to my car, I was pleased to see this bookshop:Two years ago, Jeff Doak ran one of the most profitable branches of Ottakar's, but when HMV Media bought the company they decided to convert Jeff's shop into a branch of HMV, as there was already a branch of Waterstone's in town. The staff were only given  few weeks' notice and were expected to work up until the last minute, boxing up their stock to return to the publishers and other stores. To add insult to injury, they were asked to relinquish their Waterstone's staff discount cards.After a period of uncertainty, Jeff Doak decided to open a bookshop of his own, using his house as security against a bank loan. At the time the general consensus was that he was taking a huge risk that could easily end in tears, so it was heartening to see that his shop was full of customers.It's only a tiny shop, but somehow Jeff has managed to squeeze in a really good range of children's books and a coffee shop! The shop is bright, colourful and welcoming and if lived in Eastbourne, I'd be a regular customer.I didn't see a lot of Eastbourne, but Camilla's Bookshop alone is enough to tempt me back. There are worse places to die in.On the way back, I stopped at Beachy Head - the suicide hotspot of Southern England. The wind was so strong that I almost got blown off the cliff edge. I expect that some people would have assumed that I'd taken my own life. However, I hope that my bright pink Camilla's Bookshop carrier bag, bulging with eight novels, would provide evidence to the contrary."},
{"title": "Whatever happened to Timothy Mo?", "date": "Wednesday, June 18, 2008", "text": "Earlier this morning I was reading DJ Taylor's book A Vain Conceit, his 1989 survey of contemporary British fiction. It's a wonderfully opinionated polemic which still hits a nerve 19 years on and mentions a number of writers who have faded into obscurity. Do the names Mervyn Jones, Helen Muir or Jeremy Brooks mean anything to you?One name that I did recognise was Timothy Mo. He used to be mentioned in the same breath as McEwan, Ishiguro and Byatt and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize three times with Sour Sweet, An Insular Possession and The Redundancy of Courage. Then he made what was, perhaps, the greatest mistake of his career.Allegedly fed-up with the practices of British publishers, he decided to cut out the middle man and self-publish his next novel, Brownout on Breadfruit Boulevard. It was viewed by some as a brave decision, but others felt that with Mo's track record, it could be a very lucrative one.Sadly for Mo, self-publishing turned out to be a disastrous move. Perhaps the novel wouldn't have sold anyway - the title was pretty awful. However although the reviews weren't as enthusiastic as they had been for his last three books, they were still pretty decent and the book should have sold purely on the strength of Mo's reputation.What went wrong?First, there was the jacket design. It was bloody awful and looked really amateurish. Second,  however well-establish an author is,  they don't have a marketing department that will ensure that the front cover of the new novel is plastered across dozens of tube stations. Third, Brownout on Breadfruit Boulevard was published just after the Net Book Agreement collapsed, making the book trade a tougher place for full-priced hardback fiction.Mo self-published another novel in 2000, but since then he has remained silent. There is an author website, but it is a masterpiece of brevity and gives no clues about any forthcoming works to be published by the appropriately-named Paddleless Press.Self-publishing has its success stories, but they are the exception rather than the rule. The demise of an author of Mo's stature is a sobering example of what can happen if you try to go it alone."},

In an earlier post I referred to my particular bugbears, which include robust, core values and high end. However, I wasn't able to mention the ones that were used at Waterstone's, so here's a list of some of the nonsense I had to put up with when I worked for them:UpskillEasy winsBig piece of workBrand wheelManaging expectationsSpace planningResource Heads upProductFour quadrantsOne of the reasons I went into bookselling was to get away from the world of ball park figures, team building and rebranding. When I left university I briefly worked for a market research company and used to spend my lunch hours in the local pub, listening to businessmen talking in their nasal 'Estuary' accents. I couldn't believe that these smartly dressed, well-paid people could get away with talking so much crap and resolved that I would never work anywhere where business speak was used.I succeeded for many years and although the price was a relatively low salary, it was one worth paying. Then Waterstone's took over Ottakar's and I suddenly found myself in a world of brand wheels (think of the Buddhist Wheel of Life, but one designed by an idiot), managing expectations (saying no, in other words) and big pieces of work (i.e. overwork). Also, the managing director's weekly message always ended with the phrase 'Good trading.' Yuk. This was a retail culture rather than a bookselling one, as demonstrated by a rumoured memo that said 'When are Ottakar's managers going to realise that they are retailers, not booksellers.'I am not against new phrases if they serve a purpose. The verb parenting might be annoying, but it was invented because there was no single word for the act of being a parent (as far as I know). However in the business world, too many people abuse the English language in order to obfuscate the truth and lend an air of importance to mundane, everyday actions.How can we fight business speak? I have always found ridicule to be a useful weapon, but as this isn't always practical in the workplace the best alternative is to always employ plain English. This isn't always as easy as it sounds, because so many buzzwords have been invented to conceal an unpalatable truth.Going forward, I think we should fast track a more robust agenda which tackles these issues head on because at the end of the day, it's not rocket science. Know what I mean?STOP PRESS! The BBC website has now published a Top50 of Business Speak, submitted by their readers. It's well worth a look. It included two that I'd forgotten to mention: cascade and end of play."},
{"title": "Warwick Deeping", "date": "Sunday, June 15, 2008", "text": "In his wonderful essay Bookshop Memories, Orwell lamented that the authors who were most popular with his customers were Ethel M Dell and Warwick Deeping. I didn't recognise the first name, but the second was familiar from my early days in bookselling when a few of Deeping's fans were still alive, albeit barely.I remember the look of incredulity when I explained that Deeping's novels were all out of print. He was, after all, one of the bestselling novelists of the 20s and 30s and had published over 70 books by the time he died in 1950. To go from being so successful to a name that was unknown to anyone born after 1930 seemed a particularly harsh fate. Was he really that bad?It was obvious that Deeping's novels weren't forgotten classics but perhaps, like Hugh Walpole and Delderfield, they were perfectly fine middle-brow novels that deserved a new generation of readers. I would have to try and get hold of one.At first I didn't have any luck, but one day my wife found a Deeping novel called Laughing House in a local charity shop. The jacket is quite nice:But even better is this beautiful book plate, which someone has pasted inside the front cover. Are those bombed-out buildings in the background? Given the novel's publication date of 1946, they could be:On the back of the dust jacket, there is a comprehensive list of Mr Deeping's novels to date. He certainly was prolific, but was it a case of never mind the quality, feel the width?I opened the book and started reading:This is the story of a House, a house which was born in more spacious days, and sat placidly for many year like a white bird in a green nest, a house that suffered one war and grievous sorrow, and survived to suffer in yet another war. Its history is human history, as a house's history should be, if it has strength and breadth, beauty and dignity. Many such houses are doomed to die. Some will survive to live strange, new lives, for the new rhythm - like jazz music - is not of the age that created them.A few sentences later, Deeping adds:My prejudices...are those of an old man, and to the young the old can be boring. I understand that to some of the young we are known as \"Bumbles.\" Well, this is the book of a Bumble.At this point I felt that I had read enough. I flicked through the rest of Laughing House and saw page after page of Pooterish prose and jolly 'By jove!' dialogue. I decided that Warwick Deeping wasn't for me.Deeping's best-known novel is Sorrell and Son, which was dramatised by the BBC in1987. I assume that the novel was reissued then, but can't find any record of it. There is a glowing review for the novel on Amazon, which reads as follows:This is a deeply moving and uplifting story of a father's devotion to his son's future set after World War 1. Written at a time when such simple values as courtesy, consideration, hard work and simple rewards were accepted as normal. I have read the book many times and been moved to tears by developments in the closing pages.So perhaps I shouldn't judge Warwick Deeping on the strength of Laughing House. Maybe he was having an off day when he wrote it.I have found this splendid photo of Warwick Deeping. As you can see, he was no looker..."},

I remember a time when he was mentioned in the same breath as Roth, Bellow and Updike, but today most of his novels are out of print.In today's Guardian, Jonathan Raban recommends Malamud's third novel, A New Life, which is a semi-autobiographical story about New York high school teacher Sy Levin's doomed quest for redemption, exchanging his alcohol-fuelled, problem-ridden life in New York for the promise of a fresh start at a university in Oregon. It's a familiar theme, but Malamud's account is as heartbreakingly perceptive as Richard Yates at his best and it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call the book a masterpiece.However, as Raban points out, A New Life is out of print, which is scandalous. I believe that Random House currently have the rights to this novel, so let's hope that they remedy this state of affairs. In the meantime, secondhand copies are available from the usual places."},

My sons will say what a brilliant example I was and fondly recall anecdotes from their idyllic childhood. It will be Enid Blyton meets Peter and Jane.The reality is sadly quite different. Most of the time, we go to Tescos, watch television, get fed-up with each other and spend too much time on the internet. Rainy days are the worst. My older son hates playing with toys or board games, so he moans incessantly until we allow him to play PS2. The youngest son's attention span is limited to five minutes, which makes him hard to entertain. I often end the day feeling a dismal failure as an example of fatherhood.However, there are occasions where our lives briefly collide with the ideal. The weather is good, the children are happy and it almost feels as if this is the beginning of better times. I experienced this briefly last Sunday when I took my sons pond dipping in the local nature reserve.We arrived early in the morning armed with fishing nets and jam jars and began searching for frogs, sticklebacks and tadpoles. Unlike some childhood activities, I still find playing in rivers and ponds as engrossing as I did when I was a boy. Peering into the murky depths of the water, all sense of time is lost and you become attuned to every little noise and movement in the water. This must be the attraction of fishing.After a while, we were joined by a man and his three-year-old son. The boy looked perfectly normal, but the father was short, with black hair cut into a pudding basin shape and a beaky nose - he could have been a stunt double for Roman Polanski.'WELL THEO, LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND TODAY!' he bawled in a high-pitched, middle-class, sing-song voice, with the exaggerated enthusiasm of a children's television presenter. This is one of my wife's bugbears - fathers who talk to their children in a loud voice so that we can all hear what a great dad they are.'LOOK! LOOK! A FROG THEO! DID YOU SEE THE FROG THEO?' he exclaimed, almost jumping with excitement. My older son and I exchanged a glance.'OH DEAR! HE GOT AWAY!' Suddenly, he marched over in our direction and thrust his finger at our jam jar. 'LOOK THEO, THEY'VE GOT SOME FROGS!'I quietly fumed and ignored the man, but then I started to feel guilty. Why was I so bloody anti-social? If I go anywhere I always pick the seat or table furthest from anyone else. Why couldn't I just smile and show the frogs to the father and his son?My wife arrived and I wondered what she would make of Captain Beaky. I was expecting a lecture on accepting that other people were equally entitled to come here, but after a couple of minutes of listening to him exclaiming and bounding around, she whispered 'Yes, he's fucking annoying.'Eventually my oldest son saved the day by suddenly saying 'Excuse me, could you leave us alone please?'. He said it with a polite, innocent, formality that made him sound like a child from a Victorian novel, but the message couldn't have been plainer."},

Even though I am not Dutch and have never sung professionally, it seemed a perfectly reasonable request. I wasn't so happy about the fact that I had less than 24 hours to rehearse, but was assured that I would only have to read an autocue and mime to a backing track. I said yes.'Oh, there is just one other thing we want you to do' they said.'What's that?' I asked.'We want you to blacken-up.'For the first few minutes after waking up, I was puzzling about the juxtaposition of Eurovision and dressing like a Black and White Minstrel, then I remembered reading a story on BBC News the day before in which Terry Wogan suggested that one of the reasons why Britain came last was because we were represented by black singer Andy Abraham, a finalist from the X Factor.Were Europeans really that racist, or was the song to blame? I watched Andy Abraham's performance on YouTube, followed by the winning Russian entry. The British song wasn't a clear winner by any means, but neither was it the worst song and it should have reached the final half dozen. The winning Russian song was so bland that I'd forgotten it before it had finished. So what happened on the night?I suspect that the poor result for Andy Abraham was partly due to racism, but also perhaps a reflection of Britain's unpopularity, particularly in eastern Europe. As for Russia's victory, I wouldn't put it past them to have employed some sort of speed-dial technology to bump-up the phone votes. Either that, or people just love Russia.How depressing that in 2007, the Eurovision Song Contest is more nationalistic than ever. As a boy I remember being allowed to stay up to watch it and whilst we wanted Britain to win, if we thought another country had a better song we rooted for them. It was the song that mattered.Today we know that Cyprus always gives Greece 12 points, Germany will only get a token 2 from Israel, all the Scandinavian countries will vote for each other and that the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina will give Serbia full marks. It's a farce.Eurovision used to be one of the television highlights of my year. I'd watch it with friends and we'd laugh at the camp singers and their absurd songs, take bets on the winner and spend the next few weeks singing the Turkish entry. It's sad that this fun, festival of naff songs has turned into a grim, chauvinistic struggle. It's also ironic that as the contest has become more nationalistic, the songs have become blander and more international in flavour.The joke isn't funny any more.In the meantime, here is the superb 1980 entry from Belgium by a band called Telex. Their song is an amiable piss-take of the Song for Europe and they paid the price by coming last. Perhaps their electro-pop, postmodern tribute to Eurovion was a little too ahead of its time..."},

{"title": "Dungeness", "date": "Wednesday, June 04, 2008", "text": "Dungeness is a strange place. Over thousands of years nature has reclaimed land from the sea, creating a vast, flat, desolate landscape of shingle ridges. There is no soil, but somehow plants manage to thrive and in spring the beach is covered in sea kale and wild flowers. To add to the strangeness of Dungeness, there are two nuclear reactors and the very late Derek Jarman's house:Last week we took a friend to Dungeness. I was uncertain how it would go down with my two sons: they are both blissfully ignorant of the films of Mr Jarman and the oldest one has a phobia of radiation, which only emerged when he was due to have an x-ray in Brighton Hospital. I needn't have worried. Both boys loved the beach, with its abandoned boats, driftwood and flotsam.There is something post-apocalyptic about this landscape and the abundance of weird plants  recalls the genetic mutations of the Badlands in John Wyndham's Chrysalids. I climbed into one of the boats and although it wasn't seaworthy, it was in reasonably good condition. Why had it been abandoned?As for the beach, where was everyone on this bank holiday weekend? We had the whole place to ourselves and it wasn't hard to let the imagination wander and believe that we were the last people left.I had been here before, when I was four. My parents booked a week in a nearby holiday camp, but could only afford off-season. We spent a miserable time which was mainly spent cowering in bus shelters from the wind and rain, sitting in dining halls listening to several hundred of our fellow guests slurping thin, watery soup and, worst of all, the cabaret performances of artistes who hadn't made it to Butlins. I reflected on how things had changed but on the way back we passed a Pontins, so some poor buggers are still enjoying overcooked food and toupe-wearing singers.Dungeness is a fascinating place in its own right, but the interest is compounded by the presence of two buildings that contain lethal radiocative material. I would love to visit the reactor complex. A few years ago there was a visitor centre, opened in an attempt to change the public's attitude to nuclear power. Since '9/11', security has been stepped up and guests are no longer welcome. I've tried contacting Dungeness power station through the internet, but it is very difficult to find any point of contact.Of course, Dungeness is small fry. Serious nuclear tourists go to Chernobyl, which now has guided tours of the evacuation zone. From the comfort of a luxury, air-conditioned coach, you can see how nature has recovered from the disaster and even visit the fairground in Pripyat. However, although many claim that the area is now safe, there are still hotspots.Click on the radiation symbol for this scary video:"},
{"title": "The next big thing", "date": "Sunday, June 01, 2008", "text": "Apparently sales of misery memoirs have recently take a nosedive, which is something of a relief. I'm a big fan of misery, but I prefer it to be recounted with an understated, Jack Hawkins-like stoicism ('Bit of a bad show, really') and a dash of black humour, rather than the cloying, sentimental Poor Me school of writing. Self-pity is never an attractive quality, even if it is justified.But I digress...Reading about the demise of misery memoirs prompted me to recall some of the other publishing bandwagons I've witnessed over the last couple of decades. Here is my top ten:Environmental books. Do you remember the Green Party coming third in the UK European elections in 1988? Do you remember all of those t-shirts with 'ethnic' drawings of dolphins and rainforests, and the rather banal statement 'SAVE THE PLANET' underneath? It looked like the beginning of a quiet revolution and most branches of Waterstone's had a separate environmental section in the late 80s. Heathcote Williams' Whale Nation was a bestseller. Then suddenly, without any warning, the genre died and wasn't to be seen again until a few years ago.Aspirational travel writing. In the early 90s Peter Mayle - author of the Wicked Willy books - hit the big time with A Year in Provence. The book was so successful that Mayle's quiet little village quickly became a Mecca for middle-class, middle-aged Britons and he was forced to move. This book spawned a spate of imitations, in which middle-class, middle-aged British people wrote accounts of their quest for la bon vie, writing patronising charicatures of the locals. Some publishers were astute enough to resurrect out of print titles, notably those by Lady Fortescue.Aga Sagas. They bought The L-Shaped Room in the 60s, The Women's Room in the 70s, Virago in the 80s, but now many women of the baby-boomer generation wanted something that reflected the social mores of Middle England. Joanna Trollope seemed to appear out of nowhere and soon her entire backlist was in the Top 20. Her paperback jacket style, with  muted watercolour images, became de rigeur for any tale of menopausal, market town angst and many similar authors (Kathleen Rowntree, Marika Cobbold, Angela Huth, Madeleine Wickham etc) were relaunched with sub-Trollope jackets. As a bookseller I remember creating a display bin with Joanna Trollope at the top and the others further down. I had to restock it every other day.SAS memoirs. First there was Bravo Two Zero, then The One That Got Away. After that, it seemed as if anyone who had spent more than five minutes in the Gulf War had an exciting tale of derring-do to recount. These books are popular with men who still live with their mothers.True Crime. This genre ticked along quietly until Sun columnist-turned-publisher, John Blake, released The Guv'nor. This memoir of a 'hard bastard' was a publishing phenomenon and launched a whole new sub-genre of criminal memoirs. The jacket design usually consisted of a grainy, close-up mugshot of a criminal with a tagline something along the lines of  I'm completely mental and violent. If you don't like me, I'll pull your ears off, slowly. These memoirs were lucrative for publishers, but less so for booksellers as the titles were usually stolen by aspiring hard bastards.  These memoirs were also inexplicably popular with women. (I remember seeing a young women with a black eye, sitting on a bus with her five-year-old daughter. In her lap she had a copy of The Guv'nor, which was open at the photo section. She pointed to various figures, saying to her daughter 'That's yer Uncle Kenny, that's Uncle Ron, that's Uncle Mick...)Diana books. Although there were a few Diana books in circulation before her death - most notably Andrew Morton's Diana and Anna Pasternak's lamentable Princess in Love - the posthumous mass hysteria amongst the normally cynical British public prompted a similar over-reaction in the book trade. For months, the Diana table was an obligatory fixture in many bookshops. Even after the Diana phenomenon waned, publishers continued to print memoirs and conspiracy theory titles, claiming that although they were aware that the craze was over, this book was different.Chic Lit. Blame Helen Fielding for the plethora of Bridget Jones imitations. Once this genre would have been called Romance, but that's too old-fashioned for today's feisty, independent, girl-about-town, so instead we have Chick Lit. Interestingly, unlike Joanna Trollope there has been no attempt to imitate the Picador Bridget Jones jackets. Authors in this category include Sophie Kinsella (aka Madeleine Wickham), Jane Green, Marian Keyes, Adele Parks and Katie Fforde. Chick Lit heroines are modern career women who still yearn for Mr D'arcy.Lad Lit. No prizes for guessing who the guilty party is in this case. Like Helen Fielding, Nick Hornby's writing is both modern and curiously old-fashioned. On the one hand we have a new man who isn't afraid to talk about his emotions. On the other, we have a writer who celebrates blokeishness and can be seen as part of the 90s backlash to the puritanical values of the 80s, when enjoying a Carry-On film was tantamount to admitting that you were a misogynistic fascist. Lad Lit can be a lucrative genre, but there is a price to be paid: Tony Parsons lost his credibility almost overnight with the publication of Man and Boy.Possessive book titles. Once there was just Flaubert's Parrot. I'm not sure what came next - either Michael Palin's Hemingway's Chair or Captain Corelli's Mandolin, but suddenly every other book seemed to have a possessive title: Nathaniel's Nutmeg, Fermat's Last Theorem, Galileo's Daughter, Churchill's Cigar etc. What is behind this trend? Is the possessive title a signifier of the sort of personal narrative that would have been frowned on once? I don't know, but it's rather annoying.Mind, Body and Spirit. 'Never give a sucker an even break', to quote WC Fields. This was a huge growth area in the book trade before and after the year 2000, but during the last few years sales have really dropped off. I wouldn't want to dismiss the genre entirely. Books like Joseph Hartmann's The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight is a laudable attempt to find spiritual meaning in a secular society, but sadly the genre is dominated by charlatans and mediocre intellects. Too many of the books place their emphasis on the you, instead of encouraging people to find a meaning through the traditional avenues - contemplation and good works.So what's next? Recently there have been plenty of Eats, Shoots and Leaves spin-offs, Schott's Miscellany imitations and lots of nostalgia titles. The Dangerous Book for Boys is a nostalgic view of masculinity in an age of stabbings and gang culture. With the forthcoming economic downturn, we should expect more nostalgia and escapism rather than gritty memoirs. But alongside a yearning for the past, readers will also be looking to the future and the next few years should see a growing market for books about ethical living and green politics. Conversely, there will also be growth in demand for books that debunk the likelihood of global warming.But I may be completely wrong. It's amazing how out of touch you can get in such a short space of time."},
{"title": "The future isn't Orange", "date": "Friday, May 30, 2008", "text": "There can't be many jobs that are more depressing than working in a call centre. Huddled together like battery hens in an artificially lit room, your job consists of receiving abuse from angry customers, explaining complicated procedures to stupid people and trying to make yourself understood to foreigners. I did something similar once for a market research company and it was hell.To me, the call centre is the 21st century equivalent of the cotton mill. You may not lose an arm or work to the point of physical exhaustion - we don't allow that any more in our advanced, caring society. Instead, the toll on your health is psychological. You are just a cog in a wheel. Your individuality is irrelevant; you are merely required to be the mouthpiece for an organisation. If you start to joke around with your colleagues, there is always a supervisor on hand to reprimand you.This is why I found the following anecdote heartening:A friend of mine received a call from Orange asking her if she was interested in upgrading her mobile phone. The caller dutifully read the script telling her all of the wonderful ways in which Orange could enhance her life and she made a flippant remark about his apparent enthusiasm.His reply went something like this:Oh yes madam, I live and breathe Orange, day and night madam. Even my fucking blood runs orange, madam. My car's orange, my bedroom's orange and I'm even wearing orange underpants, madam.And now I can see my supervisor looking at me madam, but I don't give a fuck because this is my last day, madam.A moment of triumph for the human spirit. My friend particularly enjoyed the use of the word madam."},

I was becoming mentally and physically exhausted, but felt that I had to keep going. Then one day everything changed and I suddenly realised that I didn't have to tolerate any more crap. We always have a choice, although it may not always feel that way.Money is in short supply and I know that at some point in the near future we will drain our bank account dry, but I'm amazed that we've lasted this long. I didn't realise how much money I'd save by not working. Not only have I saved a fortune in fuel and lunch costs, but I've also had the time to do jobs that I would have had to pay other people for (my garden has been completely landscaped for under £500, which is considerably lower than the £3000 I was quoted). It's been a revelation.I have also learned the art of shopping around - something I never had time for when I was working 40 or more hours a week. I know that a box of tissues will cost 35p in Asda, as opposed to over £1 anywhere else. I have also discovered that my children are much happier playing with driftwood on a beach than going to a theme park. Holidays abroad are out, but thanks to global warming England is becoming positively Mediterranean. Food is becoming a problem - prices have suddenly shot up during the last couple of months, but there are always cheap options.I don't intend to live like this on a permanent basis. I want to work and would find it very frustrating if I didn't have my duties as a Justice of the Peace to keep me busy. But even if I do earn a decent salary, I will never forget the lessons I have learned during the last few months. Time is more important than money.If you're stuck in a rut, I'd strongly recommend Tom Hodgkinson's book How to be Free. You'll probably find it in the humour section of a bookshop, but although Hodgkinson is a very amusing writer the core of the book is an extremely well-argued polemic against our post-industrial consumer society. Hodgkinson has no problem with work; it's jobs that he has reservations about and the degree to which they dominate our lives.A few years ago I read a shocking statistic that said if Americans wanted to maintain the standard of living they had in 1949 (and it was pretty good then), they'd only have to work two days a week. Instead they're working their arses off to buy a lot of things they don't really need and only enjoy two weeks' holiday a year. Madness!I shall be following Tom Hodgkinson's manifesto, with the possible exception of playing the ukulele. As he wisely says: Life is absurd. We are free. Be merry."},
{"title": "The Age of Certainty", "date": "Tuesday, May 20, 2008", "text": "I have resigned from my job as a Waterstone's manager. I have no idea what I'm going to do next, but in spite of this I know that I've made the right decision. I'll miss my friends and I will also miss working with books, but I felt that I had no choice but to leave.I used to be a manager for Ottakar's Bookstores and loved my job. Under the charismatic leadership of James Heneage, Ottakar's was a wonderful company to work for that valued individuality and creativity over compliance and procedure. As a manager I felt that my remit was to ensure that staff morale was one of the top priorities and I found it really rewarding to see booksellers develop and become managers themselves.Sadly, in 2006 HMV Media bought Ottakar's and incorporated it into its Waterstone's chain. Within a matter of months every branch of Ottakar's was rebranded and new systems were introduced. I tried to be open-minded about my new employer, but like many of my colleagues, I felt increasingly disillusioned by certain aspects of the business.It is tempting to write a long, damning diatribe against Waterstone's, but although it might be cathartic to vent my spleen, I would be doing a disservice to the many people who work there who are passionate about books and often do an excellent job against the odds. There are many good things about Waterstone's, but the sum isn't equal to its parts. My own impression is that the company is over-regulated and that there are too many people in middle-management who don't understand the book trade and treat it like any other area of retail, referring to books as product. Bookselling is different.Perhaps the most succinct and articulate summary of the differences between Ottakar's and Waterstone's was made recently by a former colleague, who wrote:There seems to be a different definition of what makes a good manager in W - a  competent administrator who can follow and implement instructions.  O managers  were encouraged to focus on running and developing a business. Two different  aspects of the same role, but I think many of those who, like you, excel at the  latter find nothing satisfying about spending eight hours a day doing the former.Apparently there is a sea change at Waterstone's. A staff opinion survey revealed that morale was even lower than the senior management feared and this year there will supposedly be a concerted effort to bring back the passion and individuality that made Waterstone's so special in the distant past. The managers I've spoken to certainly seem more optimistic than they have been for a long time. I hope that the senior management have the vision to make real changes rather than cosmetic ones.If I ran Waterstone's I would scrap at least half of the checklists and reports that are released every week, ensure that a manager's accountability was proportionate to the control they had over their shop and finally, I would make it a sackable offence for anyone to use the acronym JFDI (Just Fucking Do It)!Between a third and half of Ottakar's managers have left Waterstone's in the last couple of years. Some left straight away, but many decided to see what life was like under Waterstone's before deciding it wasn't for them. Interestingly, in some areas of the country the number of resignations has been lower than a quarter whilst in others it has been well over 50%, which would suggest that the local regional manager has exercised some influence in people's decisions. I have heard some very disturbing allegations, which I won't repeat here.Financially, Waterstone's is in a stronger position than it has been for years. The latest managing director has introduced many important commercial improvements, including a transactional website and a loyalty card, but it is relatively easy to improve a company that has been poorly managed in the past. The real challenge is to restore that indefinable but vital element that made Ottakar's such a wonderful company to work for: the magic.I am now unemployed and should be feeling despondent, but in fact I'm happier than I have been for years. I no longer have to lie awake at night worrying about deadlines and targets. I don't have much money but I am free and that feels great. I have also discovered that it's possible to live on very little if you really put your mind to it.Strangely enough, although I am not working I'm actually busier than ever. In addition to working as a part-time magistrate I have two children to look after, a home to decorate and lots of forms to fill in to prove that I'm not trying to defraud the state. It's a full life.At some point in the near future I will work again. It may be in the book trade, but I'm also tempted to try something completely different - possibly in the environmental or charity sector. Whatever I end up doing, it will have to be something I feel committed to. Life is too short to spend 40 hours a week doing something you don't enjoy.In the meantime I have lots of books to read, starting with Tom Hodgkinson's How to be Idle."},

I have forgotten many names, but a few stick out. For example, I remember selling lots of Fay Weldon novels and having to restock the entire backlist every few weeks. Today you'd be hard pressed to find a single title in the average Waterstone's. And whatever happened to the once-popular Tama Janowitz? Here is my list of yesterday's heroes:Poppy Z BriteHelen ZahaviNigel WattsStepehn AmidonPeter BensonPaul WatkinsTerry McMillanJeremy ReedBrian MooreCampbell ArmstrongAngela HuthCaryl PhillipsMario Vargas LlosaScott TurowChristopher HopeE L DoctorowAnita MasonAlison LurieMarguerite Yourcenar  Amos OzLesley Grant-AdamsonKeith WaterhouseJosephine HartKathleen RowntreeLisa St Aubin de Teran...The list could go on if I had a better memory. You may disagree with some of the names chosen and it's possible that moving from London to provincial bookselling in the mid-90s has disorted my view of things. But the fact remains that many of these authors (most of whom are still alive) have dropped of the radar, replaced by new names. Why?The glib answer is that fashions change, but there are many other factors at work. I can think of at least one writer who annoyed their publisher so much that their backlist quietly went out of print. Others were eclipsed by authors writing in a similar genre (Scott Turow's demise can be directly traced to the ascent of John Grisham).From my perspective, there isn't one writer on the list that really excites me, with the possible exception of Peter Benson and there are enough newer writers around who are much better. You may feel differently.To return to Fay Weldon, she once came to a shop I worked in for a signing and was charm itself. All of the customers were delighted, with the exception of one man who looked confused and disappointed. Later I discovered that he was a metalwork enthusiast who had misheard someone talking about the signing and thought that we were having a welding evening."},
{"title": "Hair", "date": "Monday, May 05, 2008", "text": "I hate having my hair cut. It's not the cut itself that bothers me, but the prospect of having either an agonizingly stilted conversation with somebody or a long, awkward silence.I tried going to a few barbers, but after some haircuts that left me looking like a Serbian war criminal, I decided to patronise Toni and Guy. Their haircuts are very good, but in order to justify their exhorbitant prices they extend the process from a barber's ten minutes to a half hour ordeal of hair washing, head massages, coffee and small talk.The staff at Toni and Guy all seem young and beautiful and when I walk through the door, I always feel as if they're thinking 'What are you doing here?'.To compound the sense of alienation, they play music at a volume that rearranges your internal organs and makes you feel old and boring. To call it background music would be a mistake. It's foreground music and says that Toni and Guy is part of a wider culture of hedonistic, sexy young people who spend a large part of their disposable income on looking good. What am I doing here?With Ibiza Club Anthems at full throttle, I try to guess what would be an acceptable volume for speaking without seeming as if I'm some shouting loon. I always get it wrong and the conversation usually goes like this:'Hi (not hello, that's too stuffy for a 'happening' place like this). I'd like a cut and blow dry please.'BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM'SORRY?'(Oh God, did I say cut and blow job by mistake?) 'I'D LIKE A CUT AND BLOW DRY''OKAY. WHO D'YOU NORMALLY SEE?' I'll mumble something about seeing different people each time, as I can never remember who cut my hair when I last had it cut, four months earlier. Then I'll sit down and wait for what seems like a geological era until someone appears with a black shroud that looks like something out of The Seventh Seal.We begin with the ritual of annointment. They always wash my hair three times, as if I'm some filthy old tramp that needs to be decontaminated and I try to see if the person next to me is also receiving the same treatment. Then comes the head massage. I know some men would pay good money to have a teenage girl's breasts rubbing against them as she caresses their head, butI find this level of intimacy with a stranger rather uncomfortable.By the time I'm at the stage where I have the consultation with my stylist, I'm a broken man. I want to say 'Do what you like, just make it quick.' However, I feel obliged to take my hair as seriously as they seem to.  Then the cut begins and with it, the dreaded small talk.Sometimes, when I say I work in a bookshop that's enough to kill the conversation dead, but more often than not I will be asked what I think of the latest development in Eastenders, where I'm going on holiday and whether I will be going clubbing that evening. Clubbing? I want to say 'Do I look like the sort of person that will be going clubbing?'One day, I discovered an Arab barber. He spoke virtually no English and the only thing he said was 'Wha'numma'youwan?' I had no idea what he was talking about, but picked three as it was my lucky number and ten minutes later I left with a reasonably good haircut.Sadly I left the town of my Arabian barber and have spent the last six months growing my hair to the point where I have become feral. I quite liked it, but my wife said that people would think I was letting myself go, so last Friday I trawled the streets of Lewes in search of a cheap, decent haircut.Success! I not only got a decent haircut for £10, but also found a barber with a sense of humour and we spent 20 minutes having a laugh about celebrities. I told him about my encounters with Jordan and Petre Andre and also why very few people in the book trade have any time for Jeffery Archer. Then he told me about Ronnie Corbett.I've always liked Ronnie Corbett and was dismayed to hear that my barber's mate, who works at Gatwick Airport, rates little Ronnie as one of the most difficult people he's ever had to deal with. When the Corbster flies in, the staff apparently draw lots to decide who will serve him. I wished I hadn't been told this. I liked Ronnie Corbett, the armchair raconteur and tireless fundraiser for charity.But back to the subject of hair, you really can't beat a good barber. They are the taxi drivers of the scalp. After ten minutes or so of putting the world to rights I feel at one with my fellow man and far more relaxed than I ever had after an Indian head masage."},

Only this month it has produced this image of galaxies colliding:In five years' time a new space telescope will be launched, promising images of a far greater resolution. In the meantime, the Hubble continues to surprise us and it is scandalous that NASA contemplated cancelling any further maintenance missions.

Food prices are rising at an alarming rate (even boring old rice has gone up 63% since last year) and with the price of oil well past $100 per barrel, it's likely that things will only get worse.There's a long waiting list for most of the allotments in Lewes, although as most of them are occupied by elderly men the turnover must be quite high. All I need is a very cold winter. Also, I would imagine that if the supposedly forthcoming economic recession really takes off, councils will be under more pressure to provide plots of land.I once ran an allotment with three men I used to meet in my local pub in Twickenham. It was a disaster. One of the men was a very left-wing politics lecturer and wanted to instigate five-year plans and quotas. The second man was from a moneyed background and his only experience of gardening was watching labourers toiling away on his parents' land. The third man was obsessed with potatoes.If we'd spent more time digging and less time planning and arguing, our allotment might have been a success. Sadly, in the case of allotments, democracy doesn't always work. I shan't make the same mistake again."},
{"title": "Magical Mystery Tour", "date": "Tuesday, April 22, 2008", "text": "During the last couple of years my oldest son has become increasingly resistant to new experiences. The four-year-old boy who loved tasting the local food in Andalucia has turned into an eight-year-old who doesn't want to go abroad, thinks London's too busy and would rather visit the same place every week, as long as it doesn't involve spending more than 20 minutes in the car. His ideal day would probably involve crisps, Play Station, chocolate and a trip to a leisure centre.On the plus side our carbon footprint is much smaller. However, I don't want my son's world shrinking to within a 10-mile radius of Lewes, so last Saturday I decided to take him and his brother on a mystery tour. I figured that if they didn't know where they were going or how far it was, then they'd have nothing to object to.When we arrived, after over an hour in the car, I was prepared for the worst. It was raining and I expected my son to complain that we'd driven all this way just to visit a boring old castle, but the first words he uttered were wow and amazing!I agreed. It was impressive:Built in 1365, Bodiam Castle is tucked in a remote corner of the Sussex/Kent border and on a cold, drizzly Saturday morning, it was fortunately free of coachloads of visitors. Nothing kills the atmosphere of a historical site more than hordes of camera-wielding tourists, which is why I like visiting places out of season.We climbed winding stone steps up to the top of the castle and pretended to pour boiling oil on the people below. Then we spotted an invading French army, fired a few arrows and prepared for battle. The boys loved it, more than I ever dared to hope.Now that the castle visit had gone so well, I decided to really push the boat out and visit Bateman's, the home of Rudyard Kipling. We'd be passing it on the way home so it seemed a shame not to pop in. My son wasn't so keen on this idea and was unimpressed when I played the Jungle Book card. In the end, I resorted to bribery.Whether you're a Kipling fan or not, Bateman's is worth a visit. It's a beautiful 17th century house surrounded by attractive, landscped gardens. However for me the visit was marred by the National Trust volunteers. Every time I entered a room they sprung up like meerkats and watched my every move. If my eyes rested on an object for more than three seconds, a voice behind me would start explaining its history. I soon began to find this oppressive. It seems churlish to complain, as each of the ladies was very nice and welcoming, but I just wanted to soak up the atmosphere of each room before learning the facts.I suppose we all want different things from historical places. For me, facts are less important than the opportunity to imagine what it must have been like to live there in the past. There are exceptions: the guided tours in Charleston Farmhouse are fascinating. But on the whole, I rather read about a place before going there, then spend my time soaking up the atmosphere."},
{"title": "Unimagined", "date": "Sunday, April 20, 2008", "text": "One of the most critically acclaimed biographies of 2007 was Unimagined by Imran Ahmad. It began life as a self-published memoir with a pretty awful jacket and might easily have suffered the fate of most self-published books, but when Scott Pack was chief buyer at Waterstone's he spotted its potential and asked Ahmad permission to forward Unimagined to an agent.A year later a hardback was published by Aurum and thanks to a combination of canny marketing by the author, glowing reviews in the press and word of mouth recommendations, the book was a great success. I really enjoyed Unimagined. In addition to giving an insight into the cultural clash between the demands of a Pakistani family and British society, Ahmad has written a warm, funny and touching memoir of growing up in the 1960s to 1980s.However I had another reason for reading Unimagined: I knew the author's brother.We met in our late teens at the local tertiary college, where we were both studying 'A' levels. I knew that his family were from Pakistan, but I can't remember being particularly conscious of what religion Imran's brother was. After an evening in the pub, he would stagger home, frantically sucking Polo mints to cancel out the smell of alcohol on his breath. My parents weren't keen on me drinking and I assumed that my friend's parents held similar views. I was woefully ignorant about Imran's family and their beliefs.In Unimagined, Imran Ahmad portrays his parents as being remarkably tolerant, whilst remaining faithful to their values. This tallies strongly with the impression I got. In hindsight they must have known what my friend got up to, but they wisely decided to turn a blind eye. Imran's brother was able to borrow his mother's car to drive to parties (and we had a few hairy journeys home) and when he said that he wanted to do a drama degree, he didn't encounter any serious opposition (as far as I know). He was allowed to enjoy the same freedoms as his peers.However once the degree was over, the traditional cultural expectations began to reassert themselves. A drama degree was fine, but now it was time to get a proper job in a bank. Then, in his mid-20s, the family began to discuss an arranged marriage. It was probably then that I first became aware of the cultural void that Imran and his brothers had to negotiate every day.Reading Unimagined has made me feel sad that my friend was so taciturn about his Muslim cultural heritage. When he was an undergraduate he even started to shorten his name to a more English-sounding one and seemed pleased that some people thought he was Italian. Was he hiding his true identity or trying to find a new one that successfully united the two disperate elements of past and present? Either way, he seems to have reconciled the different parts of his life as well as anyone could.Most of us have to negotiate cultural divides, whether they are between classes, generations, political viewpoints or working relationships, but it is hard to imagine what it is like to be a second generation British Asian, trying to succeed in the country that is your home without betraying your family's cultural values. That fact that Imran and his brothers have been so successful is a tribute to their strength of character and the wisdom of their parents."},
{"title": "The Corrections", "date": "Saturday, April 19, 2008", "text": "When it was published over six years ago, The Corrections received the rare accolade of universal critical acclaim. I bought the book immediately, but the more reviews I read the more reluctant I became to start reading it. Now that so many people had told me what a great novel it was, possibly the Great American Novel, I felt obliged to enjoy it. If my reactions were anything less than effusive it would be my failure, not the novel's.Soon friends started to recommend The Corrections and I discreetly moved it to the top of my bookcase so that people wouldn't be prompted to talk about it. Years passed, dust accumulated and the book became a member of my collection of books that I will probably never read. (These include Paul Theroux's My Secret History, Wuthering Heights, Sakarov's Peace, Progress and Intellectual Freedom and The Catcher in the Rye)Than last week, for no particular reason, I started reading it and from the first few pages I knew that I was reading a masterpiece. Most writing, indeed most art, only aspires to allude to universal truths, but Franzen actually dares to try and spell some of them out. The result is a novel that is both uncomfortable and comforting - the hallmarks of a great work of art. The Corrections makes the reader face some unpallatble truths, but offers solace in the knowledge that these experiences are part of the universal human condition."},
{"title": "East Anglia", "date": "Monday, April 14, 2008", "text": "I don't like East Anglia. It's very flat and there always seems to be a cold wind that penetrates even the most impermeable layers of clothing. Unfortunately my mother-in-law lives there and I usually have to go at least twice a year. She lives opposite a nuclear power station, which has recently been decommisioned but looks likely to gain a new lease of life as a processing centre for radioactive waste. I'm surprised there hasn't been any protest. Everyone in my wife's family has had cancer and a large number of their friends and neighbours have died from it. Perhaps it's just a coincidence, but it seems a lot higher than the national average of one in three people.Last week we went to stay there for a few days and I decided to challenge my preconceptions by exploring the region. I picked a route at random and set off with low expectations. Initially my prejudices were confirmed and I felt depressed by the monotonous, treeless landscape, but about 45 minutes into the journey I turned a corner and saw this:It looked a rather large church for a small, insignificant English village, so I decided to park the car and explore. I discovered that I was in Lavenham, which was once the 40th richest place in England, thanks to the wool  trade. During the late Middle Ages, Lavenham experienced an economic boom that enabled its burghers to build a church that looked more like a scaled-down cathedral.I entered the church and the interior was even more impressive. Everywhere I looked, there were memorials to Lavenham's most prominent citizens.Sadly, the poorer members of the community rest in anonymity, obscured by centuries of rain, wind and lichen:The village looks normal enough at a glance, but where most places might have a few medieval buildings, almost every house in Lavenham seems to be at least 500  years old.Houses like these seem to defy the rules of symetry and gravity, with upper floors leaning out at strange angles and yet I suspect that these buildings will last longer than many of their contemporary counterparts.So what's so special about Lavenham? The answer, apparently, is quite simple. The town's wool trade went into a sharp decline during the 16th century and the local people could no longer afford to replace or alter their existing buildings. The village effectively became frozen in time. Today Lavenham is on the tourist trail, but it is still a real community with over a hundred businesses. I was completely bowled over by the place and if you're ever in the area, I'd recommend a visit."},
{"title": "Unaccustomed as I am...", "date": "Monday, April 07, 2008", "text": "This evening I was the guest speaker at a meeting of the Society of Sussex Authors. It was slightly intimidating talking to a crowd of writers, but they were very welcoming and dutifully laughed at my anecdotes.I spoke about bookselling, focusing mainly on Waterstone's and gave a very candid account of how bookselling has changed during the last 20 years and concluded by talking about the Amazon Kindle, which I think has the potential to revolutionise the book industry during the next few years.I never took the E-book that seriously when it first appeared and I'm still not convinced by the Kindle, which has a depressingly grey screen. But it's only a matter of time before the technology is good enough to woo some readers away from the printed page.If you're a commuter and read thrillers, do you really need a proper book or would it be easier to download the text onto your E-book? And what about students? I doubt whether the romance of the printed page will save the textbook from becoming electronic.Real books won't disappear, but there may be a growing schism between the book as a work of art and the text as a disposable commodity. I think there will be room for both, but it will be interesting to see how far the E-book encroaches on the territory of traditional booksellers."},
{"title": "Brief encounter", "date": "Sunday, April 06, 2008", "text": "Some years ago I was in the National Gallery and saw a group of people huddled around a television screen showing a clip of Laurence Olivier doing the 'band of brothers' speech from Henry V. It was stirring stuff, but I kept being distracted by a man in the crowd who stood head and shoulders above everyone else. Apart from his height there was nothing unusual about his appearence, but he radiated a presence. In the end I became so distracted by the stranger in a beige raincoat that I edged forward to see what he looked like.It was Charlton Heston.The clip ended and Heston turned round. An American tourist in a wheelchair said 'Great to see you sir.' Heston smiled benevolently and thanked him.Heston has been a favourite actor of mine for years. His performance in the original Planet of the Apes film had a brooding intensity and who can forget the wonderful denouement, when Heston rages against the stupidity of mankind?But sadly there is also Charlton Heston, the gun-toting chairman of the National Rifle Association who spent his later years appearing in Dynasty. It is hard to reconcile the Heston of the 1960s, who supported Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights movement with the reactionary Republican of recent years. What happened? Was it the Alzheimers?"},

{"title": "The Death of Grass", "date": "Saturday, March 29, 2008", "text": "Thank God for the blogosphere. Last month I recommended several blogs, one of which was the excellent Bookseller Crow. Mr Crow found my recommendation and reciprocated by posting one of his own, the brilliant Caustic Cover Critic. I clicked on the link and found a kindred spirit - someone who has a fascination with apocalyptic novels. CCC recommended several books by John Christopher and as a result, I have read six of his novels within the last month.Yesterday I finished The Death of Grass, which is widely regarded as John Christopher's best work and has, regretably, been acclaimed as the finest science fiction novel of all time. I say regretably because this novel deserves a wider readership. If The Death of Grass is sci-fi, then so is Cormac McCarthy's The Road and a number of other novels I could mention. I believe that speculative or apocalyptic novels like these are a sub-genre within mainstream fiction.Christopher is no Cormac McCarthy, but The Death of Grass is a compelling novel about the human condition and in an age where we are increasingly concerned about the end of oil, it is as relevant as it was 50 years ago.Why isn't this book in print today? Like some of John Christopher's other novels, the dialogue and attitudes are dated. Do we really need to be told that a person is swarthy and  Jewish-looking unless it's somehow relevant to the narrative? Also, comments like 'the kind of failure in thoroughness that might be expected of Asiatics' will grate with most contemporary readers. However, for all its faults, The Death of Grass is an extraordinary, visionary novel.I think many of us are increasingly aware how fragile contemporary society is. It is not just the prospects of global warming, terrorism, nuclear war or the end of oil that threaten us, but also the fact that we are so interdependent. As individuals we are extremely vulnerable. Our grandparents' generation were more likely to know basic skills like growing vegetables, knitting, sewing and carpentry. What would we do today if the supply chain suddenly ground to a halt, for whatever reason?The Death of Grass offers the likely answer. In an over-populated country like Britain, the competition for resources would inevitably lead to social collapse within a short space of time. There is nothing like hunger to break down the veneer of civilisation.I hope that some forward-thinking publisher reissues this novel. With a decent jacket and an imaginative marketing campaign, The Death of Grass could find a whole new generation of readers. In the meantime, second-hand copies are selling for at least £25 on Ebay.NB - Penguin reissued this novel in 2009 as part of their Modern Classics series."},
{"title": "The Adventurous Four", "date": "Friday, March 28, 2008", "text": "I was quite a sickly child and at ten, spent a year in an old-fashioned sanitorium. I don't remember it as a particularly distressing time. On the contrary, the prospect of not going to school and spending all day reading Enid Blyton books seemed too good to be true. I read and re-read the Famous Five, Secret Seven, Five Find Outers and even the Naughtiest Girl series. I liked them much more than some of the worthy but dull children's classics I received as Christmas presents.I thought I'd read almost everything by Enid Blyton, but the other day I spotted a book in a charity shop called The Adventurous Four. It was only £1 (no full price books for me anymore), so I decided to buy it for my oldest son's bedtime story. At first he seemed underwhelmed by the narrative, but I persevered and by chapter five he was hooked, begging me not to stop.It's a corker of a story, written as a morale-booster for British children during the Second World War. The Adventurous Four consist of Tom, his twin sisters Jill and Mary and Andy, a local boy from the Scottish fishing village they are staying in. Their adventure begins when a simple boat trip goes horribly wrong and the children find themselves shipwrecked on a deserted island.I know that some people hate Enid Blyton's books for their implausible plots, casual racism, two-dimensional characters, negative portrayals of women, jolly hockysticks dialogue and leaden prose, but there is a reason for their enduring popularity. Blyton taps into every child's fantasy, creating a world in which children are almost completely independent. Parents, aunts and uncles are peripheral figures and seem quite unperturbed when their kids disappear for several days at a time. The only grown-ups who are allowed a more significant role in the narrative are the baddies.As I read The Adventurous Four to my son, it was clear that the main appeal of the story was the ingenuity of the children in dealing with the challenges they faced. When they successfully freed their shipwrecked boat from the rocks, he clapped his hands with excitement.  Blyton's world, in which children are independent, competent, courageous and resourceful  is far more attractive to the average eight-year-old child than some of the more critically acclaimed works of fiction.I hope that my son isn't too heavily influenced by Enid Blyton. A few weeks ago I found him digging a huge hole in the garden and only later remembered that we'd recently watched The Great Escape together. If he starts saying 'Dash it!' then I'll know who the culprit is."},

{"title": "The World in Winter", "date": "Tuesday, March 18, 2008", "text": "I've just finished my second John Christopher novel, The World in Winter, which was so compelling that I almost managed to read it in one sitting. Once again the parallels with John Wyndham were striking and I wonder if Christopher would be more popular today if he hadn't been consigned to the ghetto of science fiction. My edition was published by the SF/fantasy publisher Sphere and if I'd seen it on the shelf I wouldn't have bothered picking it up.John Wyndham used to complain that his novels were speculative fiction rather than SF - a term that has since been adopted by many authors. Margaret Atwood used it to describe her brilliant novel Oryx and Crake, claiming that speculative fiction is a genre in its own right. I'm sure that if John Christopher was 'rebranded ' as one of the finest exponents of this genre, he might start to receive the recognition he deserves.As for the book itself, it begins as a straightforward catastrophe story in which Britain quickly finds itself in the grip of a new ice age. At first life continues as normal but when spring fails to materialise, rationing and martial law are swiftly followed by rioting, looting and social collapse. At this point the novel suddenly changes gear and it soon becomes apparent what the novel's true purpose is.I will not give the plot away, except to say that this is a story about racial prejudice and the relationship between Britain and its former colonies in Africa. From a present day perspective it makes an uncomfortable read and I suspect that one reason why it hasn't been reprinted by a mainstream publisher is the preponderance of words like negro, nigger, sambo, mammy and darkie. It is also hard to see where Christopher is coming from. Is he bravely confronting the ugly realities of racism or giving voices to his own prejudices? On the one hand the novel seems to delight in seeing the relationship between black and white reversed - a reflection of the fact that Britain's African colonies were all gaining independence during this period. But at times it felt as if the demise of the white man is the novel's true disaster. This would certainly be a good book for reading groups to discuss!Next on the list is The Death of Grass if I can find a copy that doesn't cost the earth. At the moment they seem to be selling on Ebay for at least £30, even for a battered old Penguin, so it might be some time before I read it. Perhaps I'll sell a few unwanted CDs to pay for it, as my financial circumstances are a little precarious at the moment (I'll explain why in the next post)."},
{"title": "Ends of the World", "date": "Saturday, March 15, 2008", "text": "One of the best book related blogs I've read recently is Caustic Cover Critic, which claims that it is one man's endless ranting about book design, but in fact is so much more.A common thread running through his blog is dystopian fiction and after reading a posting about John Christopher, the scandalously neglected author of the Tripods trilogy, I decided to try one of his adult novels, A Wrinkle in the Skin.Caustic Cover Critic (henceforth to known as CCC) has made favourable comparisons to John Wyndham and on the strength of this novel I would agree. John Christopher may not be Dostoyevsky, but A Wrinkle in the Skin was an intelligent, well-paced novel with believable characters and a scenario that was depressingly plausible once you'd got past the fairly implausible premise.In a nutshell, a series of huge earthquakes rocks the planet, destroying almost every building and killing the vast majority of the population. The world that remains is reminiscent of the excellent BBC drama series Survivors, although in this novel there aren't even homes to provide sanctuary. The remaining humans inherit a world in which the infrastructures of modern life have been completely destroyed and there are insufficient crops and animals left to provide them with food.How would people behave in this situation? Would we ensure our mutual survival through co-operation or would the strong prey mercilessly on the weak? In Christopher's world, some humans will try to maintain the remnants of civilisation whilst others will quickly regress to a state in which murder, rape and theft become the norm. In a telling passage, the main character is upbraided for his naivety by a woman who has been attacked several times:What was your idea of what's happened? Who do you think survived? Just the teachers and bank clerks and local government officers, with some nice honest policemen, and perhaps the chief constable of the county as President? That's the way it ought to have been. But things weren't done nearly as neatly as that. What did you expect, for God's sake? The orderly people, the people who could plan more than a few days ahead, have always been in a minority.According to CCC, Christopher has written better novels than this so I look forward to reading them. The Death of Grass has been voted the best science fiction novel of all time and The World in Winter is supposed to be very good too. So why are most of John Christopher's novels either out of print or available in crude reprints?On the strength of A Wrinkle in the Skin, I am impressed by John Christopher, or Sam Youd, to use his real name.Aside from the fact that I approve of any writer who wears a cravat (not sure about the specs though), I can't understand why so many of Sam Youd's novels are unavailable when John Wyndham's remain in print. Let's hope that an enlightened publisher remedies this situation.In the meantime, if you have any interest in dystopian, post-apocalyptic novels, here is an excellent list on Wikipedia."},
{"title": "His Excellency Eugene Rougon", "date": "Friday, March 14, 2008", "text": "The sixth book in Zola's Rougon-Macquart is an improvement on its predecessor but it's easy to see why no-one has commissioned a modern translation. The plot of the novel is as follows: Eugene Rougon, who is one of the chief figures in Napoleon III's government, is forced to resign. He spends a while in the political wilderness until he makes a spectacular comeback. Sadly he gets too big for his boots and ends up having to resign again. Then he starts to make another comeback. The end.As a novel His Excellency doesn't work. The plot creaks along slowly and when it does change gear it is done in a way that is clumsy and uncompelling. However the book does have its merits. On the one hand it is a fascinating portrait of France during the rule of Louis Napoleon and even features the Emperor as one of the characters. Zola is clearly not a fan of the Second Empire, but his portrait of Napoleon III is balanced and plausible. Some of the historical references went over my head, but luckily I found a copy of the Penguin History of Modern France in a local charity shop for £1.In Zola's novels, France in the mid-nineteenth century is ruled by a cabal of corrupt, greedy politicians who are more concerned with lining their own pockets (and those of their friends) than the glory of France. The historical accuracy of the Rougon Macquart novels is one of their chief merits, but at times I think the demands of fiction are subservient to Zola's desire for authenticity. His Excellency is a case in point."},
{"title": "Post script", "date": "Friday, March 07, 2008", "text": "When I was 11-years-old I became friends with a boy whose parents were divorced. I'd never met anyone whose mother and father lived apart and I remember feeling quite jealous that he had two homes. In my eyes divorce had a glamorous, film star quality about it and this was compounded when I first met the father, a dashing, ex-army man who spoke in clipped tones and drove a fast car.Every Sunday he drove us to an army range near Aldershot, where we would scour the scorched heathland for abandoned cartridges, bullets and clips, which we would later assemble into machine gun belts and parade around the streets like Mexican bandits. Occasionally we found live ammunition and once I decided to sneak a few rounds home. Later, in my father's garage, I placed the cartridges in a vice and prepared to strike them with a hammer. My dad's unexpected entrance probably saved my life. He was utterly appalled and I've always wondered whether this incident prompted him to encourage me to collect stamps.It worked. I soon lost interest in weapons and became obsessed with my stamp collection, visiting stamps fairs and dealers every week. I kept a meticulous record of my purchases and noted the catalogue value of each item and how much of a profit I had made. I was quite the young businessman.Then puberty arrived and almost overnight, the stamp collection lost its allure.  My albums went into storage and ever since I have been convinced that I was sitting on a small fortune which I could cash in on a rainy day. Recently the rainy day arrived and I dusted down the albums and looked at the stamps for the first time in years.I was struck both by the futility of stamp collecting and the beauty of some of the stamps. For example, this King George VI stamp from Trinidad and Tobago is a minor work of art:But what about their value? I decided to check the internet and see how much they had increased in price. After several hours of exhaustive searching and careful cross-referencing I discovered that my great collection, the result of several years' labour, is worth bugger all.There seems to have been some sort of Wall Street Crash in the stamp world, or maybe a South Sea Bubble. Either way, many are worth no more than their face value. Indeed I might start using my 1970s mint condition British stamps on normal correspondence. As for the George VI high value definitives, which included the rare 10/- dark blue, I manged to sell them on Ebay for less than a fiver.What a waste of time.

It was hardly a controversial claim. When I was a student, everyone I knew joked about the nautical double entendres that went over their heads when they were kids.Little did Tibballs realise that his casual reference would nearly result in the book being pulped within weeks of publication.Apparently the creator of Pugwash, John Ryan, got wind of Tibballs' anecdote and took great offence. It was, he claimed, completely untrue that there were any sexual innuendos in Captain Pugwash and Ryan was outraged that these rumours were given credence by appearing in print. Ryan decided to take matters further. Legal action was threatened and Titan Books were faced with the prospect of having to withdraw the book and pulp it.Fortunately a compromise was reached (albeit a rather silly one) and stickers were sent out to every bookshop in the land accompanied by a letter asking for them to be placed in every copy. I kept a spare one and have treasured it ever since!So apparently we were all wrong. There were no rude names in Captain Pugwash and the rumour must have been an urban myth. How disappointing.I forgot all about this story until yesterday, when I decided to watch a DVD of Pugwash that came free with a newspaper a few weeks ago. After the opening credits had finished, Captain Pugwash appeared on the ship's deck and started issuing orders to a character called Master Bates.Master Bates?I pressed rewind just to make sure that I wasn't mis-hearing it.So was Ryan fibbing when he denied the innuendo, or did he and the crew responsible for Captain Pugwash fail to spot the obvious unfortunate connotations? I know that it was a more innocent age, but even so...I watched the remaining episodes, desperately hoping that the mythical Seaman Stains would appear, but sadly he didn't exist.POST SCRIPT - I have informed by more than one source that it is Master Mates, not Bates (although it sounds suspiciously like Bates), so I stand corrected. However, I forgot to mention that one of the other characters was called Pirate Willy, so as far as I'm concerned the jury's still out!"},
{"title": "The Sin of Father Mouret", "date": "Wednesday, February 27, 2008", "text": "Zut alors! The fifth book in Zola's Rougon Macquart series achieved the remarkable feet of being completely mad, but also incredibly dull. The plot is straightforward enough: a fanatical priest has a nervous breakdown, gets sent to a remote country house to recuperate, falls in love with a 16-year-old girl, gets her up the duff, returns to the priesthood and drives her to suicide. That will save you from ever having to read the book.For a so-called realist, Zola seems to have been under the influence of something when he wrote this book, with its interminable descriptions of plants and the crude metaphors for the fecundity of nature. The result reads like Gardeners World meets Debbie Does Dallas (not that I've ever watched Gardeners World, you understand), but is considerably less entertaining.It's strange how such a great writer can be so erratic. I could understand if he was an enfant terrible who went off the boil or, conversely, got better with each work. But with the Rougon Macquart novels, the quality varies dramatically from book to book.I'm now reading the sixth book, His Excellency Eugene Rougon and although the jury's still out, it's a definite improvement on its predecessor, thank God. Once that's finished I can reward myself with the first of Zola's great novels, L'assamoir. I can't wait."},

She knows that like most men of my age I have a thing about Jenny Agutter, but has it reached the point where I'm buying dodgy DVDs of films she made when she was underage?I try to explain the plot of the film, saying that she plays a schoolgirl but I realise that I'm digging deeper. Admittedly the sight of Jenny Agutter in school uniform appealed to me when I first saw the film, but in mitigation I was a schoolboy at the time. What impressed me most was the ordinariness of the setting and Agutter's brilliant performance and I have wanted to see the film again for years, but it has never been released on DVD.I convince my wife that if she watches the film with me, she'll understand its appeal. She is still not convinced but agrees to see the beginning with me. Ten hours later we are sitting on the sofa watching the film and within minutes my wife agrees that it is brilliant.I Start Counting was filmed in 1968 and is set in an anonymous new town in the south of England. The film is ostensibly a murder mystery, but the thriller element is incidental as the real theme of the movie is change and growth. We see Jenny Agutter's character changing from a child into an adult against a backdrop of a town where old buildings and a traditional way of life are being destroyed to make way for the new. As for Agutter's acting, it was one of the best things I've ever seen.It's a mystery why this wonderful film hasn't been commercially released when so much rubbish is available on DVD. I would have thought that Agutter's name alone would guarantee commercial success.

Through the glass I can see a huge black man who looks as if he could beat up Mr T with his little finger. He has no discernible neck and seems to consist of pure muscle. During the five seconds that it takes for the doors to open, I have already managed to imagine a whole life for him and wonder what it must be like to know that you could beat the crap out of anyone you liked. What would I do with that power?The doors open and I notice that he's holding a paperback in his right hand. A novel. As we pass each other I quickly look down to see what the book is. If I was locked in a room for a month, I would never guess the answer.He's reading Catherine Cookson."},

Literally. Every item would have been dumped in a landfill site if the staff at the local refuse and recycling centre hadn't rescued them from people's dustbin bags. This is the room where all of the retrieved items are kept. There are CDs, picture frames, a bird cage, a four-volume Cassell History of England and, for some unknown reason, hundreds of golf balls.I realise that VHS cassettes are now obsolete, although I would have thought that there are enough people with VCRs who would happily pay a nominal sum for many of these titles. It is appalling to think that they are probably going to end up buried in the ground, poisoning the soil.But what really hurt was the books. I can't bring myself to throw any books away, not because I think they're sacred (I've worked too long in the book trade for that) but because I know that there are people out there who will read them. The books in the photo included novels by Stephen King, John Grisham, Peter Robinson, Josephine Cox, Michael Crichton and James Patterson - all bestselling authors. I'm sure that if these books' owners had bothered donating them to the local charity shop then they would have sold.I visited this dump earlier today and deliberately took my son with me, as he's going through a very materialistic phase and spends most of his spare time pouring through the Argos catalogue. So far I've failed to win him over and when, last week, I spent ten minutes explaining clearly and concisely why money doesn't bring happiness he replied 'Dad, that's the most stupid argument I've ever heard.'However today I think I made an impression. He seemed genuinely shocked by the piles of discarded computer monitors, televisions and electrical goods and when we entered the hut with the books, I saw a look of dismay and incredulity. We walked back to the car in silence as if we were leaving a burial. I wondered what the world would be like for my son's generation and whether we would be able to change things before it was too late, then he looked at me and said 'Dad, can I buy a fish tank?'"},
{"title": "What happens to the Christmas trees?", "date": "Saturday, February 16, 2008", "text": "During the second week of January, a van drives around the local streets collecting people's redundant Christmas trees for a mere two pounds (which goes to charity). This year we had the smallest tree in the street by far. I like to think that this is because we are not vulgar and ostentatious. Our neighbours would say it's because we can't afford a decent tree.Although it was small enough to throw in a bin, we dutifully paid up and watched our tree disappear to...well, where? Where do Christmas trees go? Are they burned in a huge Viking-style funeral pyre, pulped in a big Christmas tree crushing machine, or turned into Ikea furniture? To be honest I'd never really given the matter that much thought, but whether I cared or not, today I had my answer.Some miles away there is an area of woodland which has been traced back to prehistoric times. It is very peaceful and the only sounds you can hear are birdsong, the twigs cracking underneath your feet and the panting of an approaching libidinous German shepherd.But just beyond these woods there is a clearing, full of tiny Christmas trees...I assumed that these conifers were part of an ordinary plantation, but during a visit today I noticed a baubel, dangling from one of the lower branches of a tree, then I spotted some tinsel and holly. This is where our Christmas trees go. Not to die, but to recover until they're ready for the next pantomime season."},

Every time a politician, public servant or businessman is being grilled by the media, they invariably mention this word at some point in the interview and it seems as if no Government initiative is worth it's salt unless it's 'robust'.In the context of interviews, people usually use robust to describe a remedy for a balls-up. We don't want to hear the truth, which is 'We buggered it up but next time we'll try to be less crap' so instead we're told that measures are being introduced which will be more robust. Occasionally it's deemed necessary to introduce measures that are robust and resilient.I would like to impose a cliche tax that would be imposed every time certain words or phrases were uttered.

{"title": "The Conquest of Plassans", "date": "Sunday, February 10, 2008", "text": "I have just finished the fourth book in Zola's Rougon-Macquart series of novels - only another sixteen  to go. I might die first.I started my quest in August 2006 which I realise is rather slow, but that's the only way I could face doing it. The received wisdom is that whilst Zola is a great writer he was also an erratic one and at least half of the Rougon Macquart novels aren't very good, which is why no modern translations exist for them.I approached reading all twenty books like a marathon (not that I've ever run one).I'd start full of energy and although the first six books weren't great I'd have the promise of L'assamoir (or The Drinking Den as it now seems to be called) to aim for. From then on, as my spirits flagged, the number of refreshment breaks would increase: Nana, Germinal, Earth, La Bete Humaine and The Debacle to get me through to the final novel, Doctor Pascal. However, after struggling through the third book - The Fat and the Thin - I was surprised to find myself completely bowled over by The Conquest of Plassans.Zola was a social realist and his descriptions of France during the Second Empire are incredibly vivid. But sometimes, when Zola switches into panoramic mode, he gets carried away. The third novel  successfully evokes the atmosphere of  the Parisian markets, but there are only so many descriptions of fruit, vegetables and fish that one needs. As Roxette sang, Don't bore us, get to the chorus. I approached The Conquest of Plassans with all the enthusiasm of someone reading a set text, but within a few pages I was hooked. The strength of this novel lies with the main characters, from the Rasputin-like Abbe Faujas to Francois Mouret, who is the nearest thing that French literature has to Homer Simpson. This was almost a great novel and it's a mystery why no modern translation exists.Apart from the sharply-drawn characters, the other asset of this novel is that the narrative rarely flags and Zola resists the urge to describe every single item on a table. It is only let down by the unnecessarily melodramatic James Bond ending, which seems out of character with the subtle interplay of the first 280 pages. But that aside, this is a very enjoyable read and if you don't want to trawl through all twenty novels in the Rougon Macquart sequence, I'd strongly recommend La Conquete."},

The other day I visited one of their restaurants for the first time in years, forced there by torrential rain, insatiable hunger and the absence of any alternative.At first everything looked normal. There were the usual crackhead mums shoving fries into toothless infants whilst checking their phones for texts, a couple of old ladies hiding in the corner wistfully remembering the Lyons tea rooms and a lad in a shell suit who wasn't eating anything but seemed to be enjoying the atmosphere, judging by the moronic grin on his face.But the food was completely different - healthy salads, fruit juices and wraps seemed to dominate the menu. Where were the quarterpounders dripping in grease, or the milkshakes consisting of 22 sugars and wood pulp (allegedly)?I tentatively approached the counter and asked for one quarterpounder and a medium strawberry shake (I took great care to remember to omit the word milk). A girl with very poor skin looked up and asked 'Dwanamildil?' Thinking that there was a misunderstanding, I repeated my order and she repeated her question, adding 'It's cheapar.' I nodded and paid double what I was expecting before being told that I would have to wait. Wait! What has happened to fast food?Five minutes later, Fagash Lil ambled over and wiped my table. My God, it's almost waitress service now. I felt as if I had been in a coma for twenty years.This must be the post-Supersize Me McDonald's, trying to claw back its market share after several years of declining sales. It was a strange experience, but I'm relieved to say that the quarterpounder and milkshake tasted the same as they did in 1994, right down to those bloody gherkins. Indeed, like cockroaches after a nuclear holocaust, I bet the gherkins will still be there in 50 years' time.I am not down-shifting, as I never up-shifted in the first place, but my financial circumstances are becoming a little precarious and I've recently embarked on a drive to live more frugally. At first the prospect of tightening the purse strings seemed fairly depressing, but the reality has been quite different. Indeed, in many ways it has been liberating.Until I sat down and looked at our finances I had no idea how much money we were wasting, either by buying things we didn't need or paying too much when cheaper alternatives were available.With these few simple actions I have saved over a thousand pounds:Renting DVDs instead of buying themGetting gas and electricity from the same supplierBuying as many 'value range' dry goods as possible at the supermarketsJoining the local toy librarySelling stuff on EbayEbay has been particularly useful. I have been selling proof copies and first editions of novels and although the results have been mixed (15 pounds for a proof of Ian McEwan's Amsterdam, but no takers for a signed first edition of Saturday) I have made a bit of money and cleared some space. I've also sold DVDs and CDs and as I parcel up each sold item, I feel a sense of relief. The house is becoming emptier and more manageable.It's strange how, within two generations, we've gone from being oppressed by an absence of things to an excess of possessions. My mother remembers the constant worry of not having enough money to buy essential things like clothes. Today, many wardrobes are bulging with unworn items.I think things will change - they have to - and it's possible that the end of the consumer society as we know it will spell disaster, as our whole economy is based on persuading people to buy things they don't need. However, as long as we're not starving or shivering, we may be better off for it."},

The worst thing is that a lot of what he says make sense. Maybe there's a Muslim fundamentalist inside me waiting to get out, as I also once found myself thinking that Bin Laden had a point as well.

What would you recommend?Me -                     Has he tried Rankin?Customer -     Wanking? Yes, well that would certainly keep him quiet...The most bizarre aspect of this counter was the woman's completely unfazed response to what she thought I'd said.***********************************************************************************The belated fame of this anecdote made me think of a few other bookshop stories that deserve to be told.

When you read it, imagine that both the customer and bookseller have very strong London accents...Bookseller -    Can I help?Customer -     'Ave you got Henry V?Bookseller -     We should 'ave. Do you want an Arden?Customer -     No, I want a soft'un************************************************************************************Customer - I want a copy of *mentions very obscure book title*Bookseller - Sorry, I'm not familiar with that. Is it new?Customer - New! No it certainly isn't! Don't you know anything about books?\"Bookseller - Well I'm sorry, but we're all experts in different fields. For example, I'm studying medieval art and you probably haven't heard of Hugo de Vries.Customer - Yes, of course I have.Bookseller - Well you can't have done, as I just made him up.************************************************************************************And I remember several awkward questions like...'What do I give someone who only has two weeks to live?' (I suggested a book of short stories)'I want a book with a moral dilemma in it.' (Er...the Fiction section's over there mate)'My wife's allergic to the smells of most books. Have you any that would be suitable for her?''Where's your Tundra section?''Do you read?' (To which I politely replied 'Yes I do. Do you?')'Why does your Fiction section only go up to G?' (Just for fun, I told them that H-Z was in the Kingston branch)'Can you order me a book in time for Christmas Day?' (Asked at 2.30pm on Christmas Eve)'Have you got any books on sex with animals?''Why don't people like nice things anymore?' (When told that we didn't have any Patience Strong in stock)'How will I find it?' (Asked by customers who are unaware that Fiction is, and always has been, arranged A-Z by author)\"Where's your section of coffee table books on Paraguay?\"\"You have a degree? In what? Shoelaces?\"\"Why are all the books I want on the top floor?\" 'Yuhejub?' (\"Do you have a job?\", as asked by people who think that a very rudimentary grasp of English shouldn't be an impediment to working in a bookshop)Then there was the customer who wanted a book of walks that only featured Suffolk and Worcestershire - two counties that are 150 miles apart - because he lived in Suffolk but had a friend in Worcestershire.And in addition to the strange enquiries, there are also those people who think that bookshops sell chairs, kettles, fishing rods and kitchenware.Mind you, the way things are going it's only a matter of time.I'm know that there are some superb anecdotes lurking within the recesses of my memory, but this is all I can remember at the moment.

The same applies to verbs like networking, upgrading and downloading. But gifting?A cursory glance at the internet shows that the word hasn't quite caught on, although it's only a matter of time before the relentless growth of retail adds this vile word to our lexicon. And just to make it even worse, I found regifting, which is what you do when you pass an unwanted present onto some other poor bastard.

That's how I discovered this book - the work of a philosopher whose reputation rested on his pioneering work with the animal liberation movement.If I was a dictator I would ban at least 95% of the self-help/popular psychology books in print and give everyone a free copy of Peter Singer's wonderful book about ethics in an age of uncertainty. In simple, commonsense language, Singer not only discusses some of the dilemmas of modern life but also dares to come up with a blueprint for living the good life. In a nutshell, he says: treat other people they way you'd want them to treat you, but don't take any crap. You might think that's blindingly obvious, but this simple common sense has eluded thinkers like Plato and Jesus.Peter Singer - sheep may safely grazeThis book was my staff recommendation in Crawley - a town where many grandmothers are still looking forward to their 30th birthdays - and to my amazement I sold more than any other title I'd picked. At first the book cost 8.99, but every few months it would go into reprint and reappear at a higher price. Eventually, Oxford University Press increased the cover price to a level that made it impossible to sell the book. This was a great pity. I wonder how many they're selling now.I have thought about Singer's book a lot recently as I have been faced with several ethical dilemmas in the last year and it has made me realise how marginalised the subject of ethics has become. We use the word ethical more than ever in our daily lives, but usually as consumers. Questions of good and evil seem to be largely reserved for theologians, but in today's secular society we need to re-establish a common ground that can partially fill the void left by the moral certainties of the past. We could do worse than start with Peter Singer's book."},

Nobody knows how old it is or why it's there, although the general consensus is that it's a few thousand years old. Is he a fertility symbol, a warning to enemy tribes, a tribute to the gods or simply a primitive work of art?During the Second World War he was painted green to stop the Luftwaffe using him as a landmark. Recently he was given a makeover by fashion gurus Trinny and Suzanna on their television show, causing a storm of protest from outraged pagans and members of English heritage.It seemed appropriate to spend part of New Year's Day visiting something very old and as I'd already seen my mother at Christmas, this was a good second choice.I can't say I'm feeling very optimistic about the coming year.

I can't think of a more deserving author. There are few writers who have done so much to get children reading, particularly children from deprived backgrounds. Also, she has worked tirelessly to promote reading and although she probably became a millionaire several years ago, she hasn't retreated to an ivory tower. Every fan letter receives a personal reply and when she does one of her famous signing sessions, Jacqueline Wilson won't leave until she's talked to the last child in the queue.At this point I have to declare an interest -I've done two events with her (the first of which was the biggest signing session of her career to date) and she was the nicest author I've ever met.At the first session, neither Jacqui or I had any idea how big the signing was going to be, but I think we'd both estimated that three to four hours would be enough. In the event I think I'd slightly overdone things on the publicity front and we had a queue that was a quarter of a mile long. Many authors would have insisted on capping the queue after an hour, but Jacqueline Wilson was just delighted that so many people had turned up and the signing lasted for almost eight hours! It was the highlight of my bookselling career.During the whole session, Jacqueline Wilson didn't take a single break. Afterwards I asked her what her secret was and she replied 'A strong wrist and a cast-iron bladder.'What impressed me most of all was the way Jacqueline Wilson dealt with her readers. She must have talked to hundreds of people that day, but she made every child feel special and the welcoming smile never wavered. She spent at least a minute chatting to each person and agreed to every request for photographs. It would be easy to assume that this was an example of a writer trying to ingratiate themselves with their reading public, but Jacqui had made her money and didn't need to do these marathon signing sessions to raise her profile.Some people are very dismissive about the literary merits of Jacqueline Wilson's novels, but when you see a queue of hundreds of excited children it is impossible to be cynical. Wilson has not earned her popularity by appealing to the lowest common denominator. Her popularity rests on her ability to discuss serious issues in a way that entertains, comforts and never, ever patronizes the reader.Two years after the first signing  I held another and had  the rather surreal experience of riding on a carousel  with Jacqui (it's a long story).  After the ride I took this picture:See the name on the horse?The British honours system is a strange, imperfect anachronism but on this occasion, the decision to make Jacqueline Wilson a dame was a wise one."},
{"title": "Patrick Hamilton", "date": "Sunday, December 23, 2007", "text": "Some books take time and perseverance to reveal their charms whilst others begin brilliantly but somehow lose their way. Patrick Hamilton's Slaves of Solitude gripped me from the first page and remained utterly compelling until the end.After his death, Hamilton was compared unfavourably to contemporaries like Orwell and Greene, but this novel is a remarkable achievement and I'm amazed that a man who drank three bottles of whisky a day was able to write such a profound and sober assessment of human nature.On the surface very little happens. The main character is a 39-year-old woman who has fled the Blitz for a boarding house in a thinly disguised Henley-on-Thames and the novel chronicles her relationships with the other boarders and the threats to her purgatorial equilibrium posed by an American GI and a German friend. However the genius of this novel lies in Hamilton's ability to conjure up the claustrophobic atmosphere of the English boarding house with its petty resentments and unspoken feuds. I stress English boarding house because I cannot imagine this novel taking place in a country like Italy, where people would be less inclined to silently seethe with anger.The Slaves of Solitude takes supposedly typically English qualities like good manners, self-control and decorum and shows how underneath the facade of civility, people are consumed by hatred, resentment, jealousy and lust. Hamilton's portrayal of the inner life of Miss Enid Roach is a masterly microcosm of English society in the mid-20th century.The War is ever present, but rather than heightening the novel's sense of drama it merely acts as a dull backdrop - an enervating fog of rations, blackouts and uncertainty. The distant drone of enemy planes occasionally punctuates the silence of the night, but life is elsewhere and the aircraft never bother dropping their bombs on this drab, provincial town. This is an England that I never knew, but one that I caught glimpses of as a child. I can taste the flavourless, watery soup served to the guests of the Rosamund Tea Rooms and imagine the sterile atmopshere of the dining room, with its whispered conversations and clinking cutlery.As for Patrick Hamilton, he was one of the most prominent writers of his day. In addition to his novels, he wrote the screenplays for two of the most successful Hollywoood films of the 40s - Rope and Gaslight. His early years were marked by poverty but he became that rare creature, a financially secure writer and like many successful novelists, he was the victim of a posthumous backlash. Hopefully the pendulum has swung back because the Slaves of Solitude is, without a doubt, one of the great English novels of the 20th century."},

I hadn't a clue what they were talking about until, two days later, a DVD arrived of a Swedish film called Ondskan, translated into English as Evil.  It was brilliant and the next day I recommended it to a notoriously curmudgeonly colleague at work, almost certain that he'd find something wrong with the film. He loved it too.Set around fifty years ago in an exclusive Swedish boarding school, Ondskan is a savage indictment of the type of institutionalised bullying that is bizarrely regarded as character building. The lead actor - Andreas Wilson - is incredibly charismatic and with the 50s setting the result looks like a cross between Tom Brown's Schooldays and Rebel Without a Cause.  Sort of.But Ondskan isn't some public school romp with Nordic Flashmans. This is a highly intelligent and compelling film about morality and the lead character's refusal to submit to the injustices of others will have you hooked. I promise."},

Brass chords surged and swelled, whilst the percussion section issued menacing rumbles and roars. And all the time, the choir sang of death and destruction, wreaked by an enigmatic group of gods called the Seven:                        Seven                                  are                                  they,                         In                                  the Ocean Deep seven are                                  they,                                                          Evil are they, evil are                                  they,                                                          Seven are they,Twice seven are                                  they!                                                          By Heaven be ye                                  exorcised!                                                          By Earth be ye exorcised.The words were sang in Russian and the repetitive chanting of sem, sem, sem gave the music a hypnotic, ritualistic quality. I wondered which contemporary composer had written this powerful music. I thought it might be Sofia Gubaidulina, whose St John's Passion had transfixed me during a car journey to B&Q, but there was something very male about the music. I racked my brains for other likely contenders, but had to give up.The music finished, the audience applauded and an announcer who looked about 12-years-old said that the music was by Prokofiev. I was amazed, particulary when I discovered that Seven, They Are Seven was an early work, first performed 90 years ago. The words are apparently from a Mesopotamian cuneiform from the 3rd century BCI realise that this is probably of no interest to you (and thank you for reading this far), but this was a remarkable piece of music, quite unlike anything I've heard and I think it would also appeal to people who don't like classical music. Sadly, despite Prokofiev's stature as a composer, recordings of Seven seem to be thin on the ground."},

How little I knew. As I grew older I experienced one bizarre event after another and began to realise that anything could happen.Last week I went to take part in an aptitude test session at Tolworth Tower - a grim, 1960s office block surrounded by roads in a desolate place on the border between the London suburbs and Surrey. When I booked the tests I was asked if I knew where the tower was. I said I had been there before, but didn't mention that it was when I was 17 and on my first date. I wanted to ask a girl out but didn't quite know how to go about it, then hit on what seemed like the brilliant idea of going tenpin bowling. We met at the bus stop and travelled the eight miles to Tolworth Tower's bowling alley.I thought the day had gone well but she obviously didn't share my views and I never saw her again. I resolved to abandon tenpin bowling as part of my wooing technique.After the aptitude test I decided to catch the train to Twickenham and revisit the places I had known since childhood. There were a few changes. Every other building seemed to be a restaurant and what had once been a very English area had been augmented by Slavic faces with beautiful cheekbones, Africans and Asians. I had grown up here but searched in vain for a familiar face.I walked down to the River Thames - this part of Twickenham hadn't changed much in 250 years - and visited the church where my parents married and I was Christened. It was empty and after lighting a candle for my father, I studied a noticeboard to see if I recognised any of the photos of the members of the parish council. They were all strangers. How can you grow up somewhere, attend school with nearly a thousand other local children and, within a short space of time, feel like a stranger? Where had everyone gone? I began to feel slightly depressed.Suddenly the church door swung open and a woman asked me if would be much longer. I explained that I was about to leave. 'Okay that's fine.' she replied 'When you go can you make sure that you shut the door very firmly - you really have to slam it.' I nodded and just as she was leaving I realised who she was. I wanted to rush after her and say how strange it was that after visiting Tolworth Tower for the first time since our one and only date, I should bump into her like this, but by the time I had obediently slammed the church door shut, she had vanished."},
{"title": "The joys of Christmas", "date": "Thursday, November 22, 2007", "text": "One of the most frustrating aspects of running a bookshop is the number of unsolicited phone calls I receive at Christmas from self-published authors and small publishers. The last ten weeks of the year is make or break time in bookselling and if I'm going to spend time on the phone, I'd rather be selling a book to a customer than listening to someone waffle on about their definitive history of telephone boxes of the 1930s.Last week a self-published author phoned during a particularly busy time and I asked her to send me an email, which she promptly did. Later, during a quiet moment at the till I, read the author's description of her book. On the basis that she wasn't a local author, hadn't arranged any publicity for the book and was writing about a fairly esoteric subject, I decided not to stock it. That should have been the end of it.A few days later she rang back and was very abrupt with one of my staff. I was busy dealing with a long enquiry and couldn't talk to her. The next day she managed to track me down and asked if I was going to stock her book. At first I wasn't sure which title she was talking about as I've had so many calls like this recently. The conversation went like this:'I really think you should stock this title''Are you a local author''No, I live in **** *******''And why do you think that I should stock this book'The author told me how interesting and well-written their book was, which led me to the next question:'What sort of publicity have you arranged?'I've had some local newspaper articles, but nothing in your area. I'm hoping that it will be picked up by a national paper''I've no doubt it's a very good book, but I have trouble selling titles by Penguin that have been backed by a marketing spend of thousands of pounds, so unless you can guarantee some sort of publicity I don't think I'll be able to sell it.'We agreed to differ.I gave the author some advice on how to publicise her book and encouraged her to try local radio, promising to stock the title if she did this. She probably thought I was being a bit of a bastard but in the past, if you visited the stock room of any bookshop you'd find hundreds, sometimes thousands of pounds worth of unsold books from small publishers and self-published authors. These titles were bought on a sale or return basis, but it's interesting how the person that hassled you every day before Christmas could be so elusive when you tried to send the books back. And if you did track them down, returning the books was a lengthy, time consuming process. Instead of picking 400 books and sending them back to HarperCollins, you had to do dozens of small consignments with separate forms for each one.There's nothing I like more than seeing a small publisher or self-published author succeed and, contrary to the tone of this post, I always try to be open minded when an author approaches me. But it is frustrating how many people publish books without doing any research into the book trade, make no effort to get publicity and then phone bookshop managers at the busiest time of the year."},

{"title": "Thrillers", "date": "Thursday, November 15, 2007", "text": "I don't read thrillers. I can't see the point in reading something that offers nothing more than a routine television drama. The best novels not only entertain the reader but also provide an insight into the human condition, whether they merely ratify your own view of the world or open you up to new possibilities. However, last week I decided to break the habit of a lifetime and read a proper thriller called The Death List by Paul Johnston.It was almost exactly what I expected and confirmed all my prejudices about the genre, but there was one surprise: I couldn't put it down. The plot was implausible and the characters were superficial, but the author had placed his hero in such an appalling situation that I had to find out what happened next. I read the book in a day, refusing all offers of human contact until I had reached the end. Afterwards I felt dirty, as if had just eaten a bag of jam doughnuts.What was particularly interesting about The Death List was the fact that the main character was an author who'd been dropped by his publisher. There were lots of bitchy comments about the publishing world and I wondered if this was connected to the fact the Paul Johnston is now with Mira - an imprint of Mills and Boon - rather than his old publisher Hodder and Stoughton.I checked the reviews on Amazon. Some readers loved it but others thought the novel was 'implausible' and that the characters were 'two-dimensional', which is like complaining that there's too much fighting in a Bruce Lee film.That should have been the end of it, but a few days later I found myself reading another thriller - this time by Simon Kernick. Like Paul Johnston's book it was impossible to put down and although I found the main character extremely annoying, I had to find out what happened next. By now I could see a clearly discernible pattern emerging in both thrillers, resembling a symphony in four movements:The hero is suddenly plunged into a nightmare scenario by an unexpected threat from an unknown individualThe hero tries to discover the source of the threat, but ends up being pursued by both the police and his enemyThe hero is at his lowest ebb and decides to fight back with the help of a trusted friendThe hero finally meets his adversary and they fight to the death. The hero wins.And that's it. It's a story that has been told for thousands of years and will probably continue to be. Both books were good fun but I'm now aching for a decent novel. I have a pile of books on my bedside table but at this moment in time I fancy re-reading Orwell's Keep the Aspidistra Flying."},
{"title": "Huzzah!", "date": "Wednesday, October 31, 2007", "text": "A few weeks ago I was given a copy of a history book about the Napoleonic wars called The War of Wars by Robert Harvey. Both the title and cover exuded an atmosphere of pipe smoke and testosterone and I could imagine retired colonels reading it with glee, revelling in the descriptions of canon fire and hand-to-hand fighting. War! 926 pages of it, to be precise.I put the book to one side, never really intending to read it, but something happened and one day I found myself reading the first chapter followed by the second, then the third until I realised I was hooked. I loved the author's sense of theatre. Napoleon is portrayed as a megalomaniac monster who makes Stalin seem quite moderate, whilst some of Britain's greatest military heroes come across as the vain, conceited, libidinous, flawed geniuses that they probably were. So many history books are dull - I should know, I was once a history undergraduate - so it was a great relief to come across a book by an author who knows how to entertain.I particularly enjoyed his claim that in his final years, Napoleon suffered from a rare disease that made him gradually change sex. According to Harvey, this rumour is confirmed by the former emperor's 'hysterical behaviour'! Right on, Bob.But beyond the theatrical narrative are some shocking statistics about the casualty rates of the many battles that took place, justifying Harvey's claim that the Napoleonic wars were a precursor for the First World War. I had no idea how many lives were lost and how the war effectively ended France's status as the major power in Europe(so it wasn't all bad). Particularly shocking was the description of the remnants of the French army struggling home after their failed invasion of Russia. In temperatures below -30, some soldiers cut their own fingers off to drink blood whilst others lay down in the snow to die, refusing any attempts to get them on their feet.I was also appalled by the behaviour of both the English and French soldiers, who on certain occasions thought nothing of robbing a community of its entire possessions and raping anything that moved. With many eyewitness accounts of atrocities, it is grimly fascinating to  read how war can brutalise ordinary men so quickly. The War of Wars may read like a gung-ho boys' book, but it doesn't gloss over any uncomfortable truths. The pointless waste of human life and energy denudes this era of its glamour and the overall impression is one of slaughter and destruction."},

{"title": "Why Proust hasn't changed my life", "date": "Sunday, October 21, 2007", "text": "One of the first lessons I learned when running the Fiction section was that the sales of the first volume of Proust's magnum opus A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu exceeded the rest of the series put together. Indeed, I'm not sure if I can remember selling any of the other volumes. Knowing that the first book had evidently bored the arse off so many people put a bit of a dampener on things and even Alain de Botton's glowing endorsement wasn't enough to change my mind. But the other day I was chatting to a colleague in the unpacking room and he told me that although there were moments that were interminably dull (he compared the last book to a Ronnie Corbett monolgue), he was glad that he'd made the effort. I was almost convinced.As a rule of thumb, the first volumes of novel sequences always sell at least twice as many copies as the remaining titles. The one exception to this is in the fantasy genre where, for better or worse, readers will happily buy every volume in the saga, particularly if the author's first name is Terry. It's very odd.I suppose we should be grateful that the first volume of Proust sells. There are plenty of classic novels that never leave the shop and would slowly go yellow with age if we didn't replace them with newer copies. For example, nobody buys The Scarlet Letter. It may be a classic novel but I haven't sold a copy for as long as I can remember. I always insist on stocking it because I strongly believe that our credibility as a bookseller would be undermined if we didn't, but it belongs in the subgenre of novels that nobody reads. Titles in this category would include:Cry the Beloved CountryThe Ragged-Trousered PhilanthropistBarnaby RudgeFranny and ZooeyThe Magic MountainMr Isherwood Changes TrainsThe Red and BlackThe MagusThe Bone PeopleThe Rachel PapersBurmese DaysThe LeopardThe Ordeal of Gilbert PinfoldSons and LoversRomolaRoom at the TopOne Day in the Life of Ivan DenisovitchLucky JimHowards End...The list goes on. Sometimes I try to rescue these books and promote them locally in the shop. Once I was even lucky enough to be able to spearhead a national campaign for 'Forgotten Classics' and although the results didn't quite hit the bestseller charts, I like to think that I was instrumental in introducing some people to Revolutionary Road, Life with a Star and Journey by Moonlight. However I'm under no illusions. As someone pointed out in an article a few weeks ago, the sales of a Booker-shortlisted novel are always easily exceeded by specialist publications like Anglers' Weekly. Literary fiction is, it would seem, the real minority interest."},

But what a life it would be, existing in a world without McDonalds, Big Brother, motorways, human resources, globalisation, mobile phones, Coldplay and CCTV. I wouldn't know that a devastating global conflict was only seven years away, so I could enjoy myself in blissful ignorance.However if I'd been born 100 years earlier I wouldn't have seen this wonderful photo, released by NASA recently:This amazing picture of Jupiter and its moon Io was taken earlier in the year by the New Horizons probe - a craft that was launched in January 2006 and is due to rendezvous with Pluto in 2015. What is so remarkable about the image, apart from its clarity and beauty, is the fact that a volcanic eruption is clearly visible on Io.If you ever start to feel depressed about Iraq, global warming, gun crime and dumbing down, visit NASA's superb website to see what Mankind is capable of.

To hear this astounding recording, click here.Whilst we're on the subject of space, another really exciting development  is the detection of planets outside our solar system. What was once a matter of conjecture is now a reality and in less than a couple of decades we have discovered nearly 250 planets.

I was bedridden  for a week, my wife and children were staying at my mother-in-law's  and the boredom and isolation (along with broadband access next to my bed) resulted in my first blog entry.I expected my random musings to disappear into the ether. Blogging would be a solitary, cathartic activity - the 21st century equivalent of a journal - but to my surprise people started to post comments. My vanity was flattered by the knowledge that others had read my words and considered them worth responding to, but more importantly I enjoyed finding myself in a community of witty, intelligent, incisive people whose comments augmented my half-baked ideas with real wisdom. I was hooked.What should I write about? I was a bookseller and knew that this was the part of my life that would be of more interest to others than anything else, but Ottakar's had just been taken over by Waterstone's and I was accutely aware that my new employer had sacked someone over the coments of their blog. I was left with my personal life - dull, unless you can reinvent it with the wit of Stephen Fry - and a fairly random selection of subjects that arouse strong feelings in me. I opted for the latter.11,550 hits later I have to confess that I have run out of things to say. I can't tell you the really juicy things about bookselling because I have a mortgage to pay. Also as far as Waterstones goes, it falls a long way short of the 'Evil Empire' status that some have attributed to it. It is a big company run by retailers and there are frustrations associated with that, but boringly for blog readers there are lots of good people in the company and overall they're trying to do the right thing.Perhaps I should write a whimsical account of being a father in the 21st century, as that's all I do in my spare time. However when I read self-consciously witty articles by sensitive 'new men' about parenthood (written in a nauseatingly intimate style that is obviously designed to court female readers) I feel nothing but contempt.That leaves my interests: books, music, philosophy, environmental issues etc. I've written about a few subjcets but many of the subjects I'm most passionate about would bore the arse off most people. Do you want to read my thoughts abouts Sibelius? No. Do you care what I think about Gordon Brown? Of course not. So what is there left to blog about?I think it is time to leave the blogosphere; not in a permanent 'never again' dramatic exit, but simply as an acknowledgement that it is pointless to blog for the sake of it.I have been accutely aware of the need to add content at least once a week and have recently found this increasingly difficult. I can't quite bring myself to abandon the pretentiously titled Age of Uncertainty but unless I suddenly have a lot to say, I shall keep my counsel.As David Soul sang, 'Don't Give Up on Me Baby'. I will still blog, but I will try to deliver quality rather than quantity. Less is more."},

The bottom theme continues in the garden...The gardens are almost as spectacular as the house. Even the butterflies are more colourful than normal...And everywhere you look, there are statues, busts and beautiful ceramics.The most remarkable thing about Charleston is that even though it's only a five-bedroom Sussex farmhouse, every square inch has been altered by its occupants, right down to the fabric design of the chairs and the bedroom rugs.

{"title": "The best things in life...", "date": "Friday, September 07, 2007", "text": "Although gambling and bad investments are one of the most conspicuous ways of losing money, if you want to be seriously out of pocket you can't beat having children. Goodbye eating out and foreign holidays. Parents often complain about the cost of school clothing and equipment, but in my experience the biggest drain on finances is the day out.It always seems like a good idea to take the family to a local castle, zoo, aquarium or science park until you get to the admission gate. Then the horrible truth sets in - we cannot afford to go in. We always do buy the tickets, but the knowledge that I have just blown over half a day's wages does tend to nag in the back of my mind, particularly when my oldest son seems bored after 30 minutes.This year I decided to spend more time visiting places that didn't cost a penny. We are very lucky to be living in the middle of the South Downs with a beach less than 8 miles away, so it should be easy enough to keep my children happy without spending a fortune. But would today's media-savvy, product-consuming children accept the simple pleasures of nature?The answer was a resounding yes.Last week I took my oldest soon and his best friend to a local beach and they were perfectly happy exploring the rock pools at low tide and climbing the ledges at the bottom of the cliffs. If you look carefully, you just about see them.The cliffs are amazing, particularly when you think that they are comprised of the remains of billions of aquatic creatures spanning several geological eras. I find it all slightly mind-blowing. But to return to the point, apart from spending three pounds on ice creams the day was completely free and the boys loved it.I'm not surprised. My happiest childhood memories all revolved around simple pleasures: damming-up a stream, fishing in a river, building a den and exploring rock pools. Children need an environment that allows them to use their imagination and discover things for themselves without being spoon-fed information or told that they are violating rules.People often moan that today's children are spoiled and have too much. They also complain that we have become too child-centered and children no longer respect adults in the way that previous generations did. But that is only part of the picture. I can't help feeling that in today's child-friendly society, many kids are worse off than they would have been 50 years ago.Today most of us don't hit our children and they have more toys than we ever did, but are they any happier for it? I'm concerned that the things that really make children happy: exploring the outside world, playing in the street with other kids, climbing trees etc are being denied to the current generation in the name of safety. In some cases this is because of a legitimate fear of traffic and a paranoia about strangers. In others - inner-city London or Manchester for example - this is because the urban environment doesn't provide spaces for children to be children (is it any wonder that gang culture is rife in these areas?).If I was a dictator, I would ensure that no child had to grow-up in a high-rise flat and also make sure that everyone was within a five-minute walk of a park. I would limit schools to a maximum of 500 pupils, bring back cottage hospitals and introduce no-car zones where kids could play in the street. In other words, improve people's environments and restore a sense of community to the poorer parts of our cities.And if that didn't work,  then I'd send them all to the Isle of  Man."},

It is a book, obviously, but a very special book.  It is a lost classic.  It is a masterpiece of modern literature.  It is a telling parable of racial and sexual tolerance.  It is a book that should be on every self-respecting shelf in the land.  It is also the first book I have ever published.  Yep, after nearly a year in the job a Friday Project book has come off the press that was signed and acquired by little old me.  And I doubt that any book I ever publish will make me prouder (or is that more proud?, I neither know nor care).  You see, Gents was first published ten years ago by Marion Boyars.  It received widespread critical acclaim, and sold OK, but has since slipped beneath the radar and you will be hard pressed to find a copy in your local bookshop or library.  That isn't just a shame, it is a travesty.  Gents is a remarkable piece of work and everyone I have foisted it upon has said the same thing: 'why haven't I heard of this before?'  Gents is quite possibly the best book you have never read. Unless, of course, you have, in which case I salute your good taste.With a recommendation like this how could I resist, particularly when Scott was generously offering free copies. I emailed my request and when I returned home from work the next day, a copy was already on the doormat.That evening I started reading Gents and within a few pages I was completely hooked. Set in a public lavatory, Gents depicts the attempts of its three attendants to control the rampant cottaging that takes place in the cubicles. That sounds like a recipe for an essay in grim, social realism, but it is a tribute to Collins' genius that he manages to create a novel that is both moving and funny.As if that isn't a big enough achievement in itself, Collins' three main characters are Jamaican and a lot of the dialogue is in patois which, this grainy photo would suggest, isn't Collins' native tongue. That sounds like a recipe for disaster, but apparently Collins did it so well that many Afro-Caribbean readers assumed that he was a black writer.It takes enough talent to set a novel in the claustrophobic setting of a public lavatory, but to give yourself the challenge of having three main characters from a different ethnic background and attempt to write their dialogue without stereotyping or patronising is nigh-on impossible.

The seasoned book buyer knows what this means and leaves with a philosophical shrug of the shoulders, but many people seem to have problems understanding the full meaning of the term out of print.Some seem to think that it only applies to my shop and say 'Oh, I'll try Smith's then.'Others believe that although the book is unavailable, I am able to make an exception for them because they are special.Then there is a third category of people, most of whom are quite old, who believe that literary merit will secure a book a permanent place on the bookshelves. When I have told them that a book by their favourite author is no longer in print (today it was a book by Dirk Bogarde) I am met by incredulity and, sometimes, anger, as if I am personally insulting their literary tastes.Sometimes I get 'But it can't be out of print. It's quite new.' And to be fair, the customers have a point. It's not unreasonable to assume that a book published in 1998 or even 2003 will still be available, but sadly many books never survive beyond their initial print run in paperback. On the few occasions I've told customers about market forces and printing costs, I have felt like a grown-up telling a child that there's no Father Christmas.That's my bookseller's perspective. As a reader I'm completely on the side of the customers, as I never cease to be appalled by how many wonderful books are allowed to fade into obscurity. I don't blame the publishers. They're not philanthropic societies and if they allowed too many lame ducks a second print run they'd be wasting capital that could have been spent on new titles. However it can be depressing to see market forces in action.Today I read a review of a new biography of Bernard Malamud and remembered a wonderful novel by him called A New Life. It is the sort of book that would appeal to anyone who likes Richard Yates' Revolutionary Road and I decided to order some for our Staff Favourites bay. I looked up the ISBN only to discover that it's out of print.If an author of Malamud's stature is allowed to drop out of circulation then it doesn't bode well for lesser authors. However the beauty of blogging is that the publishing world is becoming more democratic, as readers are now empowered to canvass in support of their favourite books. A recommendation from Dovegreyreader, John Self or Scott Pack is all it takes to get that essential word-of-mouth ball rolling and save a book from languishing in undeserved obscurity."},
{"title": "Diana", "date": "Friday, August 31, 2007", "text": "I was lying in bed on a sunny Sunday morning when I heard the Sunday Times land with a thud on the doormat of my flat in southwest London. On the front page there was a small feature which had obviously been inserted at the last minute, reporting that Princess Diana had been seriously injured in a car accident. I thought about her sons and how worried they would be, then got on with reading the rest of the paper.An hour or so later I turned on the television and heard the news. Once again I thought about her sons and, shamefully, also tried to work out how I could get hold of the Andrew Morton book before any other bookshop beat me to it. Then I got dressed and prepared for my wife's grandmother's 90th birthday party.I distinctly remember the mood of the people at the party. They were slightly shocked by the news of Diana's death, but regarded it with a sense of detachment and the conversation swiftly moved on to other subjects. That seemed a normal response. I felt sad that her life had ended in such a pointless way but didn't feel a Diana-shaped hole in my life. Any sadness I felt was for the two young princes, who had lost a very loving mother.When I watched the television that evening a saw the bouquets of flowers and Tony Blair's faintly nauseating 'People's Princess' speech, I felt as if I was an Invasion of the Body Snatchers scenario in which almost everyone else seemed to belong to some sort of movement that had passed me by. Who were these people who travelled miles (some hundreds) to weep and place a thirty quid bunch of flowers in a huge pile? What did Diana mean to them? Why did I feel relatively indifferent?Perhaps it was because so many people empathised with Diana. Although she was a member of the aristocracy she had the 'common touch' and always seemed an outsider in the Royal Family. But that's only part of the answer - people never took Fergie to their hearts (and I'm sure it's more than a ginger hair issue). Diana had charisma, part of which was her vulnerability, that cut through the social niceties and made people feel that they had a special rapport with her. If you want to be an icon, be vulnerable. It worked for Marilyn Monroe.Ten years on the Diana industry shows no sign of abating. Like Monroe she will always be young and beautiful, albeit with a dodgy 80s hairstyle.Prince Harry's speech at today's memorial service was a masterpiece of diplomacy. He paid a glowing tribute to his mother but also subtly implied that the deification of Diana was quite wrong. He also loyally asserted his love for his father, who has been vilified by the Diana movement.  The boy will go far."},

Grow up.I have a cousin who is 60 and for years she has pretended to be disabled. She has a walking frame which has been accessorised with minature teddy bears and she takes it almost everywhere with her.

{"title": "You can judge a book by its cover", "date": "Sunday, August 19, 2007", "text": "The other day I was stock-checking the Fiction section when I noticed that we only had four novels by Anita Shreve, all of them spine-on. Three years ago she was the bestselling author of mid-market women's fiction and would have enjoyed at least a whole shelf to herself with every title face-out, but her sales have dramatically declined. Why?One half of the answer was three bays to my left: Jodi Picoult. Her sales have risen as dramatically as Shreve's have fallen and she is an essential addition to any 3 for 2 promotion. However I think there is also another reason. Several years ago when Shreve topped the bestseller lists, the British arm of TimeWarner decided to change the covers, or as they would put it, refresh the jacket treatment.They decided to change this:For this:Which looks remarkably similar to Jodi Picoult's covers...And is if by magic, the sales started to drop off. Perhaps they would have done anyway, but I can't help wondering what would have happened if TimeWarner have done nothing. I can see the publisher's logic - they didn't want one of their best authors to have jackets that looked dated. However, those jackets were part of the successful Shreve 'brand'. The same thing happened with Freya North, whose books sold like hotcakes until some bright spark at Hodder decided to try and make their mark (if I was her I would have sued for loss of earnings). If it ain't broke, don't fix it.It's interesting noting how publishers slavishly copy each other when one of them has a hit. In the early 90s, the success of Joanna Trollope spawned a wave of imitation aga sagas and tasteful, slightly insipid covers with watercolour paintings were de rigeur for a few years. Then Bridget Jones appeared and spawned the Chick Lit revolution with jackets that were curiously very similar to each other, but not to Bridget Jones.At the moment most sub-genres have fairly predictable jackets, but that isn't a criticism - in a section with thousands of different titles, book covers are vital signifiers. If you want a Napoleonic Wars naval adventure or a post-Gladiator swords and togas romp, you'll be able to spot the books pretty quickly. And it's also amusing how a Da Vinci Code brand emerged so quickly for the dozens of historical-conspiracy-thriller novels that suddenly popped up in the wake of Dan Brown's success.Here's one of my favourite examples of copycat publishing:The lovely Martina Cole (and I'm not saying that in a sneering, ironic way - she really is lovely) has many imitators including the annoyingly-named Mandasue Heller...And arch-miserablist Kevin Lewis...I'm a self-confessed book jacket anorak, but in mitigation I plead over-exposure to books."},
{"title": "'Spiritual'", "date": "Tuesday, August 14, 2007", "text": "My laptop is going for a slow, operatic death. Like the consumptive Mimi, you know its days are numbered but it can still belt out the odd aria. I've ordered a new laptop from Germany and in my crude, racial stereotyping sort of way, I expect it to arrive punctually and be in full working order.In the meantime, here's a bit of lazy blogging. However I hope you'll forgive the cut and paste once you've read the following by Guardian TV reviewer Charlie Brooker:In the 18th century, a revolution in thought, known as the Enlightenment, dragged us away from the superstition and brutality of the Middle Ages toward a modern age of science, reason and democracy. It changed everything. If it wasn't for the Enlightenment, you wouldn't be reading this right now. You'd be standing in a smock throwing turnips at a witch. Yes, the Enlightenment was one of the most significant developments since the wheel. Which is why we're trying to bollocks it all up. Welcome to a dangerous new era - the Unlightenment - in which centuries of rational thought are overturned by idiots. Superstitious idiots. They're everywhere - reading horoscopes, buying homeopathic remedies, consulting psychics, babbling about \"chakras\" and \"healing energies\", praying to imaginary gods, and rejecting science in favour of soft-headed bunkum. But instead of slapping these people round the face till they behave like adults, we encourage them. We've got to respect their beliefs, apparently. Well I don't. \"Spirituality\" is what cretins have in place of imagination. If you've ever described yourself as \"quite spiritual\", do civilisation a favour and punch yourself in the throat until you're incapable of speaking aloud ever again. Why should your outmoded codswallop be treated with anything other than the contemptuous mockery it deserves? Maybe you've put your faith in spiritual claptrap because our random, narrative-free universe terrifies you. But that's no solution. If you want comforting, suck your thumb. Buy a pillow. Don't make up a load of floaty blah about energy or destiny. This is the real world, stupid. We should be solving problems, not sticking our fingers in our ears and singing about fairies. Everywhere you look, screaming gittery is taking root, with serious consequences. The NHS recently spent £10m refurbishing the London Homeopathic Hospital. The equivalent of 500 nurses' wages, blown on a handful of magic beans. That was your tax money. It was meant for saving lives. Inevitably, the world of science and logic is slowly fighting back. Hence the recent slew of anti-God books, one of which, The God Delusion, was written by Richard Dawkins, writer-presenter of The Enemies Of Reason (Mon, 8pm, C4). Dawkins has softened his style somewhat since his previous series, The Root of All Evil, in which he toured the globe interviewing religious extremists. Trouble was, their views made him so uppity, he occasionally came off worst. They remained eerily calm, while he huffed furiously. And because he looks and sounds precisely like Professor Yaffle from Bagpuss, the end effect was often unintentional hilarity.In The Enemies of Reason he's still angry - how couldn't he be? - but this time round Dawkins controls his temper, focusing it like a laser beam, taking on spirituality and superstition in all its forms. The overall tone is less hectoring, more persuasive, and occasionally outright playful. It's more likely to win people over. The end result is possibly the most important broadcast of the year so far; important because it presents a passionate argument we really all ought to be having right now, if we want to prevent a great slide backwards into mud-eating barbarism. And if you think that's hyperbole, I suggest you pick up a newspaper and see how many of the world's problems are currently being caused or exacerbated by the rejection of rational thought. From fundamentalist death cults to arrogant invasions: a startling lack of logic unites them all. Cold, clear, rational thought is the most important thing we have; the one thing that can save us. If I was made Emperor of All Media, I'd broadcast something akin to The Enemies Of Reason on every channel, every day, for 10 years. This is an urgent message that must be heard if we want to survive, as a species. Oh. And I'd also broadcast a load of Tex Avery cartoons, just to show off my lighter side. Man, I loves dat Droopy."},

{"title": "Closing down", "date": "Monday, August 06, 2007", "text": "In the seaside town where I work I've lost count of how many shops have closed this year, the victims of poor sales and high rents. The latest is a secondhand bookshop which had a wonderfully eclectic selection of books. However, the closing down sale wasn't their finest hour...A print of an owl for £10? But worse still was the awful 'original' oil painting of Chinese junks - yours for a mere fifty quid. Perhaps they're better at selling books than paintings.I used to walk past the shop at closing time and wonder how they could afford to have so many staff. I now have my answer: they couldn't. It's a great shame as we need cavernous, fusty old bookshops that smell of damp and crawl with booklice, because amongst the many out of date travel guides and memoirs by people we no longer care about there are hidden gems. Browsing in any bookshop is a delight, but I particularly love the antiquarian ones.I know the book trade well enough to have a fairly clear idea of what the average Waterstone's, Borders and WH Smith's will have in stock. But when you walk into an independently-run shop that specialises in secondhand books, there's always the possibility that you may find a book that will change your life.One of my best serendipitous moments in bookselling was when I started unpacking a box and came across Sven Lindqvist's Desert Divers - a slim volume that I probably wouldn't have noticed in the travel writing section. I read the book and was so captivated by it that I felt compelled to explore further and three months later, found myself sitting in the Cafe Pierre Loti in Istanbul as a direct result of opening a cardboard on a dull day in February.At the moment retail is all about consolidation and homogenisation, but there is a quiet revolution going on. People are waking up to the fact that everywhere is beginning to look the same and are trying to reassert their local identity. In the 1990s I remember travelling to Wales for a stag weekend. Our van broke down and we found ourselves in an unfamiliar town. I wandered through a shopping precinct and tried to work out where we were, but all I could see was Dixons, Woolworths, Superdrug, WH Smith, Boots etc... In the end I had to walk up to someone and ask them 'Where am I?' (The answer was Leatherhead). That can't be right (and it's nowhere near Wales)."},
{"title": "Post Modern", "date": "Sunday, August 05, 2007", "text": "When did it stop becoming socially acceptable to make racist comments?  When I was in my teens I remember cringing with shame and embarrassment at some of the remarks made by people of the older generation. A great-aunt married a particularly offensive man who liked to talk about Yids, Coons and Pakis and I remember assuming that his vitriolic views were a product of his personality. But even my dear father used to complain about the coloureds. I had several friends who weren't white, so I took it personally.Then, suddenly, it all seemed to stop.The racism didn't go away, but a lot of people realised that they could no longer assume that other white people would share their views. The jokes stopped.But then the pendulum swung in the other direction. Political correctness appeared and soon, every children's programme seemed to have a quota of black faces, even when it was set in a Scottish fishing village. This could have been a good thing, but the reality was that racism hadn't disappeared. People had just stopped talking about an uncomfortable subject.Historians in the future could be forgiven for assuming that we live in an era a racial harmony, if they watch programmes like Balamory. The reality is quite different, as anyone who lives in the poorer parts of London knows and the number of young black men who have been shot, stabbed or injured this year is a statistic that many would rather ignore. Sweep it under the carpet.Which is why I say hats off to Doctor Who! You may wonder what's behind this tangential leap, but the fact is that Doctor Who is one of the only recent British drama series to have openly acknowledged the thorny issue of racism. In the two stories which involved travelling into the past, the Doctor's assistant Martha Jones has to put up with bigoted, racist comments. In Shakespeare's London she is called a Blackamoor, whilst her claim to be a doctor in 1913 is refuted with the comment 'I hardly think that someone of your sex and colour could be a trained physician'.It's to their credit that the scriptwriters of Doctor Who have acknowledged that a black woman with a strong London accent is going to meet with adversity and the result has been some of the best drama I've seen for a long time. Not talking about racial problems reminds me of the people who used to say that class was no longer an issue. If a primetime family drama like Doctor Who is prepared to tackle uncomfortable issues then perhaps there's hope for all of the other television dramas that reduce people to quotas and cliches."},

In those days most people had never heard of him and although he was a voice from an earlier generation, we claimed him as one of our our. We lazed on lawns, smoking, staring at the sky, listening to the Thoughts of Mary Jane. I could never understand why such a great songwriter remained an obscure word-of-mouth artist, but fortunately Drake has been belatedly acknowledged as a genius and now has an international following that includes Brad Pitt and, more importantly, Goncalo Veiga.I thought I'd heard everything by Nick Drake, but last month a new album was released called Family Tree. There are 28 tracks, most of which are original songs by Drake, however there are also a couple of songs written and sung by his mother and two duets with his sister Gabrielle.  These recordings were all made before Nick Drake secured a recording contract and the quality is pretty poor, but that's part of the album's charm. Family Tree sounds amateurish but in the best possible way, giving us a privileged insight into an incredibly talented artist and his family.In her sleeve notes Gabrielle Drake acknowledges that her brother probably wouldn't have wanted to let these recordings see the light of day, but unfortunately there are so many bootleg versions - the result of Drake's parents generosity towards fans who asked for copies of their tapes - that a commercial recording was inevitable. Family Tree may be scraping the bottom of the barrel but oh, what a barrel."},

Today I took my son to Alfriston, where we followed the River Cuckmere down to the sea and during the whole walk we saw fewer than ten people. Here's the evidence:Why aren't other people enjoying this beautiful landscape? I find it completely baffling, but I'm not complaining because the absence of humans means that you get to see more creatures. Today's highlight was a heron, slowly flapping its wings and gliding like a pterodactyl, oblivious to our presence. I'm not particularly interested in birds and Bill Oddie's Naturewatch bores the arse off me, but there's nothing like seeing something for yourself.And it's not just about seeing but also hearing: grasshoppers, dragonflies, skylarks and the wonderful woosh of the wind in the reeds. God I sound like a boring old fart. I might as well start sewing on the leather elbow patches. However today was a reminder that for me at least, that elusive thing called happiness needn't cost a penny.We finished where we began, in Alfriston. It is one of those picture postcard villages that seems perfect to the point of being slightly sinister. As we walked through the churchyard we saw children playing cricket on the village green, whilst in the distance an old man was pruning the roses around his cottage. I suspect that these people are actually Eastern Europeans, paid to put on a show for the coachloads of elderly tourists who want to be assured that ye olde England still exists. In the evening they probably catch the bus back to their sink estates and crack dens. On the other hand, maybe Alfriston is as good as it seems:The only downside is the traffic that thunders through it most of the time. Admittedly there aren't many cars in this photo, but that is because I would have been run over if there were. If you visit Alfriston, make sure you visit the award-winning independent bookshop Much Ado Books. They opened relatively recently and show that there's still room for new independent booksellers if they are imaginative and passionate about what they do (I also suspect that they weren't short of a few quid).

Perhaps I wouldn't have bothered, but the film was introduced by a film critic was baldly stated that the film was a masterpiece.I recently wrote that I only owned a few DVDs and hadn't watched any more than twice, but I have seen this film at least five times and love it more each time I see it."},

If it had been Bergman and Tarkovsky I would have assumed that their books must have been somewhere else, but the selection I saw convinced me that the owner's cultural experiences were probably limited to Hollywood blockbusters. I wondered how many times anyone would want to watch Terminator 2, enjoyable as it was. I could never understand the Yours to own adverts, which tried to entice buyers with special features. In the case of Star Trek VIII: First Contact, the special feature was an interview with Alice Krige who plays the Borg queen. Sorry. Alice who?There are very few films that I'd want to own and I've probably only watched the few that I have once or twice at the most. On the other hand, there are hundreds of movies that I want to watch, so Amazon's DVD rental service is a Godsend. During the last couple of years I've been able to catch up with all of the cheesy blockbusters I've never seen, like Airport, explore the burgeoning world of Korean cinema, see some of the best of contemporary European cinema, veg out in front of trashy horror flicks like The Devil's Rejects and revisit classics like the wonderful The Killing of Sister George.Just to give you an example, here are ten films I really enjoyed but wouldn't have bought:The Czech DreamMy Summer of LoveLantanaSoylent GreenCrashThe EdukatorsOld BoyDirty HarryCapturing the Friedmansand one of the most remarkable movies I've ever seen...I've read that it's the only film in the Inuit language and it's unlike anything I've ever seen.

You can now read Moby Dick without the endless digressions about the whaling industry, or Les Miserables without the tedious preambles. The result: more people reading the classics. Possibly.Personally I love Moby Dick and even the lengthy dissertations on sailing and whaling have a mesmerising poetry about them. As for Victor Hugo, he does go on a bit, but I wouldn't have missed a single word. However I didn't get hot under the collar about the Compact Classics until I saw an abridged edition of Vanity Fair.Vanity Fair!There are no boring bits in Vanity Fair. It is one of the funniest, wittiest and most enjoyable books in the English language and to remove any text from the original would be like pouring half of a bottle of champagne down the sink. It is bad enough that many editions do not include Thackeray's original illustrations.The drawings are not a superfluous addition to the text but are an integral part of the novel, often augmenting the narrative. For example when we read that a so-and-so was hard at work, it is essential that this line is accompanied by an illustration showing a man lounging in a chair with his feet up on the table.Compact Classics are the fast forward button of literature. I don't think that they are the answer to getting more people reading classics. Surely the trick lies in persuading people that once they read the first few chapters, they will become so engrossed in the plot that they'll stop being aware of the florid prose style.So far we haven't sold any of our Compact Classics and with any luck, they'll die a death. In the meantime I shall be displaying the full version of the wonderful Vanity Fair at the front of the shop."},

I'm not complaining. I've always wondered what a nervous breakdown would be like and another day like yesterday would have provided me with the answer. As things stand, we sold a thousand books, kept our nerve and most of the customers were perfectly happy. I need to keep telling myself that rather than obsessing about the handful of unpleasant people (none of them regular bookshop customers) who decided to make a scene because we'd run out of the children's edition for three hours.One woman in her 40s said that she felt like crying. I reminded her that we still had the book and whilst she might not like the front cover as much, it was the same story and if she couldn't wait, we'd swap it up for a kids edition in a few days. She wasn't having any of it. Naturally I would have liked to express my complete contempt for her and point out that whilst she was winging about the jacket of a children's book, thousands of people had lost their homes in floods. But I didn't, as I have to maintain a facade of professionalism.I read the newspaper and searched the internet for tales of Potter madness, but all I could find were unbelievably upbeat statements by bookshop managers who are clearly thinking of their next promotion. You know what I mean: 'It was a great evening and we all got really excited...' rather than 'It was the most stressful day of my life. The whole thing veered dangerously close to disaster and a gang of drunken chavs were shouting abuse at the queue...' I can't stand that cult of positivity in businesses where people feel they always have to be upbeat about everything, otherwise they're not a team player. It invalidates the genuinely positive comments.I had a crisis of confidence. Perhaps my Potter event was the only one that was tricky. Maybe I hadn't planned it properly and everyone else breezed through the launch, but a few phone calls confirmed that I wasn't alone. One manager, who is possibly the most organised and effective person I have met, said that she felt out of control and cried when her staff weren't looking. The general consensus was that it was the most challenging experience of our careers but the important thing is, we triumphed over adversity and almost everyone got their books.If I was rich, I'd board my private jet and fly off to my Swiss clinic, but if I had that sort of money I probably wouldn't be working in a bookshop (much as I love it!). Instead I have a choice between watching Dunkirk, with John Mills and David Attenborough, or an episode from Season One of Starsky and Hutch. Maybe I'll watch both.In the meantime, my internet searches did reveal this amusing posting on the web site of Night Shade Books: Ann and I went down to the local B&N to witness the Harry Potter madness. The mall parking lot was packed. The kids and adults had destroyed the magazine and children's sections. There was no way we could get a book.So, instead, we waited outside. A kid came out, probably all of nine years old. A little girl with braces. As per our pre-arranged plan, Ann distracted her with some glitter and a pinwheel. Then I snatched the book out of the girl's hands and ran for it while Ann hightailed it back to the car. The girl was screaming her head off, but luckily, there were so many people around I lost myself in the crowd. Ann then drove round to pick me up. I was hiding where we'd planned for me to.It all went off without a hitch. Another successful midnight Potter party for us."},

I had customers shouting at me, another phoned to tell me how stressful they found our Potter party and to top it all, we ran out of the children's edition.This afternoon I ended up having to drive 40 miles to a warehouse to pick up more stock for tomorrow, as there won't be any more deliveries until Monday.Who is to blame? I think the answer is quite clear: Bloomsbury. By enforcing a cap on returning unsold copies they have put booksellers in an impossible position where we have to take all of the risks. When you're selling a book at near the cost price, you can't afford to sit on too much unreturnable stock. It will be interesting to see whether the trade press come to similar conclusions.I have had three hours sleep and I've still got another day to go. I hope we'll have enough books to get us through tomorrow.I've just returned from our midnight launch of the final Harry Potter novel. I should go to sleep as I'm due to be back in the shop in five hours time, but my brain is buzzing after what was possibly the most stressful two hours of my bookselling career.Our launch for the last book was great fun. Most of the customers turned up in fancy dress and there was a really good atmosphere which reached its climax when, at midnight, we plunged the shop into darkness and our brightly-lit glass lift descended, packed to the brim with Potter books. As the customers left, many thanked us for a wonderful evening.This time we decided to repeat our successful formula. We'd added a security guard and another member of staff as we were expecting the evening to be a little busier, but we weren't unnecessarily worried. The customer reservations were all sorted and I'd double-checked all of the silly little things that can bring a shop to a standstill: bags, money, till rolls, bar codes etc. What could go wrong?Just before 11.00 we opened the doors and people started to pour into the shop. The shop filled up quickly and I was expecting the queue to die down, but like Rorke's Drift, they kept on coming. Soon, the whole shop was a crush of bodies and the air became stiflingly hot. We started our activities but people could barely hear us, even when I used the tannoy. My role was to check that everyone was okay and deal with any problems, but it was becoming increasingly difficult to squeeze through the crowds.At midnight we repeated the countdown and switched off the lights, but hardly anyone noticed the lift coming down and I was really worried that there would be a mad scramble for the books, with people pushing each other out of the way. Luckily, we'd circumvented that by giving tickets to people with reservations which they could swap for a pre-bagged copy of their book. If we hadn't done that, we would have had several hundred people queuing at our till point.I suppose the important thing is that nothing did go wrong. We had planned the evening carefully down to the last detail and although nothing could have prepared us for the huge turnout - way beyond anything I've seen before - we got through it. I just wish that it had been more enjoyable. Hardly anyone dressed up and people seemed to be grumpier. I think many of the customers just wanted to get the book and get out, but because there were so many of them they had to queue.What could we have done differently? It would have been nice to have made the midnight launch a ticketed event, limited to 150. But we couldn't have turned away customers, particularly when there are other shops selling the book.WH Smiths were pathetic. They tried to poach people from our queue with an offer to buy the book for £2 less than us, but didn't mention that customers would only qualify if they spent £15 on stationery. As for the other shops, I never saw them because I was running around like a madman, trying to keep HMS Waterstone's afloat.I wonder what today will be like?"},

I drove up to Teddington to visit my mother and visited the local cemetery, where my grandparents and father are buried. After pulling up some weeds which may have contained atoms of my grandparents, I started walking back and suddenly found myself lying on the ground, feeling like Superman when he's exposed to Kryptonite. After a  few minutes I got up and staggered home.I assumed that I'd had a blood sugar crisis and didn't think anything of it, but my hypochondriac mother is concerned that I've had a minor heart attack. I would have dismissed the idea out of hand, as I'm neither old nor fat, but every time I've picked up the local paper recently it's had a story about a much-loved father of two young children who suddenly collapsed and died of coronary failure. Yikes! The Death Clock may be right after all.I spent yesterday in bed and on the plus side, read a wonderful novel by Sylvie Germain called Infinite Possibilities. If I'm going to die, this a fine book to finish with. It reminded me a little of George Gissing's semi-autobiographical Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft in that it was all about someone's whose world had been reduced to a microcosm, but they had kept their sanity by imbuing every tiny detail with meaning. Ultimately the novel is a celebration of the human spirit and the infinite possibilities of the imagination. It is no surprise that the author is a philosopher.As for my imminent mortality, I am seeing a doctor tomorrow just to put my mind at rest. I cannot die before Friday, as we're launching the new Harry Potter at midnight. There has been a lot of negative comment in the trade press about Bloomsbury and J.K.Rowling and some of it is deserved, but it is impossible to be cynical when you're surrounded by 200 people in silly costumes chanting 'We want Harry! We want Harry!' I know that some booksellers are concerned that Friday is going to be completely out of control, but I think that if we just relax and have enjoy the madness it's going to be a great evening.I won't be reading the new Harry Potter. After the third book they became far too long and life's too short, particularly in my case. Bugger Hogwarts. From now on it's Sylvie Germain for me."},

I expected them to slow down when they reached the dangerously vertiginous Keere Street but like George III, they raced each other to the bottom. I envied them and regretted the fact that I was now supposed to be a sensible person.As the boys reached the bottom of the hill I saw an old lady glaring disapprovingly at them and thought about how many older people hate and fear the young. Is it jealousy because the young have their whole lives ahead of them, or do the old simply forget what it's like to be young?I found a wonderful quote the other day: 'Children no longer respect their elders and everyone seems to be writing a book.'  It was a perfect summary of today's curmudgeonly viewpoint, but looking at the next line I noticed that the quotation came from Cicero in AD43!I am still young enough to remember how badly some older people treated me. When I started in bookselling I was patronised, shouted at and treated as if I was a lesser species. People in their sixties would chastise me because I hadn't heard of an obscure out of print author who was briefly big in the 50s. One woman called a colleague of mine a 'silly bitch', another shouted at my wife because we didn't have Flecker's Hassan. 'You know nothing you silly girl!' My wife politely replied that she had a degree. 'In what? came the scornful reply, 'Shoelaces?'Teenagers are a popular target in the media. We condemn their behaviour as if it has appeared out of the blue, but the reason why things are so screwed-up is more down to the self-centred behaviour of the baby-boomer Me generation."},

At least that's what I was expecting, but in fact the children were completely different from last week's selection. Nobody shuffled their chairs, everyone was well behaved and after the event, we sold quite a few books. Why were the schools so different? School no.2 wasn't particularly middle-class, but there seemed to be fewer boys with strange haircuts and earrings.Yesterday' s author was Linda Buckley-Archer, whose tales of 21st century kids accidentally finding themselves in the 18th century not only gripped thousands of young readers but also had my children's bookseller wide-eyed with enthusiasm. Until last week I hadn't done a school event for several years and I'd forgotten how rewarding they were. It's great seeing a hundred children getting genuinely excited about a book. I wish that I could take every old person who complains that children are only interested in television and computer games and show them how wrong they are.Linda Buckley-Archer was great and handled 120 children as if she'd been doing it for years. Later on I discovered that she had.After the event we talked about the questions that children ask. No matter which school the author visited, they were remarkably consistent:How much money have you got?What car do you drive?When did you decide to become an author?Have you ever been on telly?After the event, the author signed copies and we handed out free bookmarks. In today's consumer society it was amazing to see how much excitement a simple bookmark generated. What a refreshing change to the increasing number of people who, to quote Oscar Wild, know the price of everything and the value of nothing."},
{"title": "Momento Mori", "date": "Tuesday, July 03, 2007", "text": "I recently discovered a website called The Death Clock. It's based on a horrible but tantalising premise: if you enter your date of birth, height, weight and personal vices, the clock will tell you when you're going to die. I dutifully entered my details, expecting some date after 2040 and clicked the calculate button.According to the Death Clock, I will die in eight years time!What's going on? I'm not due to retire for another 22 years, gave up smoking when I was 27 and although I eat and drink more than I should, I'm in pretty good shape. However, it's all in vain because I'm doomed. It's not fair. George Melly and John Mortimer are still tarting their way around London's literary demi monde despite their appalling physical state, so why has the Death Clock decided to cull someone who was born four decades later?How should I spend my last eight years? Should I maintain a quiet dignity, working until the last minute, or should I become self-indulgent and totally debauched, raging against the dying of the light?My personal preference is the Jack Hawkins approach: a slight twitch of the upper lip and the understated confession that 'It's a bit of a bad show' followed by complete stoicism. No hysteria please - that's for Johnny Foreigner. If I could replace today's male role models - gangsta rappers, David Beckham, Justin Timberlake and Pete Doherty - with Jack Hawkins, we'd all be better off.Luckily, for me at least, it appears that the Death Clock is fallible. I have discovered a Canadian website run by doctors which has a slightly more sophisticated approach to weighing one's mortality. I have gained another 40 years which still isn't enough, but apparently if I drink less and exercise more, I get bonus points.But perhaps the Death Clock's criteria are more sophisticated than personal health. Supposing it has also entered Anglo-American foreign policy, global warming and religious fundamentalism into the equation? I missed last week's Piccadilly bomb by a few hours.I don't really believe that I only have eight years to live and I think that the Death Clock is just a piece of random internet fun. However it has made me think twice about certain aspects of my lifestyle.  View it at your peril."},
{"title": "William Nicholson", "date": "Friday, June 29, 2007", "text": "Today I went with my wonderful children's bookseller to sell some William Nicholson books at a local school where he had been asked to talk about writing to a hundred 12-13 year-olds. We were warned in advance that the school was in an area that wasn't very 'bookish' and when we optimistically arrived with 20 copies of each of his five novels for children, but I soon realised that there was no point in unpacking most of the boxes.The talk took place in the school gym and it had that smell - the odour of sawdust, sweat and stale polish. We set up our stall on a table at the back and watched nervously as the children filed noisily into the hall. A teacher tried to silence the din of chattering children and scraping chairs, but the noise continued until the head teacher arrived and did what must have been her scary look - a disapproving frown which implied that names would be taken and punishments allotted to the guilty parties. The noise diminished until the hall was almost silent.'We are very lucky to have a writer...' the head teacher paused. She had no idea who she was introducing. William Nicholson smiled and told her who he was. She continued and I could tell that the words writer and author were not going to impress this audience. They shuffled in their seats, spoke in loud whispers and I began to worry, but William Nicholson knew exactly what to do.First he explained that he was a little jet-lagged as he had just flown back from Hollywood where he was negotiating a film deal. Yes, he wrote children's books, but he also wrote screenplays for films. Had anyone seen Gladiator? From that moment there was a tangible change in the audience and apart from a small core of dysfunctional boys at the back, he had the children in the palm of his hand. They listened.At the end of the talk we only sold 10 books and several people apologised to us. However, I'm a great believer in the little acorns...mighty oaks approach to life. 80% of the pupils were interested in what Nicholson had to say and perhaps even a few of them will remember this day for the rest of their lives."},

{"title": "Legoland", "date": "Monday, June 25, 2007", "text": "I have just returned from Legoland with my older son. It was almost exactly what I expected: a soulless, corporate theme park in which the concept of adventure has been commodified, stripped of risk and regurgitated as a bland, postmodern succession of experiences. My son loved it and wants to go back as today's trip was cut short by torrential rain. I shall try to stall him.I paid £47 for our two tickets, which was extortionate. However I kept telling myself that once you paid up front, everything was free and you could go on as many rides as you liked. If only. The 'free' bus from Windsor to Legoland cost £5.80, lockers could only be opened with a one pound coin which was non-refundable and a booth with hot air dryers for victims of water rides cost £2 per 30-second blast of hot air. And as for going on as many rides as you like, if a 20-minute queue was the norm for a very wet day in term time, how many rides could you conceivably go on during weekends and school holidays? I'd heard that families spent up to five hours queuing for less than 20 minutes' worth of rides. Indeed, psychologists have identified the new phenomenon of 'ride rage' caused by the stress of queuing in theme parks.In addition to getting very wet, my son and I had to endure the humiliation of beating our way through the crowds to get away from the front of the queue, once we discovered that our ride was a big dipper. We're both thenthitive individuals and don't need that sort of adrenaline rush.I hate theme parks. Once upon a time children could go off into the countryside and have real adventures. My father grew-up only eight miles away from the centre of London but in those days - the 1930s - he was on the edge of the urban environment and could cycle out to fields and woods within less than half an hour. Today many children live in shoddy, grey suburbs, denied a normal childhood by parents who are paranoid about cars and paedophiles. Spontaneity, adventure and fun has been denied to many of today's children. Their craving to visit places like Legoland is understandable and very, very sad."},
{"title": "The Waterstone's scandal", "date": "Saturday, June 23, 2007", "text": "Some prominent figures in the book world have expressed their dismay over the discovery that Waterstone's charges publishers up to £45,000 to secure a front-of-shop position for their titles. One of the most vocal opponents is Anthony Cheetham, who complains that Waterstone's are 'breaking the unwritten contract with the customer.'  In their defence, Waterstone's argue that books are bought on merit and the deals are secured after a title has been selected.I'm surprised at the level of naivety on the part of many people. Waterstone's is not a philanthropic society - it's a business which is largely run by retailers who have worked for companies like Marks and Spencer. Their remit is to ensure that Waterstone's makes a profit for its parent company, HMV Media and in order to achieve this they have introduced practices that were once alien to bookselling but common in other areas of retail, including asking suppliers to subsidise promotions. Borders do it and WH Smith's certainly do, charging up to £200,000!Publishers like to moan when retailers behave like cynical opportunists, but they are being completely hypocritical. Publishers have been happy enough to undermine high street booksellers by offering preferential terms to supermarkets and internet retailers and when they mounted a spirited opposition to Waterstone's proposed takeover of Ottakar's, they failed to acknowledge their complicity.So has the bond of trust between Waterstone's and its customers been broken? I wasn't aware that there was one. Waterstone's is a brand. The brand is that it is a quality bookseller with a large stockholding and knowledgeable staff. If they start promoting crap just because they've had a backhander from a publisher then customers will vote with their feet and they know that.As far as I can tell, the promoted titles in Waterstone's are, first and foremost, picked by a buying team who have a background in bookselling and try to pick what will sell. No self-respecting retailer would risk alienating their customers by putting poor quality products in their front-of-shop and Waterstone's cannot afford to be the exception. If Waterstone's had remained the bookseller that some people still like to think it is it would have gone under years ago.I'm actually surprised by how bookish Waterstone's still is, given the current market conditions, but that's largely thanks to the booksellers, not the senior management."},
{"title": "Scotland", "date": "Thursday, June 21, 2007", "text": "I have been getting increasingly excited the last few weeks as tomorrow night, I am booked on an intercity sleeper train to the Scottish Highlands. The train leaves London at 21.15 arriving in Fort William 12 and a half hours later. I booked this trip several months ago as I thought that my increasingly anxious older son needed to overcome his fear of new experiences. I planned the journey down to the last detail and apart from the weather, I felt that I had everything covered. However, I had not bargained on the ineptitude of FirstScot Rail, who don't believe that buying a ticket two months in advance should guarantee you a seat on a train.I discovered this detail today after phoning to enquire why my tickets said No Seat. After being kept on hold for 40 minutes I was given another phone number, which kept me on hold for another 20 minutes. I always thought that anecdotes like these were apocryphal, as I've always had good experiences with internet booking. However, FirstScot Rail are the exception. I should have taken the hint two months ago, when my call was rerouted to someone in India who thought that I lived in Lewisham.My son hasn't stopped talking about this trip. He's told his friends about it and has been preparing his backpack, so when I discovered that there was no room on the train for us I was dreading his reaction. Would it be the sort of disappointment that he would remember for the rest of his life? I racked my brains to think of an alternative. Paris! We could go on the Channel Tunnel and be there within three hours. But there was a small matter of finding a passport.I couldn't just tell him that the trip was off, so I decided to book a ticket in Legoland with a night at a posh hotel in Windsor.He was remarkably stoic about the whole thing and I think that the Legoland plan was a masterstroke - rugged Scottish glens and mountains are no match for a crass, commercialised theme park in the mind of a small boy.In the meantime we are stranded in Sussex, which isn't the worst fate in the world."},
{"title": "Blogito Ergo Sum", "date": "Wednesday, June 20, 2007", "text": "Yesterday's big news story was the announcement that Britain's prisons are full up. 81,000 prisoners are currently residing at Her Majesty's pleasure and there are no cells left. To create space some prisoners are being released early, which has prompted a hysterical outburst in the tabloids. If you believe the Daily Mail, an army of rapists, paedophiles and murderers are banging at the gates, waiting to resume their outrages. The reality is that minor offenders are leaving prison a couple of weeks earlier, but that makes a dull headline.I don't think anyone is happy with this situation. Whilst justice has always been subject to expedience as much, if not more, than any concept of moral law, the public expect the punishment to fit the crime and early release should be subject to good behaviour, not overcrowding. However, if there are no places for new prisoners the whole justice system will grind to a halt. What is the answer?Building new prisons should be the last resort. I would prefer to see a concerted effort to deal with the causes of crime, but that is a long-term solution and will do nothing to deal with the current problem.In the short-term, it would make sense to deport prisoners who are foreign nationals to prisons in their own countries (except anyone whose safety might be endangered). Over 10,000 prisoners - 13% of the total prison population - are foreigners without residency in the UK and cost the tax payer approximately £400,000,000.In the mid-term, something must be done to address the appalling scandal of the way we treat people with serious mental illnesses. In the past, people who were unable to function in society were detained in what used to be called asylums. I remember visiting someone in a mental hospital when I was in my teens (just before Margaret Thatcher decided to introduce the disastrous 'care in the community' policy which closed many residential psychiatric hospitals and saw the number of beggars on the streets rise dramatically). I was quite apprehensive about going there and when I saw a man in a dressing gown walk towards me saying 'And they spoke to me in heavenly voices' I almost turned and fled. But I stayed and discovered a peaceful sanctuary with beautiful gardens that provided a refuge from the chaos of 'real' life. An asylum in the true sense of the word.A significant number of people in prison should be in a secure mental unit, not a prison. As one prisoner officer said to me, 'I went into this service to look after prisoners, not become a psychiatric nurse' and I remember him pointing in two directions, saying that one prison wing was for the mad, the other for the bad. You might argue that all I'm proposing is a different form of imprisonment, but I think it's important to differentiate between offenders who are responsible for their actions and those who suffer from a mental illness and need help.As for the long-term solution - dealing with the causes of crime - I know that there are no easy answers. However there are a number of widely-accepted causal factors: a high number of teenage pregnancies, a lack of male role models, poor housing, inadequate special needs provision, drugs, endemic unemployment and poor education.In America it has been shown that cutting social security benefits has reduced teenage pregnancies, but is that a morally acceptable course of action? Should we penalise people who are already having a pretty crappy life? Other studies have proved that the easiest way to reduce the birth rate amongst the poorest parts of society is through providing women with more educational opportunities. Not sex education, but real learning that empowers women and makes them feel that they have choices in life."},

When I first started in bookselling I remember that we usually stocked at least three of Cheever's novels, plus an anthology of his short stories, but the the author deemed the Chekhov of the suburbs seems to have gone out of fashion. Like Richard Yates, he will probably be rediscovered. In the meantime, Cheever fans will have to trawl the internet for second-hand editions of most of his major works.My interest in Cheever started when I watched the film adaptation of his short story The Swimmer, filmed in 1968 starring Burt Lancaster. I watched it by chance on television and was bowled over by the cinematography and Burt Lancaster's mesmerising performance. I have never understood why this film isn't more popular. If people can enjoy films like The Ice Storm and American Beauty then I'm sure that they can relate to The Swimmer."},

{"title": "Dumbing down", "date": "Saturday, June 16, 2007", "text": "I will shortly be watching The People's Quiz, a lamentable programme that professes to find the cleverest people in Britain but is in fact a general knowledge contest with moronically easy questions like 'In what country do they eat sushi?' The worst thing is the look of pained concentration on the contestants' faces. The second worst is the exultant applause that they receive for knowing something that anyone who hasn't been abducted and kept in a cellar for twenty years should know as a matter of course. Are we becoming more stupid?As if in answer to this question, I found a book from 1972 called the Top of the Form Quiz Book, based on a contest for schoolchildren between the ages of 14-16. Even a cursory glance confirmed that the questions were much harder than today's quiz show for adults. They wouldn't just ask which king had six wives, but expect the contestant to list them in chronological order.So there we have it - conclusive evidence that we are more ignorant than we were in 1972. But is it true? I think that the answer is more a reflection on the programme making today, rather than the knowledge or ignorance of the general public. The People's Quiz is broadcast in the prime time pre-Doctor Who slot on Saturday evening, with the promise of top twenty ratings. I suspect that the BBC want an inclusive programme that makes the ordinary viewer feel clever. If they had a proper quiz show with genuinely tough questions, many viewers might feel demoralised and turn over. And although the BBC isn't a commercial station, its remit is justified by viewing figures.The multi-channel age has completely changed television in Britain. Programme makers are usually too timid to experiment with challenging formats that demand concentration and the traditional 13-part serial has been replaced by attention-deficit-friendly two-parters. I'm not sure why this is the case. In America there have been a number of series that have bucked the trend and dared to present an innovative story spanning a 26-episode arc. They have a post-modern Tarantinoesque narrative structure and are packed full of obscure references that would require a Classics degree to deconstruct them.But the ratings are nearly always good.Perhaps it isn't the public who have dumbed down, but the programme makers, afraid of alienating viewers with anything challenging or innovative. They're wrong. The public aren't as stupid as they look."},

However I am unable to stop myself shopping on-line under the influence of alcohol.It's a familiar scenario. I arrive home from work, have a couple of glasses of wine to wind down and decide to relax for an hour by surfing the internet. That's where the trouble starts. The alcohol loosens my inhibitions and suddenly it seems like a good idea to order a DVD of The Cruel Sea.This must be what it's like to have an affair. First there's the excitement of the moment, followed by the regret and guilt the following morning. Finally, there's the moment of reckoning when your partner discovers what you've done.During the last few months I've ordered the following:A wall clock featuring the animated characters from the BBC series Life on MarsA meteoriteA CD of Finnish accordion musicA boxed DVD set of the first series of Starsky and HutchA Queen Elizabeth I silver sixpenceAn LP of Hilding Rosenberg's 8th SymphonyAs the advert said 'Men just can't help acting on impulse.'But it's not all regret and guilt. I love my meteorite and get a thrill every time I hold the sixpence in my hand and imagine all of the other people who have possessed it. I have also bought some really good things on the internet during my nocturnal shopping trips in cyberspace. Perhaps my best purchase was a pair of Doc Marten shoes that were produced for the Royal Mail and are still in perfect condition after two years' constant use.However, there should be some software available that makes it harder to buy things over the internet after 6.00 in the evening. Every time I decide to buy something, I'd like to see a little pop-up box that says 'Do you really need it?', 'Where will you put it?' 'Will you be any happier if you buy it?' and 'Can you afford it?' The software would also refuse to process my purchases until I'd had 12 hours to think about it.That makes sense."},
{"title": "Self-publishing", "date": "Sunday, June 10, 2007", "text": "My fellow booksellers Crockatt and Powell recently published an excellent post about self-publishing, the gist of which was don't do it. I couldn't agree more. There are some instances where a book that would be of no interest to a mainstream publisher can find a successful niche market. Many local history books thrive without the support of a proper publisher and end up selling more than the Booker Prize shortlist. However, when it comes to fiction, poetry or autobiography, you can forget it.I have lost count of the number of times that I've been told that 'there's someone downstairs who wants to see the manager' only to find myself confronted with someone waving a volume that looks as if it was printed in Albania, circa 1975.When I first started in bookselling I used to take every self-published book I was shown because I wanted to support local authors, but when it came to weeding-out the unsold books from sections I gradually realised that self-published fiction and poetry never sold, unless the author was able to badger their friends and family into buying a copy. Sometimes this added-up to a loss of several thousand pounds a year. The books were always sold on a sale or return basis, but when it came to sending the unsold copy back to the author and getting credit, they were usually quite elusive, so gradually I became hardened by my experiences and learned to say no.I always try to remain open-minded about self-published books. Every now and then I see one which is genuinely good and deserves to be supported, but nine times out of ten they are rubbish and I find that the author's ego is inversely proportional to their talent. Quite often I have self-published authors who march into my shop and announced that they've come to arrange a signing session.I'm also astounded by the number of people who publish a book without doing any research into how the book trade works. They present books without barcodes, have no distributor and haven't arranged any publicity and yet they still manage to look wounded or incredulous when I am less than enthusiastic.During the last few years I have had to tactfully deal with the following self-published books:The memoirs of an airline pilot who had led an interesting life, but didn't possess the ability to make it interesting to others. Also the book looked like a pamphlet from the Soviet EmbassyAn appallingly-written children's story about horses with a cheap and nasty psychedelic cover that looked like a parish newsletter from the Church of the Poison MindA poetry anthology written by eight members of a family, all equally talentlessA photographic book about the Battle of Trafalgar 200th anniversary celebrations. The author paid for several thousand copies of the book to be printed before doing any research into his potential market. When I said that £30 was too much for a paperback photographic book of this nature, he looked at me as if I had insulted his motherA historical novel that was so stomach-churningly awful that I hid it for the author's sakeA 'thriller' about global warming that read as if it had been badly translated from LatvianA children's book called Teddy's Magical Adventure which was full of grammatical howlers like should ofA self-help CD encouraging children to contact angels, narrated by a woman who asks the listener to start relaxin' and see the shinin' aura around their bedI realise that I probably sound a little lacking in compassion, but it's a reaction to the arrogance and/or self-delusion of the authors. Show me a good self-published book and I'll support it all the way:Here's the author, whose son-in-law presented me with a self-published book that had a good story that was well told. I gave it pride of place in the front of the shop.Publishers aren't infallible and occasionally a really good book slips through the net, for example Jill Paton Walsh's Knowledge of Angels. However, on the whole, if a book is really good it will eventually get the recognition it deserves. JK Rowling was a struggling author who had to cope with several rejections, but someone eventually spotted her talent. Self-publishing offers an opportunity to jump the queue, but it's an illusory one because booksellers rarely take a self-published book seriously."},
{"title": "More than a bookshop", "date": "Friday, June 08, 2007", "text": "When my bookshop opened, almost exactly two years ago, we decided that we wanted to be more than a retail outlet. We were situated in a town that didn't have a thriving arts scene, but did have a number of talented people who wanted to display their work and stage events.We decided to try and make ourselves a hub for the local community by turning our shop into a mini arts centre and in additional to the usual author signings and talks, we displayed the work of local artists and set-up reading groups. But our most radical move was a foray into the world of fringe theatre.Last night we staged our fifth theatrical event, a performance of David Mamet's Duck Variations by two drama graduates, one of whom happened to be the manager of another branch. It was almost closed down by a funny little man from the Council who saw the posters for the show and decided that we were probably violating an obscure by-law. However, we managed to obtain a licence in the nick of time.We held the play here:But it's amazing what you can do with a bit of black cloth and a studio light:And here is a photo from the performance:Hey presto! A simple bookshop becomes a theatrical venue. When I tell people about our dramatic evenings some think it's a brilliant idea and others look at me as if I'm mad. I'm convinced that in an age in which an increasing number of readers are buying their books from Amazon and Tesco, booksellers have to do more to exploit their greatest asset - the physical space of a bookshop. People still love bookshops and it is up to booksellers to provide the magic."},
{"title": "Carbon footprints", "date": "Tuesday, June 05, 2007", "text": "Suddenly everyone seems to be talking about carbon footprints. It's great. I'd spent years despairing that people would ever take environmental concerns seriously and suddenly, like a Mexican wave, global warming has become a mainstream issue. Customers have started declining bags, people in Waterstone's head office are talking about reducing wastage and my local council are going to penalise anyone who doesn't recycle.I decided to find out what my carbon footprint was and take steps to reduce it. On the plus side I have energy-saving light bulbs, a small house and don't fly (well, very rarely). On the minus side I drive 200 miles a week, have a wife who obsessed with turning the thermostat up to 23c and only recycle my wine bottles. How bad am I?I have looked at several carbon footprint websites and I'm still none the wiser. One carbon footprint 'calculator' has asked me very specific questions about my gas consumption whilst another is content to make assumptions based on fairly nebulous criteria. The average carbon footprint of people in Britain is around 9,500kg (19,000 in America; 1,200 in India). According to the CF calculators, my footprint could be anywhere between 5,500 and 9,500, which is quite a large margin of error.If someone like me who is informed and sympathetic about green issues feels baffled and cynical about these calculators, then what is the ordinary person in the street going to feel? I'd like to see a calculator that is easy to use but detailed enough to account for everyone's unique circumstances, so that they can identify the areas of their life that need changing.In the meantime I aim to do the following:Only buy organic products that haven't been flown halfway across the worldStop buying beefCompost our food wasteHave showers instead of bathsPersuade my wife to wear a woolly jumper when it's coldAnd I would love to be able to do the followingBan all 4x4s (SUVs) unless the owner lives in the countrysideHave a VAT rate of 50% for food that has travelled more than 5,000 milesBan the sale of patio gas heatersOffer tax incentives to anyone who installs energy-saving measuresMake biodiesel available at filling stationsAnd finally (and this is nothing to do with the environment), I would ban the wearing of Crocs."},
{"title": "Book thieves", "date": "Saturday, June 02, 2007", "text": "In his memoirs, Jeffrey Bernard used to talk about the distinct social groups that frequented his regular pub, the notorious Coach and Horses in Soho. Alongside the actors, stage hands, dancers and drunks, there were the book thieves.The book thieves were professionals who stole to order, usually selling their wares to a bookseller in Charing Cross Road. They were only paid a fraction of the retail price of the book and in order to achieve a living wage, they would have to steal at least £50,000 worth of stock per year. Of course they stole a lot more than that. Sometimes they'd get caught and were occasionally sent to prison, but once the sentence was served they'd be back in the shops doing what they knew best.The most notorious book thief in London was a man called Roy Faith. When he died, a store detective company sent a representative to his funeral, as he'd been done so much for their business. A short, plump man with sunken eyes and a bald head that had a few strands of dyed, jet black hair across it, Roy's speciality was art books.Roy always made two visits to a shop. During the first he would choose the books he was going to steal - nothing under £30 - and pile them up somewhere where they wouldn't be spotted. After leaving the shop empty-handed, Roy would wait for half an hour and return when the staff were too busy to spot him. It only took Roy a minute to discretely nudge the pile of books into his huge holdall and before we had a chance to spot him, he was gone.Perhaps Roy was nice to his dog if he had one, but he didn't come across as a particularly pleasant individual. When a female member of staff asked him to leave, he called her a cunt and moved as if he was going to headbut her. I mistakenly assumed that he was the sort of person who only threatened women and the next time I saw him I unsuccessfully tried to play the hard man: 'Come on then, call me a cunt.' Roy looked at me with barely disguised contempt and replied 'Alright then, you're a cunt' then took a half-hearted swing at me. I ducked and he missed. From then on, our encounters became increasingly childish with both of us trying to do everything we could to frustrate the other. The last time I saw him, he was on the train to Brighton, probably combining a bit of thieving with a nice day at the seaside.Another thief, known as  Barry, specialised in stealing the Times Atlas. At £75 each, these atlases were very attractive to thieves and the only thing that usually stopped anyone taking them was their enormous size, which made them almost impossible to conceal. They didn't fit into carrier bags or holdalls without a considerable effort, but Barry had devised a solution that was almost worthy of genius. He had customised a raincoat with Times Atlas-sized pockets on the inside and was able to steal two at a time. The more astute members of staff usually challenged the strange man with two large book-sized lumps in his coat, but he must have succeeded enough times to make it worth his while. Unlike Roy Faith, Barry did have some personal charm and when caught, he would smile sheepishly like a little boy caught scrumping.After a while I became quite good at spotting the biblioklepts. Sometimes they gave themselves away through their body language, other times it was their appearance. One thief was dressed as a respectable businessman but his shoes were shabby and when I scrutinised him further I could see that he was wearing a charity shop suit. Our eyes met and he realised that he'd been rumbled. Later I mentioned this incident to someone in another bookshop and they said 'Ah yes, the Businessman.' He was well-known.The most successful thieves were the ones we never saw. Someone used to steal entire shelves of books during Thursday lunchtimes - one week it was Nabokov, another Terry Pratchett - presumably in order to furnish another bookshop. Although we became obsessive about checking everyone who entered the shop, we never caught the culprit.Occasionally we were provided with undercover store detectives - usually ex-servicemen or African students. In patrician Richmond, their attemps at blending in with the customers rarely succeeded. We also employed a paranoid ex-policeman who seemed to believe that everyone was a potential criminal and used to stalk perfectly normal people until they felt so uncomfortable they left.In the end the only thing that really stopped the traditional book thieves was the advent of CCTV, internet bookselling and the end of price fixing. Of course we still lose books. There are a few professional thieves still doing the rounds and there are also drug addicts and opportunists, but the golden age of book theft has passed.It used to be even worse in medieval times and many books had to be chained to the wall. Here is a curse that was used at the time to deter would-be thieves:This present book legible in scriptureHere in this place thus tacched with a cheynPurposed of entent for to endureAnd here perpetuelli stylle to remeyneFro eyre to eyre wherfore appone peynOf cryst is curs of faders and of moderesNon of hem hens atempt it to dereyneWhille ani leef may goodeli hange with oder."},
{"title": "A sense of place", "date": "Friday, June 01, 2007", "text": "I am that rare creature, someone who is completely English. I used to envy friends who could boast mixed ancestry as they always seemed to have a richer life, spending their school holidays abroad visiting eccentric relatives. I have a couple of friends who have Irish mothers and thanks to the post-war diaspora of people from Ireland, they have uncles and aunts in every port. My family doesn't even come from another part of England. Both sides originate from the Home Counties and the most daring thing we ever did was to move to London in the 1840s and leave it 150 years later.And it wasn't even as if we could say that we'd lived here for thousands of years. According to received wisdom, we were descended from Danish and German invaders who usurped the native Britons in the fifth century. It might sound a long time ago, but go to certain parts of Wales and they're still angry about it.A few years ago I decided to walk the South Downs Way, which is almost exactly 100 miles, starting in Winchester and ending at the sea in Eastbourne. Most of the paths were routes that had been in use for thousands of years. I felt a sense of connection with all of the people who had used these paths in the past, whether they were hunters, Roman legionnaires or shepherds. But I knew that it was unlikely that I was descended from any of them and in some ways, I felt like  an interloper.However, recent DNA tests have turned conventional wisdom on its head. It now seems that most people in Britain are descended from settlers who arrived after the last ice age, 20,000 years ago and I like that. I don't have any dodgy racial agenda. I just believe that an awareness of our past protects us from the ephemeral values of capitalism and gives us a sense of perspective.I am lucky enough to live in Lewes - a town centred around an 800-year-old castle with an eclectic mix of buildings including a medieval priory and a 15th-century shop. My house is relatively modern, built in 1890, but it's situated on a 12-century battlefield. When I walk through the town I feel that my life is a very small part of the story of Lewes. That may sound trite as it's a truism, but look at the number of towns and cities who survived the Luftwaffe only to to ruined by the greed and short-termism of post-war town planning. Lewes almost became a victim but common sense prevailed and everywhere I look, the dead live among us.This is a very rambling post, written after several glasses of wine which I awarded myself after a hard day, but I hope you see my point: the past is a buffer, a defence against those people who know the price of everything and the value of nothing. That doesn't mean going back to the past. I have no nostalgia for the age of racism, backstreet abortions and intolerance towards homosexuals. However, we need to be freed from the tyranny of the present so that we can get things into perspective."},

I can understand why. Seeing the film for the second, third and fourth time, I am still shocked by appalling, visceral horror of the scene. Apparently the other members of the cast weren't told what was going to happen and their looks of disgust when the alien bursts out are entirely genuine.Alien is a masterpiece, tapping into our deepest fears about violation. It's a great pity that this film ended up becoming a franchise, culminating in the appalling Aliens vs Predator. But is this the greatest moment in cinema? I can think of several others, but the one that stands head and shoulders above everything else is the denoument of Planet of the Apes.I remember watching this film for the first time when I was 12. I was too young to have seen any of the films at the cinema and knew nothing about the plot. When, at the end of the film, the camera pans away and Charlton Heston realises that he has been on Earth all the time, it is genuinely shocking.As soon as I start to think of memorable moments in film my mind runs away...Etc..."},

{"title": "Hug a Hoodie", "date": "Sunday, May 27, 2007", "text": "On Thursday afternoon my wife phoned me at work: 'Sorry to bother you but someone's just phoned from the court and you're down to do an ASBO tomorrow. They're sending over some documents by courier and you've got to study them tonight.' I could barely contain my glee. At last, something really juicy. Last week I was signing warrants and dealing with unpaid council tax, trying to appear interested but failing miserably. An Anti-Social Behaviour Order would at least give me the opportunity to use my brain.I studied the documents as soon as I got home. The offender was 17 and his first recorded offence occurred four years earlier, when he was caught in possession of cannabis. Since then he had built up a depressingly long list of crimes including theft, burglary, assault and vandalism. I tried to keep an open mind, but after I'd read the witness statements I couldn't help thinking that he must be a nasty piece of work. He seemed to have no respect for authority and was completely out of control. An ASBO wouldn't stop him, but it would at least make it easier to give a custodial sentence next time he committed a crime.The next morning I went to court with a very clear mental picture of what sort of person I'd be dealing with, but when the door to the courtroom opened I was taken aback. He looked no older than 13 and announced his name in a boy soprano voice. I had imagined a tough-looking character with an expression of contempt, but this boy simply looked bemused. His face showed no fear, anger or contempt and apart from an occasional nervous tic, it was hard to tell what was going on in his mind.Before the terms of the ASBO were discussed we were given the boy's life history, which turned out to be one of the saddest things I'd ever heard. He had several siblings, all of whom were in care. He had been kicked out of his family home when he was fifteen and by all accounts, his parents (who didn't live together) were completely feckless. Since then he had lived either in hostels or with friends. He had stopped going to school several years earlier and he had the reading age of a five-year-old. He got into frequent trouble because he was part of a gang who, like him, were completely unemployable and had nothing to do except hang around and make a nuisance of themselves.It was clear that this boy wasn't 'evil' or even just bad. He was a lost soul who had been appallingly neglected by both his family and society and in the absence of any love or discipline, he had drifted through life until he found a new family as part of his gang. As I listened to his tragic life history I wished that there was something I could do. What good would an ASBO do?I retired with my colleagues and we were shortly joined by the legal advisor. We all felt the same - if only there was something we could do. This boy should be taught how to read properly and then be given the opportunity to learn a trade - something that would boost his self-esteem and give him opportunities. He also desperately needed an adult mentor who cared about him. How had he been allowed to slip through the net?We decided that he needed the ASBO as his behaviour was out of control and he needed boundaries. We had reservations, but were assured that this was a preventive action rather than a punitive one. We were  also reassured to discover that if he violates the conditions of the order he will, at last, find himself in 'the system'. If only he could have benefited from intervention at an earlier stage.Getting help for children with special needs is extremely difficult. My wife fought tooth and nail to get support for our dyslexic son and when she finally succeeded the result was a dramatic improvement. If a middle-class graduate struggles to get assistance for her child, what hope does a poorly-educated person have, particularly one who has a low intelligence and/or a substance abuse problem? The authorities always cite funding as an issue, but compare the cost of helping a problem child to keeping an adult in prison. The current set-up is not only a false economy but also morally bankrupt."},
{"title": "The Meaning of the 21st Century", "date": "Wednesday, May 23, 2007", "text": "There are lots of books around that speculate how life will change during the next 100 years, but very few that have the authority of someone whose predictions have been vindicated by the passage of time. James Lovelock is the most obvious example, but equally deserving of attention is James Martin. In the mid-70s he wrote a book called The Wired Society which has proved to be remarkably prescient, anticipating inventions like the internet and mobile phones. Last year he published a book called The Meaning of the 21st Century, which sets out to analyse the challenges that mankind faces and suggest solutions.According to Martin we are on the verge of either a golden age or a collapse. The outcome depends entirely on what choices we make during the next decade. He lists 16 possible threats to our existence:1.  Global warming2.  Excessive population growth3.  Water shortages4.  Destruction of ocean life5.  Mass famine in poorly-run countries6.  The spread of deserts7.  Pandemics8.  Extreme poverty9.  Growth of shanty-cities10. Unstoppable global migrations11. Terrorists with WMDs12. Religious extremism13. Runaway computer intelligence14. Nuclear war15. A new Dark Age16. Scientific experimentationIt's a terrifying list. Some events are unlikely but nevertheless pretty scary (for example I had no idea that when scientists built an atom-smashing machine there was a very remote possibility that it could have started a chain reaction that would destroy the universe!) whilst others seem a certainty. But Martin's book is not designed to overwhelm the reader with a sense of helplessness. On the contrary, this is a very positive book that clearly demonstrates that most problems can be easily remedied. All that is required is the political will.If I was a dictator I would make everyone read this book (although I suppose I wouldn't have to, as I would be able to implement all of James Martin's recommendations without any opposition).If you want an overview of what the next 50 years is probably going to look like, this is the book to buy.Every time I go to my annual managers' meeting - previously at Ottakar's, now at Waterstone's - vowing to go to bed early and not drink too much. Every year I fail. However I can at least take comfort in the fact that this year I wasn't sick on the train and haven't had to spend a whole day in bed afterwards. I must be getting older and wiser. Or maybe it was a text message that my wife sent me at midnight which read Remember yr less witty when yr drunk.It is now 25 years since the first branch of Waterstone's opened and the mood of the gala dinner was generally celebratory, with guest authors paying tribute to their favourite bookshop chain. However, amidst the anecdotes about favourite branches and the thrill authors felt at seeing their books on the shelves, there was one conspicuous absence. No-one mentioned the man who made it all possible: Tim Waterstone.It would probably be something of an understatement to say that Tim Waterstone is not very popular with the current owners of the chain that bears his name. He regularly criticises them and occasionally launches abortive attempts to buy the company back. However, for all his faults we owe him a debt of gratitude. Thanks to Tim Waterstone's vision and entrepreneurial flair, most towns in Britain now have a bookshop with a decent stockholding and the benefits to readers and publishers have been enormous. I drank to his health."},
{"title": "All the names", "date": "Saturday, May 19, 2007", "text": "I've just finished reading Yuri Buida's weird and wonderful Zero Train, published by the excellent Dedalus Books. It was a typically Russian novel, with larger than life characters whose dialogue alternated between philosophical musings and impassioned outbursts. All very Dostoevsky. The novel was also typically Russian in a way I found less appealing: everyone seemed to have at least three names. This made for a very confusing read at times and although a glossary was helpfully provided, it was less helpfully placed at the end of the book. Reading the list of names, patronyms and nicknames for each character, I realised that I had made two very silly mistakes about who was who which completely altered the novel's meaning. How annoying.It's for this reason that I haven't read War and Peace. I'm not bothered about the length. I read Les Miserables and really enjoyed it, but if Victor Hugo had been a Russian I'm not sure if I could have contended with the fact that Jean Valjean was also called Jean Pierreovitch or Tinker. When you have an epic novel with nearly 500 characters, the last thing you need is any confusion about who's who. What I need isn't an abridged version of War and Peace, but an amended one in which everyone has one name and sticks to it."},

As a bookseller it's a sizeable chunk of my salary, but when I discovered that a limited edition print of Eric Ravilious' painting Chalk Paths was on sale, I had to buy it. This is a rare picture that succeeds in capturing both the spiritual and visual qualities of the South Downs and anyone who knows the area will recognise the dark greens and greys of the Sussex winter. Compare this picture with another depiction of the Downs:Or this:And it is the difference between art and illustration. Ravilious was arguably one of the greatest British artists of the inter-war years and if his life hadn't ended prematurely, I'm sure that he would be a household name (in Hampstead, at least).I first discovered Eric Ravilious in the Towner Gallery at Eastbourne, where I went to see an exhibition of original Ladybird illustrations. As soon as I saw his paintings, I knew that I had found a kindred spirit and spent the next few years searching for anything I could find about Ravilious.Today there is a growing Ravilious cult. He is one of those word-of-mouth figures (like Nick Drake 20 years ago) who has a devoted following and it is only a matter of time before he becomes as well-known as Paul Nash and Henry Moore.To return to Chalk Paths, there is a piece of music that complements Ravilious' watercolour: the Pastoral Symphony by Alan Rawsthorne. If you play the last movement of the symphony and look at the painting, there is a striking sympatico between the two."},
{"title": "Centre Parcs", "date": "Sunday, May 13, 2007", "text": "It's just like the Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Suddenly, friends and acquaintances - all intelligent people with impeccable taste - keep telling me that they've been to Centre Parcs for a break. Their explanations are so similar that it's quite sinister: 'Well I know it has a bit of a naff reputation, but actually it's very nice and great for families. You have your own chalet, no cars are allowed and you can hire bikes.' All said with a wide-eyed smile that makes me feel very nervous. Next it will be the bloody Alpha Course.Worst of all my wife started to think that it might not be such a bad idea after all. There were, she was told, lots of people that my father-in-law irritatingly refers to as PLUs (People Like Us). I mentioned this to my mother-in-law, as I thought that she'd shudder in horror at the prospect but no, she'd heard good things about Centre Parcs too.In a rare moment of humility, I conceded that I might be wrong. After all, I'd been wrong about Battlestar Galactica. How could I selfishly maintain my stand in the light of overwhelming support for Centre Parcs from just about everyone I knew? 'Go on then' I said one evening, 'Order the brochure and if it doesn't look too awful, I'll do it.'Three days later a package landed on the doormat and we were delighted to see that it contained a DVD of the Centre Parcs experience. I poured a glass of wine and focused on keeping a positive frame of mind, but within seconds an inner voice screamed 'NO! DON'T MAKE ME GO THERE. IT'S AWFUL!'. The whole place looked like something out of Logan's Run - a manufactured utopia for the middle managers of middle England. Nice men called Steve who worked in Human Resources and their 2.4 children. I wish I could be happy like Steve and cycle through pleasant woodlands with my family before enjoying the vast fayre of international cuisine. Unlike Logan's Run, people aren't killed at the age of 30, but it is a form of death.There was an awkward silence for a few minutes. Normally my wife and I love and hate the same things, but given the current Body Snatchers scenario, supposing she'd gone over to the other side? 'Oh no.' She suddenly said with conviction. 'We couldn't go there.' I felt a huge wave of relief and gratitude. I had begun to doubt my sanity. Perhaps I was just a lone misanthrope, bent on stopping my family having fun and subjecting them to my jaundiced views, rather than a sane rational individual who objected to the commoditisation  of leisure. But no, my wife's instant revulsion (and she's a much nicer person than me) convinced me that all was not lost.As for the friends, I'm still in a quandary. In every other respect they are beyond reproach. I can only conclude that something happened to them at Centre Parcs and if we go there it will happen to us to. Stay away, if you know what's good for you."},

But perhaps the most striking recording is one of Florence Nightingale (who by coincidence is 187 years old today).Recorded in 1890, the sound quality is naturally very poor, but most of the words are clearly discernible and it is amazing to think that you're listening to the voice of someone who was born in Regency England.Click on the picture for a link to the recording."},

{"title": "Regulars", "date": "Friday, May 11, 2007", "text": "When booksellers get together what do we talk about? Books? Yes, sometimes - I remember waking up on a floor after a party and discovering that everyone in the room had read Gitta Sereny's book about Albert Speer - but our favourite topic of conversation is probably the weird people that frequent our shops. I'm not talking about the customers. They usually come in, browse for a while and buy a book, which doesn't make a great anecdote. However in addition to customers, all bookshops have loyal clientele of regular browsers who managed to visit the shop every day without ever buying a book.We have nicknames for all of our browsers. In one shop I worked in our regulars included 'Crying Man' who always looked as if he was on the verge of bursting into tears, 'Reading Man' who ran everywhere and kept wiping the sweat from his brow with a handkerchief and 'Chess Man' who read our chess books and stubbornly refused to leave when the shop closed. In another we had a woman who came in every morning to check her horoscope and managed to break the spines of the books to the point where we couldn't sell them.In my current shop we have 'Shuffling Man', who displays an unhealthy interest in the Children's section and a man who I identified yesterday as 'Weird Arm Man'. His right arm is very strange indeed. The veins are all thick and look like someone has stuck long sausages to his skin. Also, when he reads he holds the book about an inch away from his nose. Yesterday at 5.30 I walked through the shop and checked that it was empty. 'No customers left.' I announced in a loud voice 'Even Weird Arm Man' has gone. But he hadn't. He was crouching down next to the Erotica section reading Schoolgirl Lust. I think he heard me.I thought that it was an unwritten rule that if you wanted to use your local bookshop as a library, you would do them the courtesy of occasionally buying a book (even if it's only once a year), but our browsers seem ignorant of this convention. Therefore, I have decided to write a simple constitution for browsers. If you're a browser, obey these rules and we'll stop hating you:Buy a book, however cheap, at least once a yearNever bend the spine of a bookAlways put books back where you found themBe as unobtrusive as possible - don't stop a bookseller from doing their jobLeave at least ten minutes before the shop closesNever stay longer than an hourDon't stand too near the till area - we don't like feeling as if we're being observedDon't smellNever ask any questions unless you seriously intend to buy a bookNever hinder a genuine customer from browsingThose are the ten golden rules in Steerforth Books. I understand that the dispossessed are naturally drawn to bookshops and who knows, one day I may join their ranks. But if you're going to frequent a bookshop without intending to buy anything, please observe the basic etiquette."},
{"title": "Celebrity memoirs", "date": "Wednesday, May 09, 2007", "text": "According to a report in Saturday's Guardian, Dawn French has been paid a £2,000,000 advance for her autobiography in the hope that it will become this year's Peter Kay. I haven't heard Century's justification for this ridiculous sum, but I suspect that the phrase much-loved comedienne appeared somewhere and a reminder that The Vicar of Dibley is the most successful comedy show ever. Apparently.I'm not a betting man, but I'm pretty sure that Random House have made a huge mistake. Who buys celebrity memoirs? Let's not beat about the bush - it's largely working-class people who are buying them as Christmas presents. And if you look at the best-selling celebrity memoirs of the last few years: Peter Kay, Shane Richie, Martine McCutcheon, Victoria Beckham and Jordan they all have one thing in common - they're written (or at least ghost-written) by working-class celebrities. In other words, chavs want to read about chavs.I would have thought that Dawn French is too middle-class to be a bestseller at Asda. I can't see readers warming to accounts of her exploits at the Central School of Speech and Drama. But on the other hand she is married to Britain's much-loved comedian Lenny Henry and if she give an honest warts and all account of their marriage (including the Australian blonde in the hotel), then tabloid serialisation is guaranteed.I could be wrong. If she writes a witty Alan Bennett-style memoir with chav-appeal then Random will have both the chattering and grunting classes covered, but it is a huge gamble and even if the book is a bestseller, how much money will they actually make? Poor old Ricky Tomlinson was virtually frog-marched around the country to sign the paperback version of his memoirs after the underwhelming performance of the hardback. This was sad enough, but as any bookseller will tell you, the paperback editions never sell In one shop I worked in the sales for Martine McCutcheon's autobigraphy were 450 in hardback. The following summer it came out in paperback and we sold six. Therefore we can safely conclude that whilst celebrity memoirs make great Christmas presents, nobody actually reads them (apart from the Bookseller to the Stars)January 2009 - Dawn French's autobiography went on to become one of the bestselling autobiographies of Christmas 2008, in spite of poor reviews. I stand corrected."},
{"title": "Is it me, or has British fiction lost the plot?", "date": "Sunday, May 06, 2007", "text": "Looking at my bookshelves, I'm struck by the fact that most of the novels I read are by European or American authors. I don't set out to ignore British writing, but there is something about it that turns me off. Out of the six novels I've read this year (yes, only six, but I'm reading more non-fiction this year), three of them were written by authors born in Barcelona, two were written by Americans and one was by a Frenchman.There are several reasons why this might be the case. First, I may have some innate prejudice against a lot of British writers because they write about a middle-class world that is alien to me. That statement would seem laughable to anyone who knew me as I seem the epitome of bourgeois values, but I grew up in a working class environment and still feel detached from people like Julian Barnes and William Boyd. Second, I think that there is a reluctance in British fiction to tackle big ideas and with the exception of David Mitchell, most attempts usually fall flat on their face. Third, it may simply be a case of feeling empathy with the 'otherness' of non-British writers.Of course it could be argued that there is no such thing as British writing (and I'm sure that many in Scotland would assert this view) but all I can say is that as a bookseller, when I look at the piles of novels by British authors, very few of them excite me. British fiction seems to aspire to capture the zeitgeist, but I want a novel that questions it and makes me look at the world in a different way, giving a voice to something I've felt but have been unable to articulate. And most of all, I want to finish the novel thinking 'Wow'. The last time an English writer did that to me was when I read Cloud Atlas."},
{"title": "Chichester Cathedral", "date": "Thursday, May 03, 2007", "text": "Every month I go to a regional managers' meeting in Chichester and although they can sometimes be heavy-going, this is compensated by the fact that we meet in a beautiful old coaching inn opposite the cathedral. As we sit and discuss the pressing issues of retail, the bells of the cathedral peel hourly, reminding us how ephemeral our concerns are.During last week's meeting I decided to have a look at the cathedral and was amazed to find it almost empty. There were no jostling tourists with cameras beeping and flashing and the only sound I could hear was some ethereal organ music.During the 1960s and 70s, the Dean of Chichester commissioned many works of contemporary art for the cathedral including sculptures by Henry Moore and music by Leonard Bernstein. He encountered some resistance from people who thought that contemporary art was incongruous in a 900-year-old cathedral and would detract from its atmosphere, but the Dean argued that every other piece of art in the cathedral was a product of its time. Four decades on, the modernist tapestries and stained-glass windows sit perfectly well with their older companions.The most striking thing I saw was the 12th-century tomb of a medieval knight and his wife. What is particularly moving about the tomb is the fact that they defied the convention of the time and insisted that instead of lying flat on their backs with one arm at each side, they would be shown holding hands.The wife is also leaning slightly towards her husband. A simple gesture, but an incredibly powerful one. Later I remembered that Philip Larkin had seen this tomb, known as the Arundel Tomb and was inspired to write this poem:   An Arundel Tomb         Side by side, their faces blurred,     The earl and countess lie in stone,     Their proper habits vaguely shown     As jointed armour, stiffened pleat,     And that faint hint of the absurd -     The little dogs under their feet.         Such plainness of the pre-baroque     Hardly involves the eye, until     It meets his left-hand gauntlet, still     Clasped empty in the other; and     One sees, with a sharp tender shock,     His hand withdrawn, holding her hand.         They would not think to lie so long.     Such faithfulness in effigy     Was just a detail friends would see:     A sculptor's sweet commissioned grace     Thrown off in helping to prolong     The Latin names around the base.         They would not guess how early in     Their supine stationary voyage     The air would change to soundless damage,     Turn the old tenantry away;     How soon succeeding eyes begin     To look, not read.  Rigidly, they         Persisted, linked, through lengths and         breadths     Of time.  Snow fell, undated.  Light     Each summer thronged the glass.  A bright     Litter of birdcalls strewed the same     Bone-riddled ground.  And up the paths     The endless altered people came,         Washing at their identity.     Now, helpless in the hollow of     An unarmorial age, a trough     Of smoke in slow suspended skeins     Above their scrap of history,     Only an attitude remains:         Time has transfigured them into     Untruth.  The stone fidelity     They hardly meant has come to be     Their final blazon, and to prove     Our almost-instinct almost true:     What will survive of us is love."},

Like many marriages it has had its ups and downs and one half of it fantasises about being single again, but it has endured. However, that could all change on May 3rd when the Scots vote for their devolved parliament. If, as some expect, the SNP become the majority party, this could be the first stage in the dissolution of the United Kingdom.If I was a Scot I would vote for independence, not for reasons of nationalism or anti-English sentiment, but simply because there is no reason why the Scots should not administer their own affairs.

{"title": "Galactica Redux", "date": "Monday, April 30, 2007", "text": "Last Saturday we visited a friend in London. She's good fun but intimidatingly intelligent. As a meat-eating, wine-drinking person who wasted their university education, I always feel slighted chastened by this teetotal, vegetarian with a PhD and wonder why she seems to enjoy our company when we're so different. But then I casually glanced at her DVD collection and saw Battlestar Galactica! She saw me looking and started extolling the merits of the series, praising the casting and the storylines. What is going on? She is the third non sci-fi person I've discovered enjoying Galactica.I decided to lend my DVD to someone at work who is one of the worst intellectual snobs you could ever meet (although I usually think he's right and everyone else is wrong). He loved it. There must be something good about the series although I still watch it alone with a mild feeling of shame, as if I'm viewing some sort of deviant pornography. Sci-fi isn't cool. You only have to look at the people that buy SF and fantasy novels.There is something about Battlestar Galactica that is attracting a mainstream audience who are prepared to ignore the absurd premise of the series and become fully engaged in the quest of the Twelve Colonies to find Earth. Apparently Galactica killed off the Star Trek Enterprise series and I can understand why. Battlstar Galactica isn't really a science fiction series - it's a dystopian post-9/11 drama which most people can relate to. Star Trek is good because it envisages a post-capitalist society in which racism and sexism are a thing of the past, but that also makes it quite dull at times and I can see why the politically correct world of the Enterprise has been superseded by the smoking, swearing, alcoholic crew of the Galactica."},

{"title": "Power to the people", "date": "Sunday, April 29, 2007", "text": "When I was 14, I remember seeing a report on the News at Ten about a village in Devon where, if you walked under a power line holding a flourescent tube, it suddenly lit up like a Star Wars light sabre. A group of around twenty locals were shown brandishing their tubes, waving them around like Jedi knights. Nobody seemed unduly alarmed. Indeed they all looked as if they were having great fun and the story was shown in the programme's light-hearted last item slot. I remember wondering what the power lines were doing to their bodies.A few years later Channel Four showed a superb programme which made a pretty compelling argument linking high-voltage power lines to cancer and a variety of other illnesses. There was strong evidence to suggest a higher incidence of childhood and adult leukemia in homes that were close to electricity pylons. I naively assumed that the programme would generate a lot of coverage in the media and prompt the public to demand Government action. Nothing happened. A few lone voices tried to push the issue of EMF radiation to the top of the public health agenda, but they were generally treated as a lunatic fringe. Perhaps it wasn't a 'sexy' enough subject.This week, two decades after the Channel Four programme, there has suddenly been a spate of articles about power lines and cancer clusters and it isn't just pylons that are the culprits now. Mobile phone masts have also been blamed for a variety of ills ranging from M.E to the disappearance of the sparrow and children have been advised not to have Wi-Fi laptops on their laps (presuming it's okay for me to continue irradiating my testicles).Obviously I am not an expert on this subject and there is no scientific consensus about EMF radiation and health problems. There is, however, a growing convergence of opinion in the same way that there was a few years ago in the environmental movement.If you don't know much about EMF radiation, there is a very general explanation here and a more detailed one here. If you're already concerned about this issue and want to protect yourself, there is an excellent (if slightly scary) book on how to make your home a safer place:I am only a layman and perhaps I'm emulating my grandmother, who wouldn't talk on the phone because she believed that she'd get an electric shock, but compare the world today to 100 years ago. In addition to all of the normal background radiation our bodies are being exposed to countless radio waves. There was much hilarity when, 25 years ago, a man in New York picked up a music station on the metal plate of his false teeth (Apparently it was The Four Seasons' 'Oh What a Night'), but today most of us are within range of a mobile phone mast and can here the bip bip bip noise on our radios when a mobile phone is finding a signal. As that isn't enough, in our homes we now have cordless digital phones, baby alarms  and wireless internet connections. What's it doing to us? Maybe nothing, but I'm not taking any chances."},

This is my favourite time of year, but recently I have started to have mixed feelings about the warm weather.In many ways I'm a very lucky bookseller, as I work in a seaside resort only a minute's walk from the beach, but there is a downside to this. As soon as the temperature hits the 20s, hordes of people are seized by the urge to feel the air on their skin. In Saint Tropez this wouldn't be a problem, but in Sussex the reality is rather unpalatable...And this is accompanied by the incessant flap flap of flip flops, which I find particularly offensive when worn by men. I don't know why. I don't like looking at people's feet at the best of times, but men's feet are especially unpleasant. Apparently some people derive some erotic pleasure from feet, which must be why some women adorn their toes with rings. Yuk. But worst of all, the other day a rather dull, middle-aged man came in my shop - he had a pot belly, short trousers and flip flops, which revealed a ring on one of his toes! I can just about understand some airhead backpacker wearing a toe ring because it's a bit tribal, but a short, plump man in his 40s?It's strange how the hot weather makes northern Europeans go a little mad. In really hot countries they do the sensible thing and cover up. You will never see Spaniards walking around town wearing thongs. Indeed, visit any southern European country and you'll learn how to look cool in the heat.I realise that I'm beginning to sound like Calvin. Next I'll be stopping people dancing and banning laughter. Although I'm not a religious person I was raised as a Christian and I sometimes wonder whether my distaste for self-adornment - tattoos, jewellery and attention-seeking clothing - stems from from my upbringing. I'm not consciously aware of feeling like that but nevertheless, I don't feel comfortable in my body and feel an irrational anger when I see people confidently displaying their rolls of fat in public. I'm of a relatively average weight and appearance, but I could never happily walk along a beach in Speedos. Perhaps I'm the one who has the problem?"},
{"title": "I'm all ears", "date": "Thursday, April 19, 2007", "text": "When you work with the general public you become aware of trends that you would probably never notice. For example I noticed that during the years 1994-97, most young, male, middle-class customers ended a transaction by saying 'Bye now', as if they were presenting a television programme for young children. Then it suddenly stopped for no discernible reason. Looking back, the only two events of 1997 were Tony Blair and Princess Diana. Perhaps they'd OD'd on touchyfeelyness and felt a need to get back in touch with their inner Conservative. I don't know.Another example is from about eight years ago, when several people I knew started saying 'Blahdiblah'. I'd never heard anyone say the phrase outside New York, but suddenly it became the default option for anyone who wanted to cut a sentence short. I waited patiently and sure enough, it suddenly disappeared without a trace after a couple of years.I also recall when AQI (Australian Questioning Intonation) suddenly appeared out of nowhere. One day my wife came home from work and everything she said sounded like a question.  It was bloody annoying, but she wasn't even aware of it. Somebody new had arrived in her office and their speech inflections passed around like a virus. I'm acutely aware of accents, probably because I grew-up in a working-class family and changed my accent in my teens, but my wife rarely notices how people speak.I remember Orwell writing about his days as a tramp and noting his surprise at how many fellow vagrants failed to notice his Eton accent. Orwell concluded that some people aren't attuned to oral idiosyncrasies and are more likely to judge by appearance.Several years ago I read something by Chomsky about this and it was a huge relief to find that I wasn't in some 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' scenario. Chomsky argued that language works like a virus, inveigling its way into the collective subconsciousness and I'm sure that anyone who works with the public and is attuned to accents will have noticed this phenomenon.If you haven't, you probably think I'm completely barmy."},
{"title": "Up on the Downs", "date": "Tuesday, April 17, 2007", "text": "When I lived in London I spent a whole summer walking the entire 100-mile length of the South Downs Way and used to dream of living in the countryside. Now that I've fulfilled my dream I rarely visit the Downs. I can cite a number of excuses, but I suspect that the main reason is because they're so near. I see them every day and know that if I walked out of the front door it would take me less than half an hour to join the route.It was the same when I lived in London. I rarely bothered to visit exhibitions or museums, but since I moved to Sussex I've become a member of the Tate Gallery and visit the centre of London more then I ever did when I lived in the suburbs.However, when the summer arrived two months early I decided to celebrate by going for a walk along the top of the Downs for a few miles, then take the path to Charlestone Farmhouse - home of the Bloomsbury Group - and take a guided tour, followed by a visit to the teashop. As the Osmonds would say, a little bit country and a little bit rock'n'roll.Sadly, I managed to get lost on one of the most clearly signposted routes in England and never found Charleston. I wandered aimlessly for two hours before giving up and eventually managed to find a pub where I rang for a taxi home.Ten minutes later the taxi arrived and I felt a great sense of relief until, two minutes into the journey, the driver started to have a fit. He started groaning and wrapped his right arm around his head, which rolled around as if it had been partially severed from the neck. I was terrified: 'Oh God, this is it. He's going to crash the car and I'm going to die and I never even saw Charleston.'Then he suddenly stopped and carried on as if nothing had happened.I should have asked him what the f*** was going on, but being English I was more concerned about seeming rude than asking him why he'd taken leave of his senses. I contemplated saying 'Er, actually this is where I live' when I saw a desolate lay-by. Anything, rather than being driven by a man in the throes of cardiac arrest. But I remained in the car and during the next few minutes, I gradually realised that the driver had something like Tourette's Syndrome.In hindsight he was a good driver and it was amazing how well he could drive with one hand on the wheel whilst looking over his left shoulder and groaning, but I couldn't help wondering if he was in the right job. Had his employer demonstrated an exemplary commitment to equal opportunities or were they unaware? I had mixed feelings. On the one hand I had nothing but admiration and sympathy for someone who suffered from a debilitating affliction but still managed to hold down a full-time job. But on the other hand, he scared the shit out of me and I really wondered if I was going to die. It would have helped if could he have warned me first."},
{"title": "Richard Yates", "date": "Saturday, April 14, 2007", "text": "Many thanks to John Self for recommending Richard Yates' Young Hearts Crying in his blog, which he rates even higher than Revolutionary Road. I have just finished it and although I'm not sure if it's superior to Revolutionary Road, it is certainly as good. I find it hard to believe that Yates languished in semi-obscurity for so long whilst writers like Updike and Roth were celebrated as pretenders to the Great American Novel, as he is every bit their equal.Yates' genius lies in his ability to capture that brief period that most of us go through in our late teens and early 20s, when we think that we're really going to become something, one day. His characters all lead dull, suburban lives but because they have artistic sensibilities they believe that they are in some way special. In Revolutionary Road the main characters - Frank and April Wheeler - live a comfortable life and regularly have amicable dinner parties with another couple who live nearby, but secretly despise their friends and think that they should be living in Paris, mixing with Left Bank  intellectuals. Yates' ability to depict people's pathetic (but entirely understandable) self-delusion and their gradual realisation that they are merely ordinary is done with the wisdom and compassion of a truly great writer.That afternoon she stood at the window to watch a straggling procession of the New Tonapac Playhouse people setting out on the long walk to the train station. And from this distance they all did look like kids - boys and girls from far and wide with their cheap hand luggage and Army duffel bags, brave entertainers who might travel for years before it occurred to them, or to most of them, that they weren't going anywhere.My fellow bookseller Mr Bedside Crow has recently posted a link on his fine blog to an author's website that is one of the best things I've ever seen on the internet. A collection of short stories by an unknown author normally makes booksellers' hearts sink, but Miranda July's  promotional website for her new book is just brilliant.Click on Ms July and I promise you won't regret it."},

Most crimes are committed by men, usually under the influence of alcohol. Very few of the offenders have jobs. Most of them have children but don't live with the mother and almost all of them have turned over a new leaf, if their solicitors are to be believed. It could make you very cynical, but in fact I generally find myself thinking 'There but for the grace of God...'The one big shock that I've had is the disparity between people's appearances and their age. This morning our first case involved a man who was accused of being drunk and disorderly. The defendant was called and a confused-looking man staggered into the court and took his place in the dock. His rough, dirty clothes and sunburned skin suggested that he was probably a vagrant and if I had to guess his age, I would have said that he was 56. I looked at his personal details and thought that I'd made a mistake. I checked the details again and then heard the man confirm that he was 38-years-old.Most of us are aware how diet and lifestyle can affect our health, but there is nothing like seeing the reality of of what homelessness and substance abuse does to people. A few weeks earlier I saw an elderly man with a white beard that made him look like Santa Claus. He was only 12 years older than me.I don't know why the mentally ill are still being processed through the prison system. It's over 20 years since Margaret Thatcher introduced her 'care in the community' policy which closed down the Victorian mental asylums and placed the mentally ill back in mainstream society. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but the end result is a disaster and the prison population has been swelled by the ranks of the mad. One frustrated prison officer said to me 'I joined this service to look after prisoners, not become a psychiatric nurse.'"},

In publishing terms this is a success, but after dividing this figure between the 60,000,000 people who live in Britain I worked out that only 0.017% of the population bought the book. Even if we allow for libraries and book sharing, the total number of readers for a universally-acclaimed novel by one of America's greatest writers amounts to less than 0.05% of everyone in Britain. Depressing.But before I succumb to despair I should mention that The Road has been picked as one of the Oprah Winfrey Book Club selection and McCarthy has agreed to give a rare interview. Whatever you think of the Oprah/Richard and Judy book clubs, they do at least achieve something that mortal booksellers can only dream of: they make ordinary people read literary fiction. The Richard and Judy book club has made some daring choices. I never thought that the average R&J viewer would appreciate the literary pyrotechnics of David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas, but I was delighted to find myself proved wrong when the novel was chosen as the readers' favourite.

If I have a mild virus I think nothing of retiring to bed for three days, during which time I'll suffer from intimations of mortality and become emotional when I hear birdsong (Goodbye dear world). If you're a mother, you could have terminal cancer and still be expected to do the school run up until the last minute.I was tempted to remind my wife of this rule two days ago when she limped home from school after sustaining a leg injury on a tree stump. When she revealed that it took place in a school playground, I told her that she was too old to do things like that and it was probably only a bruise, so here were some Ibruprofen tablets. The following morning she limped back to school (with a pushchair) and horrified the other mothers, who insisted that she should go to the local hospital. She did and was met by a nurse who told her that she needed at least two days in bed otherwise the wound could clot and gangrene could set in. Gangrene!My wife phoned me at work, mentioned the G word. I rushed home, naturally. Since then I have been looking after my sons whilst my wife lies upstairs like the invalid woman in Secret Army (later parodied in 'Allo 'Allo) barking orders from above.I have tried to be a new man like the father in the Athena poster, but have failed miserably. Although I am no stranger to cooking, changing nappies, bathing and 'creative play', I am totally useless at coping with the sheer unmitigated boredom of being with a small child all day. My youngest son is 16 months old and seems determined to die. Every minute he is either climbing something, trying to touch a hot oven, eating unsuitable objects or pulling the lid of the piano down on his fingers.If I had to do this every day I would probably become an alcoholic - I have certainly never craved alcohol as early in the day as today, when I opened a bottle of wine at teatime.    Meanwhile my wife has had a wonderful time lying in bed, reading a book for the first time in ages. Good for her (but I hope she gets better soon).I spend a lot of time with my sons, but it's always for a few hours at a time. I have been spared the relentless tedium of having to care for a child from morning until night, dressing, feeding, bathing, playing and nursing them. It's not all grim. He is a very sweet child with a great sense of fun, but I rarely feel equal to the task and struggle through the day. I am not the Athena man.As for the Athena poster, I've read that the man who conceived it died of AIDS. The photographer made so much money that he went off the edge and became a drug addict whilst the male model claims to have slept with over 3000 women. The baby received a paltry £32 for his efforts and is now a very normal teenager in Cyprus."},

A combination of equipment failure and human incompetence sent the reactor into partial meltdown and for days the authorities fought to control the situation.Weirdly, only a few days earlier a film was released that virtually predicted the Three Mile Island Incident. The China Syndrome, starring Jack Lemmon, Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas is one of the most underrated films of the 1970s - a relic of the days when Hollywood wasn't afraid to make political thrillers - and beyond the flares, dodgy hair and funky soundtrack, the film is particularly relevant today.The message of the China Syndrome is, in a nutshell, don't allow something as potentially lethal as nuclear power to be controlled by private enterprise. If you do, then corners will be cut and public health will be endangered. With a new generation of nuclear power stations on the agenda, we need a modern-day version of this film to scare the hell out of everyone.Is this fahrenheit or celsius?"},

She looked at me as if I was mad and I could see her point. But perhaps if she'd known more about the background to the photos and seen some of the pictures she might have changed her mind.Arnold Odermatt is an amateur photographer who served with the Swiss Police for 40 years and liked to combine his professional life with his private hobby, taking hundreds of photos, many of which are now widely acknowledged as masterpieces. Last year a retrospective was published entitled On Duty.There are some superb pictures of Volkswagens that have met an untimely end on Switzerland's mountainous roads, but the most striking photos are the ones that capture the mundanity of daily life.Not all of Odermatt's photos are reportage. Some, like the picture below, were staged as part of a recruitment drive when local elders expressed concern that the young had no interest in joining the police. It is these pictures in particular that have a surreal quality about them.And here we can see Odermatt reconstructing an accident scene that from earlier in his career:But  Odermatt's photography isn't all uniforms and mangled vehicles.

{"title": "Third time unlucky", "date": "Monday, March 19, 2007", "text": "I have just finished the third book in Zola's twenty-novel Rougon-Macquart sequence, Le Ventre de Paris. God it was boring. The plot was heavily influenced by Les Miserables, which was published ten years earlier. Like Victor Hugo's great novel, the main character is an escaped prisoner who is living under an assumed name and the story's dramatic tension rests heavily on the inevitable revelation of his true identity. However, in Zola's novel this plot plays a minor part in a story which is preoccupied with describing the daily life of a fish market. I don't want to do Zola a disservice. There are also some very evocative descriptions of cheese, but they don't make very exciting reading.As for the main character, Florent is no Jean Valjean. Sadly he is a bit of a prat who ultimately manages to be wrongfully arrested on two separate occasions. In a better novel this would be a tragedy, but in Le Ventre de Paris I found myself firmly on the side of the authorities and would have happily grassed him up.I always wondered why some novels by an author of Zola's stature hadn't been translated for over a century and now I have my answer. They aren't very good. However, I still intend to persevere because at its best the Rougon-Macquart novel sequence is a work of genius.He went from this...To this:By all accounts he was a fine actor and a generally good bloke who deserved better after his tenure as Mike Gambit in the New Avengers.

But as if that wasn't strange enough, I found perfectly sane non-geeky people recommending it to me. When two friends that I have the utmost respect for - one a lecturer at Sandhurst, the other an artist living in Helsinki - recommended Battlestar Galactica, my curiosity was aroused.I am now two-thirds of the way through the pilot episode and I can see what all the fuss is all about.

I used to drive round it every day on the way to the most soul-destroying job I've ever experienced - running a bookshop in Slough. The Slough branch of Ottakar's has seen more managers than Italy has changed prime ministers and at 17 months, I think I qualified as one of the longest serving. It may not sound a long time in the great scheme of things, but that 17 months felt like a life sentence and every day it was a challenge to remain positive in the face of overwhelming odds. Particularly as I had every reason to believe that I would be in Slough for years.What was wrong with Slough? Apart from the local population, who were less than endearing, the worst aspect of Slough was the sheer ugliness of the buildings. It felt as if some local by-law had been passed outlawing nature and I often found it hard to tell what season it was unless the weather was particularly extreme. Where I worked they had even outlawed the weather, entombing us in a cavernous, dimly-lit shopping centre whose main clientele consisted of gangs and bewildered-looking illegal immigrants who must have been regreting their decision to come to Britain. The only sign of nature was by my goods-in entrance where a tiny seed had taken root, fed by drips from the outflow pipe of our air-conditioning.One night I had a particularly vivid dream that I was in Chile - a place I had never been to. The ground was covered in purple blossom which formed a stunning contrast with the deep orange sky of the setting sun.   I don't normally pay any attention to dreams, but when I woke up I couldn't get the images out of my head. An hour later I was crawling along a very congested M25. It was a grey, drizzly, mid-February morning and the sight of concrete and traffic formed a stark contrast to my colourful dream. Something inside me snapped and I realised that I couldn't do this any more. When I got to work I picked up the phone, got my credit card out and booked a flight to Santiago.Two weeks later I was on the other side of the world. It was late summer in Chile and although I never saw orange skies and purple blossom, I did see a lot of beautiful and strange things. Some landscapes had a dream-like quality about them, juxtaposing the familiar and the unusual. For example I remember going past a field that could have been in Devon. It had lush green grass, friesian cows and brambly hedgerows, but in the background there was a huge, snow-capped volcano.I began my trip in Santiago, but after a couple of days took a train to the south of the country. After a long, overnight journey in a rackety old diesel I arrived at the Hotel Continental in Temuco. I knew nothing about the hotel and didn't have great expectations, but it turned out to be one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever visited, with a faded grandeur that made me feel as if I had travelled back in time to France in the 1920s. However the biggest surprise was discovering that my room used to be regularly occupied by Pablo Neruda. Here's a photo I took at the time.Chile seemed like a polar opposite to Slough. The country was beautiful, the people were nice and every day felt like a gift. Going there was an act of financial recklessness but it restored my sanity and made Slough bearable. Rarely a day goes past without me thinking about Chile and I have no doubt that one day I will return there.Ask me where I have beenand I'll tell you: 'Things keep on happening.'I must talk of the rubble that darkens the stones;of the river's duration, destroying itslef;I know only the things that the birds have abandoned,or the ocean behind me, or my sorrowing sister.Why the distinctions of place? Why should dayfollow day? Why must the blackness of nightime collect in our mouths. Why the dead?Pablo NerudaI found this piece of paper stuck to a telephone box near my shop.

{"title": "The storm clouds gather", "date": "Thursday, March 08, 2007", "text": "However bad things are for booksellers at moment, it's nowhere near as awful as the music industry. A combination of mp3 file sharing, DVD rentals and broadband movies-on-demand has already seen established retailers like Tower Records go to the wall and it's only a matter of time before others follow. Next week HMV will announce the results of a strategy review and I have no doubt that there are going to be some redundancies and closures.As HMV own Waterstone's, this is also going to have an impact on the book trade. Most branches of Waterstone's are profitable but there are a few white elephants, like the huge Picadilly branch and it will be hard for HMV to justify keeping these stores open in the face of a long-term downturn in sales. The big question is how far will sales decline before things botton out and how many shops will go from being profitable to loss-making?Waterstone's MD Gerry Johnson seems to think that digital downloading will also affect the book trade and that the effects will start to be felt within six months. I'm not convinced that it will be this soon, but there is no doubt that the sales of many reference books will soon begin to bypass the high street. I also agree with Johnson when he said that there was no sense in opening large 15,000 sq ft bookstores any more as even if they paid for themselves now, they won't in a few years.I'm surprised that Johnson's speech didn't get more publicity as it is one of the most radical statements that anyone in the book trade has ever made and the implications are enormous. Cynics might argue that Johnson's pessismism is simply paving the way for draconian measures, but I think he was just being realistic. We are buggered. At least, we're buggered if we want to carry on doing things the way we always have.In the past retailers wouldn't bat an eyelid if a new store made a loss for the first few years. Indeed they usually accurately budgeted for that loss in the belief that after a couple of years that shop would break into profit until, by the end of a decade, it had paid for itself several times over. They were usually right. Today, if Waterstone's opened a new branch they would not only have to be certain that it would be instantly profitable, but also be able to remain profitable after a 20% drop in sales. It's a tough old world out there.From a selfish point of view I have several worries. Number one: will I still have a job this time next year? Number two: how much harder will my work become? Number three: will Waterstone's survive or will they be swallowed-up by someone like Permira? Number four: what the hell would I do if I wasn't selling books? (actually I have several ideas)As far as bookselling is concerned, I think that the age of big, macho, superstores is over. Small is beautiful and the thing that differentiates a bookshop from an internet retailer is the passion and knowledge of ordinary booksellers. A few years ago it looked as if the age of the traditional high street bookshop was over. In the future we would drive to out-of-town shopping centres which would pull us in like a whale swallowing plankton, extract our money and spew us out the other end. However the future may end up being more like the past, and that is no bad thing."},

{"title": "Steerforth, J.P", "date": "Sunday, March 04, 2007", "text": "I had always imagined that magistrates were like characters in an Ealing comedy film. They would either be blustery, red-faced, retired colonels or bluestockings like Margaret Rutherford. If anyone had told me that I would end up becoming a magistrate I would have laughed, as I did four years ago when my wife first suggested the idea.     She had seen an article in a local paper inviting people of all ages and backgrounds to apply to become Justices of the Peace. At the time my job was fairly undemanding and my wife thought that I’d find the work interesting and, more importantly, I’d be good at it. I wasn’t so sure. Wasn’t I too young to have the necessary air of gravitas? However, the more I thought about it, the more the idea appealled and after a week I applied for an application form.     The form was quite detailed, asking questions about health, political views, Masonic connections and whether my nearest and dearest had any previous convictions. I also had to select three local people who had known me for more than two years to write a reference supporting my application. I sent the form off expecting to receive a polite rejection. Several months later I was invited for an interview.     Think of the worst job interview you’ve ever had, times it by ten and you’ll get some idea of how I performed in front of the selection panel. With job interviews you can prepare, but I had no idea what sort of questions I was going to be asked beyond the most obvious ones. I sat down in front of a panel of four people who proceeded to pull me to pieces, challenging everything I said to the point where I felt completely stupid. My answers seemed banal and inadequate and I left the room with my self-esteem in tatters. It served me right, I thought, for even daring to think to I could be a magistrate. I had been put firmly in my place.     Several weeks later I was invited for a second interview. I reluctantly went, expecting another humilating hour of being cross-examined, but this time I was given a piece of paper with six hypothetical cases, with multiple choice answers about what sentence I thought appropriate. One of the cases involved a man who was beating his wife and had previously served four weeks in prison for the same offence. The obvious answer seemed more prison and longer, but would it change anything? The case notes said that the man and his wife had three children and apart from these isolated incidents of domestic violence, they were a reasonably happy family. The best outcome was to keep the family together, but only if the violence could stop. I remmbered that there were anger management courses and decided to give him a suspended six month prison sentence with compulsory attendence at one of these courses. I hoped this was the right answer.     The second interview was quite different to the first and once I realised that I wasn’t going to be subject to a humiliating interogation I began to relax. In hindsight I now realise that the purpose of the first interview was to see how I performed under pressure. I can imagine that some people would have lost their temper at the rudeness of some of the questions, or perhaps let slip some sort of prejudice. I had passed by keeping my cool and not saying anything dreadful and now I had been invited back to demonstrate whether I possessed good judgement.  I passed the second interview and a year later, I swore an oath to the Queen in front of a judge. I found the words, which date back to the medieval period, particularly moving and felt privilegd to be part of something that began nine hundred years ago.     I am now a sitting magistrate and so far I haven’t come across anyone who resembles Margaret Rutherford. My colleagues are generally older than me, many of them work in the public sector and quite a few of them are frighteningly intelligent. In my more paranoid moments I wonder if I was only accepted because they needed to fill a quota for younger people, but I hope that in time I will become a decent magistrate.     During the last two months I have dealt with a variety of cases: assault, drunk driving, arson, theft, harrassment and assaulting a police officer. Some of the people appearing in the dock have been fairly unpleasant, but many have clearly been unlucky in life and their crimes have been the result of desperation or stupidity. As a magistrate my job is to protect the public, but I also want to see offenders have an opportunity to change their lives for the better.      I sit with two other magistrates one morning a fortnight, which is the most I can do with my full-time job in bookselling. One of the three magistrates is a chairman and does all of the talking whilst the two ‘wingers’ observe and take notes. If a case is fairly straightforward we will whisper to each other and agree on a sentence immediately, but if it is complicated then we will retire and discuss the evidence until we have reached a decision. Our job is not to know the law – we have a legal adviser to do that – but to make a judgement and ensure that justice is served.     Someone once said that if you invented a legal system from scratch, you probably wouldn’t have magistrates and I agree. It’s ridiculous that 97% of all legal cases are dealt with by unqualified amateurs. What’s even stranger is how well the system works. Every now and then senior governement officials make noises about replacing the magistracy with paid professionals, but the costs would be astronomical. I feel fairly confident that even if we aren’t around for another 900 years, the Justices of the Peace still have a role to play in the 21st century.     *As a footnote to the photo of Margaret Rutherford, whilst searching for a picture of her I discovered that her father was mentally ill and bashed his own father to death with a chamber pot!"},

A week or two later, at the Ottakar's annual managers' meeting, that shop would invariably win an award.I could never quite see the point of doing 'in-store' activities on World Book Day as the only people around seemed to be pensioners, the mentally ill and a few harrassed-looking mothers of small children. Why didn't we have WBD on a Saturday?Then, one year, I decided to take the mountain to Mohammed and set up a stall at a local school.  It was a revelation. Seeing children, some of whom had never bought a book before, clutching their free £1 vouchers and looking genuinely excited made me realise how important World Book Day is. Yes, it is an opportunity for bookshops and publishers to increase sales and the vouchers are a useful way of driving footfall through the shop, but the most important thing that we can do - if we really do care about reading - is to get out there and make a difference. It's no good just preaching to the converted.(So what am I doing today? Sitting on my backside at home, of course)Sadly, not everyone gets the point of World Book Day. Some parents try to use their children's vouchers to buy books for themselves and one charming lady with Elizabeth Duke hoop earrings tried to buy an £18 cookery book with 18 WBD vouchers. I have told staff that they mustn't accept the vouchers for grown-up books (unless a particularly precocious child wants to stretch themselves with War and Peace!)"},

Either way, he has an excellent blog and I only hope that he won't sustain any long-term damage from exposure to the vacuosity of celebrity memoirs.I'm on a slightly different quest. I'm attempting to read all 20 books in Zola's Rougon-Macquart sequence of novels. It's not as easy as it sounds. Fewer than half of the books exist in decent modern translations and the well-known novels only account for a third of the total. Why have the majority of the Rougon-Macquart novels languished in obscurity for so long?Amazingly, the only translation of the first novel The Fortune of the Rougons is the original Victorian one by Ernest Vizetelly. This may not be the best novel in the series, but has a pivotal role and I can't understand why no publisher has commissioned a modern translation. Vizetelly's translation is adequate, but to the modern reader it seems very stilted and I've recently discovered that he took huge liberties with the text.The second book was also ignored until recently then, like London buses, two came along at once. Arthur Goldhammer's translation of The Kill is superb and I was shocked at how explicit and saucy a novel published in the 1870s could be. So far so good.I am now on the third novel The Fat and the Thin and I'm struggling. The translation is okay but Zola is taking social realism to the point where nothing happens. I am on page 232 and the main protagonist is still ambling around the local fish market. There are some splendid descriptions of carp - if you like fish in literature, Zola's your man - but when is the story going to begin?I'm determined to not give up, as I know that the best is yet to come. But I am beginning to see why some of the Rougon-Macquart novels have taken a back seat."},

I'm not surprised - she's very attractive - but why did the poll have to be qualified? Why has natural beauty now been consigned to some sort of niche market?If you look at the middle shelf of the newsagent, i.e. all of those magazines that are almost soft porn but not quite - Nuts, Zoo, Loaded etc - all you can see is strange-looking girls with surgically-enhanced features. I think they look awful - at best chavvy, at worst more like transexuals - but we are told that this is what men want. Is this really true?Last year I had a Jordan signing. She looked quite odd - almost as small as a child, but with huge breasts and a strange tan. I liked her. She had no pretensions and seemed very bright, with a good sense of humour. What disturbed me was her fans, several of whom refered to her as a role model. It was particularly disturbing to see that some of Jordan's fans had dressed their seven-year-old daughters in sexy, Jordanesque gear. The underlying message is: don't worry about education and achievement, use your body to get what you want.That leads on to an item on the BBC News website today that children are being sexualised too early. Girls feel under pressure to be sexually attractive whilst boys apparently feel compelled to be interested, otherwise their peers call them 'gay'.I agree. During the last decade it feels as if the clock has been turned back and gender stereotyping is back in fashion. At first I embraced it, after the priggish thought-police of the 1980s who condemned Carry-On films. However, when popular culture encourages a perception of women as 'bitches' and 'whores', it's clear that the pendulum has swung too far.I often wonder if the sexualisation of the young is why the Burkha has become popular amongst young Muslims. It's easy to assume that they've all been radicalised by 9/11, but perhaps it's more a rejection of Western popular culture. I read an article yesterday that said that it was impossible to maintain a mulicultural 'inclusive' school because Muslims would want their children to opt out of activities like 'sexy dancing'. This begs the question, why would schoolchildren being doing sexy dancing in the first place?Our society  commodifies sexual stereotypes like Jodie Marsh, but is that really what men want? I always take great comfort from the fact that in a poll of men in several countries, they said that the sexiest woman in the world was Diana Rigg when she played Emma Peel - an intelligent, independent, silicone-free woman."},

The rest of my stuff is either in storage or being pecked at by disappointed seagulls at the local rubbish dump.However, there have been a few gems. Some of them I had forgotten about whilst a few were completely new to me, including this photograph (dated 1893) which I found in a box belonging to my wife's grandmother Lilian.As soon as I saw this picture I had to post it. I have no idea who these people are and as I was driving home in my car yesterday, I thought 'I must try and ask Lilian who they are.' Lilian is now 99 and has lost most of her marbles to the point where she genuinely believes that she plays tennis every morning, but she has lucid moments and old people are generally good at remembering the distant past. She is the only person who might know. I resolved to ask her as soon as possible, otherwise the mystery will remain unsolved.A few minutes later I arrived home. As I shut the door behind me, my wife looked up at me and said 'Nan's died.'"},
{"title": "Betrayal", "date": "Saturday, February 17, 2007", "text": "Anyone who has read Elizabeth Gaskell will know how grim life was in 19th century Manchester. Indeed the whole area that has now become the conurbation of Greater Manchester had some of the worst housing and working conditions in the world, so it was inevitable that the English socialist movement would start here rather than London.150 years on, the heirs of the Rochdale Pioneers are in power. I remember the night of the 1997 election, almost ten years ago, when 18 years of Conservative rule finally came to an end. The following morning most people were on a high. We believed that we had ushered in a new era that, like the Labour government of 1945-51, would transform society and bring morality back into politics. How wrong we were.Tony Blair's Labour government has failed in so many ways - the most conspicuous example being Iraq - but for me the most symbolic act has been the decision to make Manchester the site of Britain's first 'supercasino'. The men and women who fought so hard to improve the conditions of the working class must be turning in their graves to discover that the party that they founded, is trying to regenerate inner city Manchester by encouraging the building of casinos.There has been a lot of coverage in the news about this, but the angle has mainly been about whether it should have been Liverpool or Manchester. Very few people have actually questioned the whole notion of encouraging gambling, which generally makes the poor even poorer.Perhaps I'm being prejudiced. My family have always been very anti-gambling because three generations ago my great-grandfathers were compulsive gamblers and ensured that their children grew up in poverty. When they had a bad night they returned home drunk, beat their wives up and took the housekeeping money. Unsurprisingly, my grandparents didn't want to emulate the older generation.However, prejudice aside, it surely can't be right that a government whose origins lie in the Socialist movement is now seeking to improve social conditions in Manchester by encouraging gambling."},

I don't know where this place is, but I want to go there.It's the half term week - loved by teachers, hated by parents. I normally try and take a few days off to prevent my wife from entering a psychotic episode, but I wasn't able to this time and the house looks as if it has been ransacked by enemy soldiers.However I did get today off and I decided - perhaps foolishly - that we should all go to London and see the William Powell Frith exhibition at the Guildhall. I should explain at this point that I wouldn't normally regard an art exhibition as a good day out for two small boys, but my wife is related to W.P. Frith and as this is the first time his paintings have been displayed together for 50 years, we had to go. I had no illusions about the day. I knew that my one-year-old would probably spend the entire journey screaming and that my seven-year-old would compare the paintings unfavourably to Pokemon, but not many people have a relative who was a best friend of Charles Dickens.I planned the journey like a military operation and even found myself using the 24-hour clock. It all started very well. There was no screaming, the trains ran on time and we managed to find a station near the Guildhall. In London I had plotted  a route that would give us time to visit St Paul's Cathedral as I thought it would be good for my oldest son to see a really big building. Sadly, St Paul's was a huge disappointment, as it now costs £9.50 per person! We didn't go in.The exhibition was very good. W.P.Frith had no illusions about his status in the great scheme of things, writing that 'I am not a great artist, but I am a very successful one' and his paintings belong to the 'So good, it's almost like a photograph' school of art. In other words, art for Daily Mail readers.Frith's success was phenomenal - when his painting of Ramsgate Sands was originally displayed, the galley's curators had to erect barriers to keep the crowds at bay - and his celebrity status during the Victorian age is probably one of the reasons why he has been neglected ever since. The famous paintings like Derby Day are displayed at the Tate, but many normlly lie in dark, unvisited vaults. This is a pity because although Frith's artistic merit may not be on a par with some of his contemporaries, anyone who wants to understand Victorian England must look at his paintings.In its own way, Derby Day is a masterpiece because it encapsulates the different social stratas of Victorian society. It may not be great art, but it is good documentary. In the extreme left hand of the picture we can see a con artist trying to entice people to gamble. A local farmer in a rough smock starts to move forward whilst his wife pleads with him not to go. Next to the con artist, a folorn young man empties out his pockets after losing his money at the races. In the centre of the picture a man sits in a carriage serving champagne to three young women, who might be prostitues, whilst further right a bored-looking man leans against a carrige with his back to the unhappy woman who is probably his mistress. Rothko it ain't, but there should be room for W.P.Frith's work in our galleries."},
{"title": "Author tours", "date": "Wednesday, February 14, 2007", "text": "If you're a publisher, what do you do if an author you've invested a lot of money in fails to come up with the goods? At the moment there seem to be three options:Drop themInvest more money (rejacket the backlist and advertise)Make them go on a tourDuring the last couple of years the third option seems to have become increasingly popular. Publishers reason that before they go to the time and expense of relaunching an author whose sales are flagging, it makes sense to see whether putting a few signed copies at the front of the shop makes any difference.I have had several phone calls recently from slightly desperate-sounding publishers who want to bring their author to my shop: 'No, it's not a proper signing session...he'll just turn up and sign a few books for you off the shop floor. Do you have enough stock?' Of course I never do, so I end up having to order at least three copies of each backlist title.A few weeks later the author arrives. They are always very pleasant and I like to think that there is an unspoken acknowledgement that I have probably never read their books. The author is usually accompanied by a terrifying publicity woman who makes me feel as if I'm a naughty little boy, but not in a nice way.I hate meeting authors. If I love their books I feel like some dumbstruck teenage fan and just stand grinning at them in a slightly moronic manner. If I haven't read their books I feel guilty. In fact the only authors I like meeting are the ones whose books I can't stand and sometimes I sense that they like meeting someone who is completely indifferent to their work and won't ask them why Throngard seized the Sword of P'toth in Book Seven.When I'm nervous I make jokes that seem mildly amusing at the time, but usually go down like a lead balloon. For example, when Peter James asked me why we had such a good turnout for his signing session I said 'Oh that's because they thought it was P.D.James.' I thought it was funny, he didn't.However when an author event goes well I feel on a high. I love standing at the door at the end of the evening and talking to the customers as they leave. I can only listen to so many people thanking me for a lovely evening before my resistance crumbles and I feel like James Stewart at the end of It's a Wonderful Life.I haven't been blogging much recently as I haven't had that much to say. I don't know why. I checked my statistics the other day and the number of visitors is slowly dwindling, understandably. However, yesterday I suddenly had a huge number of hits and I have no idea why. What magic word did I write to attract so many people?I've just visited Debi Alper's blog and she has a link to this thought-provoking posting. I responded by adding a link of my own to this this article in the Independent by Claudia Winkleman, who writes a weekly humorous, zeitgeisty, girl-about-town column. I've read plenty of articles about global poverty, but somehow this one got under my skin. It's short. Read it and you'll see what I mean."},
{"title": "Manga", "date": "Tuesday, February 13, 2007", "text": "Someone from PanMacmillan told me that their Manga list now generates more money than their fiction and crime lists put together. I'm not surprised. Last year we held a Manga evening and the shop was packed with people that my 19-year-old children's bookseller rather harshly described as 'fat losers.' They weren't all fat. Indeed, many were extremely skinny and some of the boys looked slightly comical in their Keanu Reaves-style Matrix coats.Personally I find Manga rather strange and creepy, but as a bookseller I can't get enough of it. As a genre it seems fairly internet-proof, as part of the pleasure of buying it seems to be meeting up in the shop with other Manga readers and hanging out together. Also, with such a large range of titles, there isn't much danger of Tesco or Asda muscling-in on the act. Best of all, Manga novels don't take long to read so people often buy several at a time.I just wish I understood more about Manga (without having to go through the actual tedium of reading about it) as I don't know how spot-on my range is. I suppose I could talk to a Manga fan next time they buy a book. 'Hello young man. I used to be a big fan of comics - loved the Beezer and Topper, but I need to gem-up on this new Manga thing...'"},

Sadly they never experienced love in zero gravity together. Novak's mission was last July whilst Oefelein's was a few weeks ago. However, according to Nowak they developed an association that was 'more than a working relationship but less than a romantic relationship'.Unfortunately for mother of three Nowak, she had a rival called Coleen. When Novak discovered that Coleen was flying to Florida to visit Oefelein, she jumped in her car and drove the 1000 miles from Houston to Florida so that she could intercept Coleen at the airport. When I say jumped, it wasn't actually that spontaneous. In fact Nowak found time to equip herself with a wig, dark glasses, trench coat and pepper spray. But most bizarrely of all, she wore a nappy.Nowak was so determined to reach Florida in time to confront her nemesis that she wore a nappy to avoid loo breaks.

{"title": "Emergency on Planet Earth", "date": "Friday, February 02, 2007", "text": "At last, there seems to be a consensus on global warming. The debate is no longer between the believers and sceptics, but between those who believe that there is still time to act and those who are convinced that we're buggered. In all of this not one person has mentioned Jamiroquai, who warned us fourteen years ago that there was an Emergency on Planet Earth.Why didn't we listen to him? Was it the hats, the eco-unfriendly fast cars or the assaults on journalists that undermined his credentials?On a serious note, does anyone remember the 1988 elections for the European Parliament when the environment was such a hot topic that the Greens beat the Liberals into 4th place? I remember lots of people wearing t-shirts with pseudo-ethnic drawings and insipid mottos like Save the Rainforest and when I started in bookselling, we had a separate section for environmental books. What happened?As far as I can remember a few politicians paid lip-service to green issues whilst the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of apartheid convinced a lot of people that the bad days were over. I can't prove this, but I remember how the t-shirts became rarer and we ended up scrapping our Ecology sections due to a lack in demand.I'm worried that this is going to happen again.(Warning: soapbox alert!)If we're going to survive the challenges that lie ahead we need to take radical action now. First and foremost we need to address the issue of overpopulation before nature decides to do it for us. Second, we need to create a new infrastructure for transport, power generation and public utilities that will be carbon neutral and able to withstand extreme weather conditions. Third, we need to develop a sense of shared responsibility both on a local and global level. It is not enough to expect Brazil to unilaterally halt deforestation without our help in providing the economic support for those people who will be deprived of an income as a resultThere is no reason why we all have to don hair shirts and lead utterly miserble lives to achieve this. Technology has already come up with many solutions: business trips can be replaced by video-conferencing, hydrogen fuel cells can replace petrol and solar panels will soon be efficient enough to give most homes the ability to generate some of their own power. Even the thorny issue of population can be tackled painlessly, in this country at least, if we give tax incentives for small families and rely on the increasing number of childless households to encourage negative population growth.The answers are all there. I'm just worried that our politicians will make a few token gestures that will appease the public to the point where the big issues disappear from the agenda. It happened nearly twenty years ago and there's no reason why it couldn't again. However, perhaps the environment will remain in the forefront of people's minds for one good reason: the weather has changed.Today I went for a walk in the countryside and saw wild flowers, two bumblebees and some daffodils almost in flower. It was lovely, but very strange. Meanwhile my fireplace remains full of unburned logs, as it has never been cold enough to have to light a fire. As I wheeled my 15-months-old son in his pushchair this afternoon, I couldn't help wondering what sort of a future he is going to have."},

{"title": "A remarkable life", "date": "Tuesday, January 30, 2007", "text": "I have read many biographies and unless the subject's life is particularly tragic, I am impressed by what a rich life they've led compared to my own humdrum existence. However, only one person has inspired me to the point where I would swap places with them: the lesbian speedboat champion Marion 'Joe' Carstairs.During her youth Carstairs was famous as  the fastest female speedboat racer in the world but by the time she died  in 1993, at the age of 93, she was almost forgotten. Luckily, the Daily Telegraph newspaper decided to include a small obituary and asked one of its writers - Kate Summerscale - to prepare one. When Summerscale began her research she soon realised that she was dealing with a remarkable individual and had a book in the making.Carstairs led an extraordinary life. After becoming the fastest woman on water she went on to buy an island in the Bahamas and ruled it as a benevolent despot, entertaining the great and the good of Hollywood and Europe whilst enjoying a string of lovers that included Marlene Dietrich.One of the most appealling things about Carstairs was her penchant for practical jokes. Her sister was a professional golfer and Carstairs once travelled halfway across the world so that she could hide in a bush by the last hole and jump out shouting 'Boo!' just as her sister was taking the crucial final shot.However, her finest joke was when she persuaded some islanders to shine up their faces, strip down to their shorts and drum menancingly outside her house as she entertained guests one evening. 'The Blacks are going to kill us all. Pansies first, women last' she warned her guests and watched with delight as they fled upstairs and cowered in the bedrooms. With a great theatrical flourish she marched outside with a shotgun and let off a few shots. The drumming subsided and Carstairs told her guests 'I think it's going to be alright now.'As Kate Summerscale found out, Joe Carstairs' rich and varied life cannot be summed-up in a few paragraphs and I am not going to try and do that here, particularly when you can follow this link to an excellent article written by Summerscale herself. Even better, you could read Summerscale's excellent short biography of Carstairs, The Queen of Whale Cay, which is a fitting tribute to a genuine eccentric with an exhilarating zest for living."},

I have never read a Fantasy novel, unless you include The Hobbit. I once listened to a BBC radio dramatisation of Lord of the Rings that was so good I felt that it absolved me from having to read the book. But apart from that, nothing.I have vaguely tried, on a couple of occasions, to see what it was about these novels that inspired so much passion in their readers. However several things put me off, not least the people who buy them. Fantasy fans have always been the bain of my life as a bookseller as they have an uncanny ability to appear at the most inconvenient time of the day with an enquiry about when  the next book in the Wheel of Time/Shannara/Otherworld/Pern/Mallorean series was coming out. This was always annoying, but today it's unforgiveable. I know these people spend at least four hours a day on the internet and have access to dozens of author websites and online fanzines, so why are they still coming in at 5.27 pm and asking for a list of all the books featuring orcs?I've been trying to discover the secret of the Fantasy genre, but I've failed. All I can deduce is the following:If you're a male writer, you should call yourself TerryAlways have a map at the front of the book, usually featuring a 'Western Sea' and some mountains in the eastUse as many superfluous apostrophes as possible when naming people. I'm not sure why P'lomia and D'garian should be considered attractive names. I blame T'pauWrite in a portentous, over-written style that echoes Tolkein and lends a certain gravitas to your tale of a humble blacksmith who finds himself being sent on an vital mission to destroy a dark lordAlways have a quest. No quest, no storyNever mind the quality, feel the widthNever write a single novel. All self-respecting fantasy writers have at least five in their seriesThe front cover should, if possible, feature a white horseI read a very interesting article (which I've sadly lost) which deconstructed Fantasy fiction and its appeal to a largely male readership. The gist of it was that it tapped into a cultural subconsciousness about the myth of Lyoness/Atlantis (hence the prevelence of a western sea in the maps)  and appealed to men who felt psychologically castrated by the post-industrial consumer society.Shall I mention this to the next person who buys a David Eddings novel?"},

However it now transpires that he is a right-wing, Christian fundamentalist who will probably use the evening as a platform for his views. Looking back on my meeting with him, he did say something along the lines of 'My friends didn't sacrifice their lives for all this filth and depravity.'I should have taken the hint.If he sticks to talking about firing rockets at Nazis then all well and good. What I don't want is a roomful of people who have turned up to listen to a war hero recount his exploits, only to be told that they live in the last days of Sodom.(NB - Since writing the above, I have met Steve Stevens several times and he is never less than charming, so I should take hearsay with a pinch of salt)Several years ago I booked an author who wrote books about self-defence and was notorious as the sort of man who could (and would) break someone's neck with his little finger. The shop filled up with shaven-headed, neckless men in their twenties and thirties who all seemed quite excited by the prospect of comparing notes about the best way to beat someone senseless.The author arrived and after greeting the audience with a convivial 'Alright lads?' began his talk with the following sentence:'I know that a lot of you have come here because you want to hear me talk about fighting, but I've become a Buddhist and turned my back on violence. Self-defence is not about fighting, but avoiding confrontation...'You could cut the atmosphere with a knife. The crowd were turning ugly and it was only when the author started listing some of the 'terrible' things he did before he converted to Buddhism that the mood improved. The talk finished with something along the lines of 'I don't fight any more, but I could still 'ave you if I wanted to.'"},
{"title": "Beware of the headhunter!", "date": "Monday, January 22, 2007", "text": "A few weeks ago I was talking to someone from one of the big five publishers and we got onto the subject of central scale-outs, where deals are made in smoke-filled rooms between publishers and bookselling chains. It's a simple enough process. We, the booksellers, agree to buy 2000 copies of a book in return for a better discount of 57% instead of the usual 48%. We use this extra margin to discount the selling price resulting in higher sales. Everyone's happy, except those authors whose books haven't been promoted.It should be a fairly amicable process, but a few years ago the publisher had to deal with a buyer who was extremely difficult to work with. The buyer was generally disliked by most of the people she dealt with, but because she was a 'figure' in the book trade she was regarded as untouchable.The publisher came up with a novel solution: they decide to poach her. The buyer was given an offer she couldn't refuse and happily jumped ship. Six months later they made her redundant. She couldn't go back into book retailing and no publisher would employ someone with her reputation, so that was the end of that.This tactic was so successful that it was almost employed on at least one other occasion."},
{"title": "Are you local?", "date": "Sunday, January 21, 2007", "text": "I was in my office today doing something incredibly boring with an Excel spreadsheet when the phone rang. It was someone on the shop floor. 'There's a local author who wants to see you.'My heart sank.I prepared myself for the usual routine in which I try to politely explain that self-published poetry doesn't sell and no, a signing session wouldn't be a good idea unless they like sitting at a table for an hour being ignored by customers.The other problem I have with local authors is that many of them have stretched the dictionary defintion of 'local' to include the following categories:They live 27 miles away but occasionally shop hereThey live in Scotland, but their daughter-in-law attended a local school in 1974They have a friend who used to live hereThey are local, but to somewhere elseAnd why do they always turn up on the busiest day of the week, expecting me to drop whatever I'm doing and listen to them ramble on for half an hour about their anthology of poems about Tenerife? By now I was getting annoyed, threw my spreadsheet down and marched onto the shop floor ready for battle.At the counter stood a man who was so old that his spine had contracted to a height that made him resemble a hobbit. His frail, purple-skinned hands were slowly shuffling some papers that he had produced from a bag and although I was standing right next to him, he seemed unaware of my presence. I introduced myself and shook his hand, trying to give him the sort of firm handshake that men of his generation like, without inflicting any damage.He had written a book called Beaufighter Over the Balkans recounting his experiences as a fighter pilot during World War Two. I knew nothing about the Bristol Beaufighter and was fascinated to hear how he was sent on missions to destroy strategic buildings and ships, most of which required him to fly at a dangerously low altitude so that he could fire his rockets with a reasonable degree of accuracy. In addition to flying fast and low, he had to take photos to prove that he'd hit his targets and he showed me examples of his work. One picture showed a Nazi headquarters before and after he'd fired rockets at it. Another showed an attack on German shipping.Unlike most of his colleagues he survived the war and went on to play a crucial role in the Berlin airlift of 1948. He slammed the book shut and asked if I'd be interested in doing a signing. I had a better idea - how about a talk? If anyone had a story to tell he did. He seemed pleased to be asked and next month, if he's still alive, Steve Stevens DFC will be speaking at my shop.I have tried to find a photo of Steve Stevens, but it wasn't easy. First I found this...For all his strutting, male posture, if this Steve Stevens was involved in any action he'd probably start cryingThis Steve Stevens does look like he's seen a bit of action, but unless he's done a Michael Jackson, I think that my Steve Stevens was always white...Steve Stevens: The Rotary Club Years.

{"title": "Two novels", "date": "Friday, January 19, 2007", "text": "I've just read two novels in rapid succession (by my standards, if not Dovegreyreader's). The first was a proof copy that I found under a pile of boxes in my loft. The second was discovered at the Brighton branch of Waterstone's, which has the best fiction table I've ever seen, full of authors I've never heard of.By sheer co-incidence, both novels are by Barcelonan authors who were born in 1965 and they are both published by Canongate.The first novel is The Best Thing That Can Happen to a Croissant by Pablo Tusset. I'm normally quite a slow reader, averaging around 40 pages a day, however I found this novel so compelling that I managed the last 140 pages in under two hours. It's a weird book that starts like a mixture of Murakami and John Kennedy Toole and ends up like a more intelligent version of the Da Vinci Code (it was written before Dan Brown's book) with Robert Langdon played by Pete Doherty. But ultimately this is a book with a very strong voice of its own and I liked the author's dry, witty narrative style.As you can see, the author is obviously keen on croissants and it's intriguing that his main character is an overweight man in his thirties called Pablo, who likes drinking, smoking dope and visiting prostitutes. Is this novel semi-autobiographical or is Pablo an alter-ego? The only biographical information I can find out about Tusset is that he abandoned a successful career as a literary critic to become a writer. He made the right decision and this, his first novel, received rave reviews when it was published in Spain. Here is an extract:An inordinately loud clap of thunder roused me from my nap: brrrrrrrrrrrrm, just as I was dreaming about a bunch of treacherous creatures that possesed the singular ability to sink their little legs into the earth, take root there and survive indefinitely in vegeatble form. They even had a name: borzogs, they were called, a strange hybrid between nettle and elf. You could walk among them and not suspect a thing and then suddenly - bam! - they would come alive...and take hungry bites out of your legs.I enjoyed Tusset's novel so much that I felt that anything similar would pale by comparison, so for my next book I chose something completely different: a story set in 1916 on a tiny sub-Antarctic island. I knew nothing about book or its author, but when I spotted it on a table in Waterstone's I was intrigued by the blurb. I had no idea that its author was born in the same year and lived in the same city as Tusset.Cold Skin begins conventionally enough with a prose style that could have easily have been written 100 years ago. In 1916 a young man arrives by ship at a remote island in the South Atlantic to replace the incumbent weather inspector, but on reaching the small building that will be his home for a year the ship's crew find it abandoned, with half-broken furniture strewn across the floor.  The man and the ship's captain cross the small, one-mile-long island to the only other building - a lighthouse - where they find a man hiding under the bedclothes. The captain questions the stranger, but is unable to get any sense out of him and tries, unsuccessfully, to persuade the young man to return to the ship.One of the most powerful scenes in the book features the young man standing on the beach, watching the ship disappear beyond the horizon, knowing that his decision is irrevocable. He returns to his new home and prepares to spend his first night reading one of his vast collection of books, but as he settles done he hears a blood-curdling noise...I  started to speculate about the author's influences:  definitely H.G.Wells, possibly Poe, M.R.James and Conrad. However my seven-year-old son was nearer the mark when he said that the plot sounded like a computer game he plays called Alien Shooter. He was right. I'd played the game too and although there were no aliens in Cold Skin,  the basic premise was exactly the same.  I wonder if the author - Albert Sanchez Pinol - is an Alien Shooter fan? And to complete the coincidences, Cold Skin features creatures who are remarkably like Tusset's borzogs."},

{"title": "Fear", "date": "Wednesday, January 10, 2007", "text": "Today I found a newspaper cutting entitled 13 fascinating phobias. Some of them were perfectly understandable, like Peniaphobia, the fear of poverty and Ergophobia, the fear of work. However there were a few that were completely bizarre. For example, Linonophobia, the fear of string, Chromophobia, the fear of colour and my favourite, Phobophbia, the fear of fear.Another one of the list is also probably bizarre, but it is one that I suffer from - Apeirophobia, the fear of infinity. It's not a major problem. I don't wake up in cold sweats thinking about infinity, but it does bother me and very few days go past when I don't dwell on the subject.But my main phobia is one that, as far as I know, doesn't even have a name - the fear of chalk (calciphobia?). Like many people I hate the sound of a chalk squeaking on a blackboard, but my phobia is based on the absorbency of chalk and its dryness. When I go to the local beach I feel distinctly uncomfortable being so close to the towering chalk cliffs. Ugh! I don't even like writing about it. Luckily there are very few occasions these days when I come across a piece of chalk.I have no idea how this bizarre phobia originated. Do you have any secret fears that you want to share?"},

{"title": "Technology and personal identity", "date": "Saturday, January 06, 2007", "text": "Like many children born since the mid-80s, my sons lives have been captured on video camera and I have a collection of tapes that is so large, I would need to take a week's holiday to watch them. As much as I love my boys the tapes are, frankly, extremely boring. I can't bear to watch them and my oldest son starts yawning and fidgeting within five minutes. Only my wife seems immune from the tedium of rewatching the school nativity play or a five-minute sequence of my son eating a bowl of pasta.Last year I decided to do something about it, took that week off work and edited 20 hours' worth of video tape down to a handful of short DVDs. As a result, we all enjoy reliving some of the happier moments from the past and my eldest son seems fascinated by them. However, as I watch him watching the video footage, I wonder what effect this will have on his memory.In the natural order of things, we are supposed to forget the first five or six years of our lives, apart from a few flashes of memory. That sense of one's life as a narrative only develops in response to an accumulation of memories, which is why children possess the enviable ability to live in the present. However, many of today's children never go through the natural process of forgeting their past because they are continually reviewing it. I wonder what effect this on an individual's psyche?I have tried Googling this question as I'm sure that there must have been some research done on the subject, but I haven't had any success.If we go back further, beyond cine films, photographs and tape recordings, it was normal for people to forget most of their own history. Only the literate could keep a journal and portraits were limited to the priviliged few. Was this a bad thing? It is natural to want to preserve the past because it gives perspective and meaning to our lives, and the comforts of the past can counterbalance the uncertainties of the future, but would it be better if we just lived for the moment?This theme has been explored by artists and many people will remember Michael Landy's 'Break Down' installation in which he occupied the ground floor of the former C&A in Oxford Street and systematically destroyed all of his 7000 possessions as a protest against the consumer society. Nothing was spared. By the end of the 14-day exhibition, Landy owned nothing except the boiler suit he stood in.I'd be interested to know how he lives now. Did he pop down to Argos, pick up a catalogue and replenish his worldly goods or has he maintained his stance against materialism?But that's a digession from a train of thought that began with home videos. If you're still reading, thank you for not drifting off. If you have any thoughts on this matter I'd be interested to hear them."},

The real date is June 1st, but I just couldn't wait. It is hard to believe that this album was released such a long time ago, particularly when it sounds so fresh and innovative compared to many of today's bands. But this post isn't a homage to Sergeant Pepper, as I have to confess that I think it doesn't deserve its status as the greatest rock album of all time.Sergeant Pepper has some fantastic songs: A Day in the Life, She's Leaving Home, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and A Little Help From My Friends, but let's not forget Good Morning Good Morning, Lovely Rita or indeed the title track, which have B-side written all over them. I'd sooner have the White Album which, with the exception of the appalling Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, is a masterpiece. And what about Revolver?Come June, middle-aged music journalists will be in clover writing about Sergeant Pepper in 1967 and the Sex Pistols in 1977. (What happened in 1987? Oh yes, Rick Astley) Indeed, if I look into my crystal ball, the fog is lifting and I can see a bookshop table with a selection of retrospectives by some of our finest rock journalists (at this point I must confess to having an irrational prejudice against rock journalists). If I look further into the future I can see a stock room with a lot of books waiting to go back to the publisher.So if Sergeant Pepper isn't the greatest album of all time, what is? I love the Beatles, but my choice would be Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys. Oddly enough, quite a lot of rock journalists agree with me."},

In the world before children it didn't matter, but hangovers aren't compatible with looking after a manic seven-year-old and a screaming infant.The rest of the day followed the usual pattern: painkillers in the morning, a large late breakfast and a wholesome walk in the countryside as an act of attonement for the previous evening's excesses.It was a beautiful day, but something felt wrong. The Independent newspaper had a headline screaming about climate change and the evidence seemed to be in front of our eyes - a field full of daisies. Apparently crocus bulbs have flowered, lambs have been born and plants that should have died in early November are still in bloom. It's all very strange. Also, the ground, which should have been 'deep and crisp and even' was so wet and muddy that my friend Kathryn and I slipped while climbing up a slope.I read very little last year. I don't know why. Perhaps the addition of a screaming insomniac baby didn't help or maybe I wasted too much time blogging, but this year I will devote more time to reading and less to drinking wine and surfing the internet. I will never achieve Dovegreyreader's ability to read nine Dickens novels in one day whilst quilting and healing the sick at the same time, neither will I manage Scott Pack's 137 books in one year. I am a slow reader. But if I can manage a book every week or so, it will be an improvement on the pitiful handful that I read in 2006.In the meantime, have a very happy, healthy and prosperous new year."},
{"title": "My Christmas present to myself", "date": "Tuesday, December 26, 2006", "text": "I have just bought an original illustration by Martin Aitchison from one of the Peter and Jane Ladybird reading scheme books. I had slight misgivings about spending £400 on an picture from a children's book, as bookselling is not the most lucrative of occupations. However when I opened the package and saw the original, my doubts immediately vanished. If you didn't grow up with these books, you're probably wondering what is so special about these workmanlike depictions of everyday family life around 30-40 years ago? The obvious answer is nostalgia, but I think there's more to it then that. There is something poignant, even tragic, in Martin Aitchison's paintings and whilst I don't think he laboured to create a subtext,  there is one.These scenes from an idyllic childhood are so powerful because they don't just capture a lost time but also an ideal that could never be fulfilled. In Peter and Jane's world it is always summer and there are no divorces, domestic violence, paedophiles or illnesses.  Most of all, there is no boredom. Peter and Jane must go to school, but we only ever see them playing, painting, eating, frolicking with their dog or helping Mummy and Daddy. It is  childlike view of the world and when I look at Martin Aitchison's wonderful illustrations, they are a poignant reminder of a time that never was."},
{"title": "Ottakar's RIP", "date": "Monday, December 25, 2006", "text": "This time last year Ottakar's was the second largest chain of specialist booksellers in Britain. Today it no longer exists. The shops have all been absorbed into Waterstone's and the once familiar green and orange livery has been painted over with black.Like most Ottakar's employees I have tried to be realistic about the change of ownership. High street sales have been declining for several years and there is probably only room for one bookselling chain, but why did it have to be Waterstone's? Were they better than Ottakar's? On the face of it the answer is no, but we were the first to go because smaller ships sink more quickly than large ones.I feel very sad about the whole business. Ottakar's was a wonderful company to work for and it was run by booksellers. Waterstone's is largely run by retailers who like to talk about 'product' . It is not the evil empire that some would claim, but like most large companies it is soulless and is driven by procedure rather than passion. At Ottakar's any problem could be resolved swiftly with a one-minute phone call. At Waterstone's it's difficult to find the number.There has been a lot of talk about the 'new Waterstone's' - combining the best of both companies - and it was initially hoped that the input of Ottakar's head office personnel would herald a new era in the company. At the moment the jury is still out. There are good people in Waterstone's and it still offers more hope for bookselling in Britain than any other chain, but at the moment the company still has a long way to go before it can inspire passion and loyalty."},

Hunter should be a household name. She played Stella in the first Broadway production of A Streetcar Named Desire and reprised the role five years later for the film version, winning an Oscar for her perfromance. This should have heralded the beginning of a glittering career, but she became one of the victims of Senator McCarthy and was effectively blacklisted by the main Hollywood studios. As a result, Hunter's body of work is very small but oddly enough, she appears in three of my favourite films.In 1946, Hunter co-starred with David Niven in my favourite film of all time, A Matter of Life and Death...Then, 22 years later, she played a chimpanzee...Kim Hunter's performance as the feisty scientist Zira was one of the highlights of Planet of the Apes. In an interview, Hunter says that it took over four hours to put on the ape make-up and she ended up taking valium to get through it, but it was worth it.Around the same time, Hunter also had a bit part in another of my favourite films, The Swimmer. Hunter continued to work, appearing in the wonderful Beneath the Planet of the Apes and the appalling Escape from the Planet of the Apes but the big film roles eluded her, probably thanks to Hollywood's endemic ageism. She died in 2002 at the age of 79."},
{"title": "Thoughtless", "date": "Saturday, December 16, 2006", "text": "I've written some derogatory comments about my seasonal customers, so it's only fair that I come clean about my own moments of madness. In my time I've managed to recruit a paedophile to work in the children's section (funnily enough, he didn't mention it in the interview), heckle one of my own author events (that lethal combination of stress and alcohol) and confuse Nick Hornby with a shoplifter (he is a shifty-looking man). However, there is one incident that still haunts me.I was once approached by a woman who had written a book about her son, who had hanged himself in a local park a few years earlier. She had decided to write a book as a tribute to him and hoped that it would be of some comfort to parents who had gone through a similar experience.  Would I consider stocking the book and holding a launch party? Of course I said yes.A sample copy of the book arrived a few weeks later. It wasn't great literature, but it didn't matter. The author had endured the worst thing that any parent can experience and writing a book was obviously a cathartic experience for her. We'd hold a launch party, sell a few copies to her friends and that would be it.For the next few weeks she made my life a misery. Had we received the book? Were there enough copies? Should she invite the Mayor or would I do it? Did I think vol-au-vents were better than sausage rolls or should I have a mixture of both? Should we have paper plates? Should she sign the book before or after the main speech? At one point I was receiving three or phone calls a day for several weeks, but if this woman was anxious and obsessive she had every reason to be so.The day before the event a new Patricia Cornwell novel arrived. I asked someone to do a window for it and they came up with what I thought was a brilliant idea. They got a few dustbin bags and filled them as if a body was inside it, then after a trip to a local park, scattered a few dead leaves around the display. I was impressed. Unfortunately they ran out of time and weren't able to put up any posters.The next evening, over 70 people arrived at my shop to attend the launch of a book about a person who died in a local park. As the approached the front window they saw a display which featured a corpse covered in dead leaves. Unsurprisingly, a couple of the dead man's friends assumed that we had created an extremely tasteless window display and seemed pretty upset. I was mortified. Stupidly, I had never made the connection which was now so obvious. I wondered whether I could get away with dismantling the window before too many people noticed, but every time I tried to edge towards the front of the shop I was stopped by someone thanking me for holding the event.In the end I got way with it. The window lights were on a timer and switched off before everyone left. I am still haunted by the memory of that evening and the near-debacle that I only avoided by luck.Back to the present and my delightful seasonal customers, today they became more desperate and impatient than ever. One intelligent-looking woman became quite angry because she couldn't find any James Bond novels. Had she looked in Fiction under Fleming? Of course not. Another customer asked us if we sold fishing rods whilst one insisted that we had two branches in the town. I suggested that the fact that we had a front and back entrance could be deceptive but no, I was wrong. There were definitely two branches."},

Several of them are of well-known figures, but some of them are new to me. For example, has anyone heard of Dr Hans Selye?And can anyone tell me who this man is?Dr Robert Oppenheimer famously declared 'I am death.' This picture must have been taken after he was persecuted by Senator McCarthy into accepting a minor academic position in an American university, as the Oppenheimer of A-bomb fame had jet black hair.This man's brand of horror was slightly more innocuous...Peter Lore looks magnificently creepy in this moodily-lit portrait.Devotees of the French Horn will be familiar with the name Barry Tuckwell. This stunning photo is of his sister Patricia, taken in 1947.Finally, here is a portrait of Vivien Leigh...I never understood why she was regarded as such a beauty until I saw this picture. At first glance it seems a very conventional pose, but notice how Karsh has manipulated the depth of field so that whilst the front of Leigh's face in in focus, the ears are blur."},

His portraits of Churchill, Shaw, Einstein and Hemmingway are well known, but here are a few lesser-known ones:This portrait of Pablo Casals was taken whilst he was playing a Bach cello sonata. You can almost hear the music.How on earth did Karsh get Nikita Krushchev to dress up like this? Karsh wrote 'When I saw him, I thought his strong peasant face demanded a frame. It  was Moscow's first warm spring day, but the Chairman cheerfully sent for the biggest fur coat I've ever seen.'With Brigitte Bardot, Karsh has wisely abandoned any gimics or props and allowed her natural sexiness to speak for itself. I'm sure that Karsh would never have said 'Stick your tits out love' but there is almost a Page Three quality to it.I have never heard of Gratien Gelinas, but I had to include this inspired portrait.I don't recall seeing this photo of the three Apollo 11 astronauts - Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins. It makes a refreshing change from the inane image of them smiling in their space suits and has a heroic, Mount Rushmore quality to it.In the case of Martha Graham, I cannot think of a more fitting tribute to this woman's talents.Finally, here is one of several photographs that Karsh took of Dwight Eisenhower.This has shades of Holbein's Ambassdors.Karsh died in 2002. There was a very good book published after Karsh retired called 'Karsh - a Fifty-Year Retrospective' but it is difficult to get hold of.

{"title": "Sibelius", "date": "Friday, December 08, 2006", "text": "If I was exiled to a desert island and was only allowed to take one thing with me, it would probably be the works of Sibelius.  As a child I belonged to the great mass of people who regarded classical music as boring, but in my teens I heard part of a Sibelius symphony on the radio and I felt as if I had been swept up by a giant wave. I had no idea that music like this existed. I always thought that classical music was the 'tum-tee-tum' banality of Mozart's horn concertos, but listening to Sibelius was made me realise that at its best, music had the potential to achieve a level of profundity that made most other art forms seem crude by comparison.When I was 17 I became obsessed by the 4th Symphony. Sibelius wrote this in his mid-40s and was suffering from a tumorous growth in his throat. Convinced that he was going to die of cancer, Sibelius went away to a remote retreat in the Karelian mountains and wrote one of the most most remarkable pieces of music ever written.When it was completed, the symphony was greeted with boos and hisses in the concert hall and one conductor actually apologised to the audience before the performance, explaining that he didn't like the music but felt that it was his duty to allow it to be heard. Today the music is acknowledged as a masterpiece, but it will probably never make it to the Classic FM 'Top 100'.I realise that this post is of minority interest - to everyone - but if I can convince one person to try the 4th symphony then it will have been worthwhile. Don't listen to it once or twice, but at least three times before you give up (which hopefully won't happen). I hated the music the first time, but like many great works of art it took its time to reveal its secrets.My mother-in-law likes Sibelius but didn't warm to this symphony. It was ironic, as she had just been treated for breast cancer and was going through the same sort of crisis that inspired Sibelius. I told her the background to the music and the next time we spoke, she got it.Amazingly, Sibelius survived the surgery for his throat cancer and lived for another half century, dying in 1957 at the age of 91. Why am I writing about this? Because today is his 141st birthday. Happy Birthday Sibelius!"},
{"title": "Amazon reviews", "date": "Wednesday, December 06, 2006", "text": "When I read Professor John Sutherland's comments about Amazon reviewers I was up in arms. Why should criticism be limited to the cognoscenti? There are thousands of intelligent, well-educated people out there who have a considered view and their opinions are as valid as any professional critic's.That's what I thought last week. However, last night I decided to look up a film and my faith in Amazon reviews took a nosedive.I looked up The Eiger Sanction, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. I saw it the other night for the first time and was expecting something of the calibre of Dirty Harry. Instead I spent two and a half hours watching one of the oddest, most inept films I've ever seen in my life. The film was described as a thriller, with 'Clint Eastwood as a retired assassin on a moutaineering expedition who  knows that one of the party has killed a friend of his. He must find out who the killer is.' It sounded good, in an enjoyably brainless sort of way.Unfortunately the finished result seemed to be three completely separate films which had been crudely edited into a whole, with only a tenuous link between each segment. The actual Eiger bit of the film only began after over 90 minutes had passed and it ended not with a bang, but a very disappointing whimper.I looked up the film on Amazon to see what other people had made of it, expecting some pretty scathing comments, but no, everyone loved it! One review was headed 'Much under-stated', whilst another praised the 'superb screenplay based on a fantastic book'. Were we talking about the same film?Since then I've looked at a number of Amazon reviews and I almost agree with John Sutherland. However, when it comes to books, particularly literary fiction, the calibre of the reviews is generally very high. The sort of person who reads Elfriede Jelinek probably isn't going to write a banal, ungrammatical assessment of a novel. However the film reviews are very hit and miss. If you need a rule of thumb, crap films attract crap reviews, good films attract intelligent ones.On the subject of film, I have no doubt that most people reading this will have seen Atanarjuat - the Fast Runner, but if you haven't, I'd strongly urge you to watch it. As far as I know, it is the first film in the Inuit language and is absolutely stunning. When I told certain people that I'd watched a three-hour film in Inuit featuring a cast of unknown actors, they looked at me as if I was mad. But it's one of those movies that makes you realise how underused the medium of film is most of the time.And the Amazon reviews are very good too."},

So why isn't it selling?To be fair the sales aren't bad by normal standards, but by Palin's this must be a huge disappointment. Why isn't the book in the top five? Perhaps the answer lies in Palin's almost official role as the nicest man in Britain. When I read someone's memoirs I want the sort of scurillous gossip that is almost libelous. Piers Morgan's entertaining Insider is a good example of this and although much of the material seems outrageous and highly suspect, I can only assume that the lack of libel actions means that a large part of it is true. Palin's diaries are far too generous, reasonable and nice to make compelling reading. In fairness I've only read a few entries, but if the book had grabbed me more I'd have read the whole thing by now.Michael Palin isn't alone. Bill Bryson's memoir isn't setting the bestseller charts on fire, whilst the massively-hyped Billy Piper autobiography Growing Pains is being beaten hands down by Richard Dawkins' polemic against religion. Who says that we're dumbing down?As far as fiction is concerned, fewer than 10% of my top 50 bestsellers are hardback fiction and the names are all familiar ones: Ben Elton, Andy McNab, Dick Francis and, of course, Terry Pratchett. Publishers paid a fortune in advances for Diane Setterfield and Michael Cox's debuts, but it looks as if it's going to be a long time before they get their money back unless Saints Richard and Judy intervene.The sports table is also full of surprises. Wayne Rooney was paid a large sum of money for his book and whilst it's ticking along, the sales are nothing compared to Stephen Gerrard's autobiography.So what is selling? At the moment the bestselling autobiography is Peter Kay's The Sound of Laughter, which is outselling everything else by a long chalk. Other bestsellers include Victoria Beckham's guide to fashion (no it isn't a humour title), Jeremy Clarkson's selected rants vol.2, a humorous book about Latin and, to the surprise of many, Pam Ayres' Surgically Enhanced.I saw Pam when she first appeared on Opportunity Knocks, so I'm rooting for her.The Peter Kay biography will be bought by many and read by few. That is the nature of Christmas bestsellers. A few years ago the bestselling book at Christmas was Shane Richie's autobiography. I'd overhear customers saying 'She likes 'im, don't she' and you could sense their relief that they were one present nearer the end of their Christmas shopping(incidentally, research has recently revealed that the average housewife spends 18 hours Christmas shopping!). When the Richie book came out in paperback in time for the summer reading season, we sold fewer than half a dozen. Why? Because no-one actually wanted to read it.Most years there is one book that takes everyone by surprise. Remember the Politically Correct Bedtime Stories, Magic Eye or Eats Shoots and Leaves? This year's book would have been the saucy Janet and John stories from Terry Wogan's morning show, but sadly nobody seized the opportunity. Another contender is Where's Bin Laden? - a spoof of the Where's Wally? books, but it's still early days.It looks like it's going to be a late Christmas in the book trade, in which case the likes of Palin, Piper and Bryson still have a chance of earning back their advances.However, I won't be buying any of these books. I would recommend Peter Ashely's Unmitigated England, which is one of the best books I've seen for a long time. Last year there was a glut of nauseating titles inspired by the dreadful Pocket Book of Patriotism. Unmitigated England is in a class of its own, celebrating things that are uniquely English without ever sinking into sentimental jingoism.Although Christmas in retail begins in late October, it feels like a phoney war until someone fires the starting pistol on December 1st. For the next three weeks, the public will engage in an orgy of spending which will be make or break time for the high street chains.I feel ambivalent about the whole thing. On the one hand I feel disgusted by the way Christmas has become commodified. Seeing crowds of bad-tempered people fighting over goods that will produce a few minutes of pleasure on Christmas Day before being consigned to the attic is a depressing spectacle. On the other hand, I know that if my shop is to survive I need to sell as many unwanted presents as I can, particularly given this year's appalling sales.With the exception of a few chains - Marks and Spencer for example - there has been a steady downturn in high street sales for the last two years. There are three main reasons for this. First, internet usage has now reached the point where 60% of people shop online. The internet is not only more convenient, but is also usually significantly cheaper. Second, there is more competition from supermarkets. Why make a special trip to a bookshop when you can pick up the latest Jordan biography during the weekly shop? Third, many people have borrowed more than they can afford and are feeling squeezed by repayment charges, rising fuel bills and a hike in interest rates.I cannot speak for other retailers, but from a bookseller's persective I think that the next few years are going to be very hard. During the last 20 years, over 400 bookshops have opened. Most of them are over 4,000 sq ft and will have a turnover of at least £1,000,000 a year. This has been a great success story and repudiates the view that people aren't reading any more, but now that people can also buy books online or in their local Tesco, how many bookshops will we need?If my shop's sales continue to decline I can do two things: I can reduce my payroll costs and try and improve my margin from the supplier. However if, after paying for the stock, staff and site, I am making a loss I'm in trouble. Where do I go from there, assuming that I've done everything possible to increase sales?I'm ashamed to say that in my particular case, I do have another option: I can drive a competitor out of business. I would rather focus on positive things like selling more books, but if that isn't happening then I have to do everything I can to safeguard my staff's jobs.I am convinced that he next few years will see a lot of closures in the book trade, but at some point the dust will settle because there will always be a need for proper bookshops where people can browse, attend signings and meet authors. The internet can't replace that. As for Tescos, I'll start worrying when they sell Sartre."},

I must confess that I was disappointed. I probably hadn't given the matter much thought since the age of ten, but in some small corner of my brain he was a member of some elitist sect of highly intelligent people, not a hairdresser called Bill Woodward. The enigmatic Asian woman was a Computer Science student from Hong Kong called Cecilia Fung.This photo must have affected other people too, as someone recently went to the bother of reuniting Bill and Cecilia for another photo shoot...This morning's edition of the Today programme featured a wonderful discussion with Professor Stephen Hawking.

{"title": "The joys of bookselling...", "date": "Tuesday, November 28, 2006", "text": "Christmas is a very special time for booksellers when we get to meet lots of people who don't normally visit bookshops...1.Customer - Have you got that book about the war?Me             - Which book?Customer - The one in the paperMe                 - Which paper?Customer  - I don't knowMe             - Do you know the title?Customer  - I don't think it's got a title2.Me             - Sorry, we've sold outCustomer  - Can you order it in time for Christmas? (asked at 3.00 on Christmas Eve)3.Customer (standing in a stairwell in my shop yesterday) - It's all books...it's all books...My main ambition in life is to escape from the rat race and lead a life that is sustainable. Ideally I would live in a smallholding that could generate its own power and provide enough food to survive independently. It's partly a moral choice, but also a selfish one as I'm fairly certain that life is going to become a lot harder unless our governments make some radical policy changes. I don't want to be dependent on a fragile infrastructure.Does that sound alarmist? Perhaps, but I remember the petrol crisis of 2000 during which a Government agency predicted that if the supply chain was halted for more than two days, civil order would break down and a state of emergency would be declared. We have gone a long way from the nation that was virtually able to feed itself during the Second World War.Therefore when a television series was made about a family trying to switch to an ecologically sustainable life, I had to watch it. 'It's Not Easy Being Green' featured the Strawbridge family, who swapped a happy life in a Worcestershire village to renovate a derelict Cornish farmhouse.It was a very enjoyable series, but unless I have £600,000 to invest and an entourage of specialists to assist me in my engineering and horticultural projects, I'm not sure how relevant the programme is to most people. However, what did inspire me was not the green politics but the Strawbridge family themselves. Whilst I accept that television sanitises everything, it was quite clear that the Strawbridges were a happy family. Normally reality television leaves me feeling depressed about the human condition, but every member of the Strawbridge family was so likeable that I ended up feeling very inadequate.I tried to imagine my family emulating the Strawbridges, but all I could see was my wife complaining about the cold and my sons saying how bored they were without Game Boy. The Strawbridges seemed to have an endless supply of friends who thought nothing of giving up a couple of weeks to help them build a water wheel. I can't think of anyone I know who could spare more than a day. I want to be Dick Strawbridge.Further disilutionment set in when I read about the Brithdir Mawr eco-village in Pembrokeshire. For years I had imagined that this was the gold standard in sustainable living and thought that it would look something like this:But the reality is quite different. Instead of cutting-edge high-tech, low-impact design, we have something that is more Steptoe and Son...The loo is al frescoAnd here is the interior...I don't wish to seem disparaging about Brithdir Mawr and I know that this dwelling isn't representative of the whole settlement, but if we are going to convert mainstream society to the cause of sustainable living, this isn't the way to do it. To be fair to the occupants pictured here, they never set out to publicise their activities. On the contrary, they minded their own business and as far as the authorities were concerned, didn't exist until a series of satellite photos alerted Pembrokeshire County Council to the presence of unauthorised dwellings.We desperately need a model that ordinary people can follow. Not a £600,000 farmhouse or a £600 teepee, but a solution that will convince the ordinary person in the street that it makes sense to change."},

Unfortunately this advert, which I discovered at my mother's house today, was published on November 25th, 1979.In Journey to the Centre of the Earth the extinct volcano of Snaefellsjokull is the gateway to the underworld, so when I visited Iceland last May I had to go there. The day started quite well. I left my hotel well-prepared and began the seven-mile drive that would take me to the edge of the glacier.Unfortunately, two miles into the journey the road became quite steep and narrow, with a surface of lose volcanic rock and dust. My Toyota Yaris started to struggle until it finally ground to a halt, unable to get a grip on the road's surface. I tried edging forward very slowly, but the car didn't move an inch. The road was too narrow to turn round and to my right there was a sheer drop. What should I do?I wondered if it was possible to reverse down to the main road, but the prospect of going backwards down an unfamiliar winding road for a mile didn't fill me with confidence, particularly as I could end up going off the edge. Then I had a dim recollection of seeing someone face this dilemma in a very bad film. Their wheels had spun round, digging deeper into the dust and the situation looked hopeless, but they had got out of it. How? I couldn't remember, but something was telling me to put lots of rocks under the wheels to get a grip. I grabbed several handfuls of volcanic rock of pushed them under the tyres, then got back into the car and very tentatively raised the clutch until I was in first gear. The car started to creep forward. I went into second gear, desperately hoping that I wouldn't get stuck again and drove for a few hundred yards until I reached a turning point.I knew that I couldn't go any further and decided to have a short break before going back to the main road. It was here that I discovered this cave:The inside was covered with dates, names and enigmatic markings. In most other countries in Europe there would have been some sort of visitor centre and gift shop attached, but the wonderful thing about Iceland is that you can have a cave all to yourself and test the acoustic by singing to your heart's content, which I did.Back in the car I nervously crept back to the main road and headed for the northern coast of the Snaefellsness peninsula, where I came across this strange-looking building...With a recommendation like this, I had to explore it.In America this would probably have been the home of a serial killer, patiently waiting for chinless wonders like me to stumble through the front door before falling into a specially constructed pit. However this was Iceland and Arnaldur Indridason aside, I felt confident that I was in a safe place. I parked the car and cautiously walked towards the building, hoping that no-one was there. The doors were hanging off their hinges and inside, the place look as if it hadn't been occupied for years.A stained mattress propped against the wall showed that someone had once lived here but thought better of it. Most of the rooms contained fishing equipment, including a yellow souwester, parts of a boat and some netting.This room was in serious need of some feng shui. By now I had realised that there was a fishing theme to the house and expected to find lots of cod bones, but outside the ground was  covered in seashells.In another room I found a this strange combination of objects. In the unlikely event that any sea fishing experts chance upon this blog, I would be interested to know what is going on here:It was an eerie place, made stranger by the fact that it looked as if it had been abandoned in a hurry. Most of the rooms contained equipment that could have been salvaged and put to good use somewhere else, but they had been left to decay.Just as I was about to leave, I found another door and discovered my serial killer basement. There was a hatch in the floor and a makeshift ladder led down to a cellar where all sorts of strange equipment littered the ground. I've no doubt that ropes and chains are an essential component of a fisherman's toolkit, but I had watched too many films and my imagination started to take over. I left.I continued to explore Snaefellsness until the evening began to draw in. On the way back I stopped by a river and for the first time in my life, bent down, cupped my hands and drank the water. It tasted better than anything I'd ever had before. It reminded me of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, where the water in the west became so sweet that you could drink it."},

The bearded man in the background looks as if he is contemplating some awful deed, possibly involving the boy  scouts. What is this psychopath doing in the pages of Ladybird?

I'm interested in film, but there are big gaps in my knowledge and this wonderful book gave me the opportunity to try movies as diverse as The Verdict, Lantana, The Consequences of Love, Soylent Green and Antanarjuat.Then came '1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die' which, apart from crushing my self-image as a reasonably well-read person, was an exhilirating selection of both the familiar and the obscure.So far so good.Unfortunately, Taschen have now made the grave error of applying this formula to paintings. At first I thought it was a great idea, but the reality is a selection of images that have been reduced to a size that renders many of them meaningless. If I haven't seen a book or film I can easily remedy that with a few clicks of a mouse, but this option doesn't apply to painting.Let's take Holman Hunt's painting The Scapegoat. For years I never understood this painting. I'd often seen reproductions in books, but it always struck me as garish example of Victorian melodrama. Then a few years ago I saw the real thing in an exhibition at the Tate and I realised how wrong I'd been. The picture was much larger than I'd anticipated and it was impossible not to be swept away by the Holman Hunt's bold, visionary genius. But if you look at printed representations of The Scapegoat this is what you get:Three completely different versions - a few more and I could do an Andy Warhol. The point is that the printed page cannot do justice to the majority of works of art and although there are some nice chunky monographs out there, the Taschen book isn't one of them. If I was rich and didn't have a family to consider, perhaps this book would inspire me to visit the great art galleries of the world, but as an armchair read it is a great disappointment."},

It was about three miners enjoying a trip to the seaside and was not only extremely funny but also, at times, very poignant. It was defintely worth seeing again, but like many of the best programmes from the 1970s, it isn't available on DVD.Fortunately, some enterprising souls have decided to throw caution to the wind and sell home-made DVDs on ebay. For less than a tenner I now have The Fishing Party, plus  five other stories from 'Play For Today'. Admitedly the picture quality resembles a 1982 VHS tape that has been rented more than 50 times, but who cares?Since then, I've typed in the names of lots of obscure and half-forgotten programmes (anyone remember The Changes ?) on ebay and I've been surprised by how many are available.

{"title": "Life With a Star", "date": "Friday, November 17, 2006", "text": "One of the many innovations that Ottakar's introduced was an intranet discussion board in which booksellers from Truro to Oban could exchange news and views.  Sometimes it was a little disappointing - the notorious 'What's your favourite crisp flavour?' represented the board's nadir. However MD James Heneage was determined that the intranet should be 'anarchic' so that amongst the interminable threads about graphic novels there would also be an opportunity for innovation and intelligent discussion. One of the most heartening examples of this was a thread I initiated called 'Forgotten masterpieces.'The thread asked booksellers to recommend titles that they felt were unjustly neglected and the response was amazing. So amazing, in fact, that Ottakar's decided to take the best suggestions and include them in a national campaign. Recommended titles included David Malouf's An Imaginary Life, Richard Yates' Revolutionary Road, Antal Szerb's Journey by Moonlight, Jose Saramago's Blindness and Barbara Pym's Quartet in Autumn. I recommended the wonderful Journey by Moonlight and another book which, although it is published by Penguin, seems to elicit blank looks from most people: Jiri Weil's Life With a Star.How can I describe this book if you don't know it? Imagine L'etranger written by a Czech Jew during the Second World War. Weil and Camus are very different writers, but these two novels have one thing in common: the narrator is passive and naive to the point of being one of Dostoyevsky's 'Holy fools'. In Life With a Star the main character, a bank clerk called Roubicek, relates how his rights are gradually being eroded by the occupying Nazis:'From now on you mustn't appear outdoors without a star, I hope I don't have to tell you what would happen to you.'  'You have to stitch down the corners of the star and wear it on the left side, directly over your heart, not any higher or lower. There are very strict regulations about this.'  He handed me a piece of rayon material. 'You mustn't get it dirty.'I went home and stitched the tips of the star with a needle and thread. There were six tips and a word on the star, all contorted and twisted, in a foreign language that seemed to make a face at me.I went out the next day. After all, I had to go shopping. I saw people looking at me. At first it seemed as though my shoelaces were untied or that there was something wrong with my clothes. In some way I had upset the everyday, accepted order of things. And I was alone among other people, completely alone, because people would make way for me. I was no longer one of them.'Hello Sheriff!' a boy called to me. And everyone laughed, but I knew that they weren't laughing at me. I laughed too.'Thanks to Ottakar's, I was able to introduce this book to hundreds of new readers, but I think that this novel deserves thousands."},
{"title": "Apocalypse Now", "date": "Wednesday, November 15, 2006", "text": "I have just finished Cormac McCarthy's 'The Road' and thought it was brilliant, but I would have probably still enjoyed it even if it was rubbish as I have a slight obsession with any fiction or drama that has a post-apocalyptic setting. I've no idea why. My wife thinks that I should talk to my GP about it.For those of you who are also interested in writing which explores the human condition reduced to its barest essentials, here is a list of my top ten post-apocalyptic novels (in no particular order):1.    Margaret Atwood  -              Oryx and Crake2.   Bernard Malamud            - God's Grace3.    John Wyndham -                     The Chrysalids4.   Cormac McCarthy -           The Road5.   Paul Auster -                                       In the Country of Last Things6.    Kurt Vonnegut -             Galapagos7.    Jose Saramago -                             Blindness8.    Philip K Dick -                    Dr            Bloodmoney9.   David Mitchell -                             Cloud Atlas10. Russell Hoban -                        Ridley WalkerI realise that not every novel on the list is strictly post-apocalyptic, but they all deal with the theme of social collapse and its aftermath - something that is preoccupying a growing number of writers at the moment including Jim Crace (or should that be Crachay?), whose next novel 'The Pesthouse' is published in March.With global warming, diminishing oil reseves and the threat of terrorism looming on the horizon, it is no surprise that there are so many speculative fiction titles being published. What is most alarming is the growing belief that we are living in the 'end times'. My second son is one-year-old today and I do not want him growing up in a world being torn apart by religious mania and corporate greed.But before I succumb to a mood of pessimism, I must remember this (rough) quote from the controversial BBC film 'The War Game' - 'It is extremely likely that a nuclear war will have taken place by 1980'. It didn't happen. In the end common sense prevailed and we did the right thing.Any recommendations for further reading would be very welcome.Author Jim Crace popped into a bookshop in London to see if they stocked any of his books. He went up to the desk and asked a woman where they kept their Jim Crace. She guided him to the fiction section and said in a hushed voice 'Oh and by the way, it's pronounced Jim Cra-chay.'He didn't have the heart to say anything."},
{"title": "Bookshop Memories", "date": "Sunday, November 12, 2006", "text": "George Orwell wrote this essay about bookselling 70 years ago, but it could have been written yesterday. Here are a couple of extracts...When I worked in a bookshop - so easily pictured, if you don't work in one, as a kind of paradise in which charming old gentlemen browse eternally among folios - the thing that struck me was the rarity of really bookish people. Our shop had an exceptionally interesting stock, yet I doubt whether ten per cent of our customers knew a good book from a bad one.Many of the people who came to visit us were of a kind who would be a nuisance anywhere but have special opportunities in a bookshop. For example, the dear old lady who doesn't remember the book's name or what it was about, but does remember that it has a red cover.Orwell's wise words provide a sort of fraternal solace, but it is also quite depressing to realise that this has always been the case and probably always will be.When I started in bookselling I imagined that I would be meeting lots of people like myself who were interested in the arts and literature. My day would be filled with discussions with customers about the merits of particular authors and perhaps we would recommend titles to each other. Sadly, I can probably count the number of truly interesting conversations I've had with customers on one hand.I've often thought about why this should be the case and I can only conclude that the sort of people whom I'd like to talk to, i.e intelliegent, thoughtful, empathic individuals, aren't in the habit of going up to complete strangers and starting a conversation.When I ran an independent bookshop I had a dozen or so regular customers who would come in and talk to me. At first I liked the idea of getting to know my regulars and passing the time of day with them, but after a while I found that my heart sank the moment they walked in the door. I began to feel angry with them and couldn't wait for them to go. Why, I asked myself, was I being so hostile to people who were being friendly to me?I realised the reason why: my regular customers weren't having a conversation with me, they were talking at me. I knew where they lived, what they read, how many children they didn't have and all of the minutiae of their lives. I had listened to all of their thoughts and smiled benignly, appearing interested in what they said. What did they know about me? When had anyone asked me about myself? None of my customers would have been able to relate a single fact about my life.Looking back, many of these people lived alone and I may have been the only person they spoke to that day. I should feel compassion for people whose social skills weren't as developed as they should have been, but I only remember how hard it was to be a sounding board day after day.Today things are much better. The intelligent, thoughtful, empathic people that I yearned to meet still rarely appear in my shop as customers but they make up the majority of my staff, who are a pleasure to work with. Thanks to my colleagues, I never wake up in the morning dreading the thought of going to work and ultimately, I feel very lucky to have ended up in bookselling."},

I've never entertained any desire to become a writer but if I did, this book would probably make me stick to the day job. McCarthy's writing is almost audaciously sparse, but achieves more in a few short sentences than two pages of Martin Amis.McCarthy clearly knows that what you don't say is as important, if not more, as what you do and The Road's stark, primordial prose shows the writer at the height of his powers.Try this for size:The clocks stopped at 1:17. A long shear of light and then a series of low concussions. He got up and went to the window. What is it? she said. He didnt answer. He went into the bathroom and threw the lightswitch but the power was already gone. A dull rose glow in the windowglass. He dropped to one knee and raised the lever to stop the tub and then turned on both taps as far as they would go. She was standing in the doorway in her nightwear, clutching the jamb, cradling her belly in one hand. What is it? she said. What is happening?I don't know.Why are you taking a bath?I'm not.Once in those early years he'd wakened in a barren wood and lay listening to flocks of migratory birds overhead in the bitter dark.

Shops closed early, windows were boarded up and several hundred police and emergency workers were drafted in from other parts of Sussex to cope with the crowds and  prevent the town from being burnt to a cinder.It is amazing that in this health and safety conscious age, people are permitted to parade through Lewes carrying flaming torches, wheeling barrows of burning tar and throwing fireworks, but this is a fiercely independent town that is proud of its traditions. During the English Civil War, Lewes was one of the few places in this area to support Parliament and this tradition of dissent continues to the present day.Shortly before the US-led invasion of Iraq, the people of Lewes were some of the most vocal opponents of the war and held a public debate in the town hall to discuss the matter. A representative from the American Embassy attended the meeting and obviously thought that he was going to a quaint little town in the countryside occupied by old maids and retired colonels. He looked visibly shaken to be confronted by several hundred highly-educated, articulate and angry Lewesians and I think it's fair to say that the evening wasn't his finest hour(to show its appreciation of American foreign policy, a giant effigy of George Bush holding a little Tony Blair in his hands was burned at one of the main bonfire sites on Saturday).But Lewes isn't some hotbed of raving Socialism (most people vote Liberal or Green) and for all its apparent anti-Americanism, it is proud of its links with Tomas Paine. I think the key to Lewes is that it is a town in which tradition, continuity and living in harmony with the environment are valued more than in most places. This is because it was largely unaffected by the Industrial Revolution and has also, thanks to the geography of the local area, only suffered from limited development. There are a few chain stores and supermarkets, but they do not dominate the Lewes.Most Lewesians are passionate about their town and want little more than to keep things as they are (although they would like a cinema!). This is an eccentric, quirky town with a rich heritage surrounded by beautiful countryside. Why would anyone want to change it?I don't know if McDonald's have ever tried to open a branch in Lewes, but I don't imagine that they'd get very far. A McDonald's was opened in Glastonbury, in defiance of intense local opposition. It was burned to the ground within three days of opening and the culprits were never caught. Like Lewes, many of the inhabitants of Glastonbury are proud of their past and will do whatever is necessary to protect it against the forces of globalisation.At the moment the world is experiencing rapid population growth and for the first time in history, city dwellers outnumber the rural population. However, although the future looked as if it was going to be an age of globalisation in which huge conurbations with multicultural populations were linked by motorways and cheap air travel, we are now beginning to realise that we are doomed if we pursue this course. If we are to survive global warming and the depletion of resources, our future probably lies in small, self-sustaining communities. Towns like Lewes may seem to be a relic of the past, but I am convinced that they are actually a model for the future."},

If I'm given a bedroom of my own and can freshen up the following morning, fine, but the thought of waking up on a sofa in an unfamiliar house fills me with dread. I also hate the prospect of having to make my way home with a crushing hangover.However, when an evening out with some workmates turned into a major drinking session I was more than happy to accept a generous offer of a bed for the night. In the morning I woke up feeling a little the worse for wear and went to the bathroom. This is what I found...Had I unwittingly ended up in a crack den? I was intending to have a bath, but after seeing the state of the carpet I decided not to bother.I wish that I wasn't so suburban in my attitudes. When I'm in a busy restaurant surrounded by friends, downing flaming Sambucas, I think that I'm being terribly Bohemian. But once the alcohol has worn off, I turn into my mother and start tutting about the general level of cleanliness.I don't suppose I'll change."},

{"title": "Mind games", "date": "Friday, November 03, 2006", "text": "I spotted this book today. It was ordered by a customer and after flicking through it, I am extremely glad that I don't work with her.The cover is pretty self-explanatory. The book contains a number of activities which, the back cover claims, will improve the morale of a 'team' in the workplace. One excercise requires each employee to recount an episode from their childhood that made them feel particularly proud and this is then thrown out to the rest of the team to discuss it. Whenever I see the word team used in a business context I feel a sense of dread because it is invariably a euphemism for conformity.In my workplace I manage intelligent, interesting people who who ask very little of me except that I treat them with respect, give them a clear idea of what's expected of them, provide them with the tools to do their jobs and recognise what they achieve. The morale is good. There is no bitching behind people's backs, sick leave is almost non-existent and although we are all quite different people (with a 49-year gap between the oldest and youngest employee) we seem to get on with each other and have had some good nights out.I'm sure that the reason for our good working environment is based on mutual respect. We are all very different, but each of us has something to add to the whole. Sadly, the trend in many workplaces seems to be towards uniformity and rather than celebrating people's individuality, it is often seen as a threat.It's strange how so many right-wing businesspeople extol the virtues of the free market and personal choice whilst running their workplaces like Soviet Russia. Motivated by a mixture of fear and ambition, employees in many businesses are not only asked to work hard but to also adopt their employer's values. Conformity is rewarded, dissent is punished.This is why 'The Big Book of Teambuilding Games' is so offensive. Apart from being extremely patronising, it operates from the premise that it is not enough for people to just do their jobs, they must also have their souls re-engineered. Why should grown adults have to humiliate themselves by playing with Lego bricks or struggling across a freezing cold river on an outward bound course? And God help you if you're introverted because that means you're not a team player, even if you're doing a good job.Perhaps I'm overreacting to this silly book, but I don't like what it stands for. I've nothing against a team attitude and think that a unified sense of purpose is vital, but it must spring naturally from employees and that can only be achieved by making people feel involved, motivated and respected. If a workplace is unhappy, no amount of games or excercises will change that until the fundamental causes are dealt with."},
{"title": "Motherly love...", "date": "Tuesday, October 31, 2006", "text": "On Monday morning I arrived at work and found a copy of the News of the World in the staff room! I have just employed several new Sunday people and they all seemed intelligent and well-adjusted, but there was obviously a cuckoo in the nest.I trawled through the employee handbook to see whether there were legal grounds for sacking someone on the basis of what newspaper they read, but it was unclear what I should do. Then I noticed that there had been a free DVD of a George A Romero film and it all made sense. Johnny. I breathed a sigh of relief, sat down and spent the next hour reading the newspaper, where I found this particularly depressing article...Interviewed by a News of the World journalist, Kerry Katona's mother Sue gives a life-affirming account of the mother-daughter relationship. After describing how Kerry lost her virginity at 14, Sue recounts an episode that took place three years later when Kerry was sleeping with Sue's employer.'The bloke was 25, a cheeky Scouser called Dean, and I was absolutely furious. I knew he was a bastard and I didn't want a man like that going with my daughter, never mind sleeping with her. And he was courting someone.'Fair enough, but what was Sue's novel solution to the problem?'One night after work...he offered me a lift home and said he has some wine for us to drink. I f***** him that night, purely so I could tell Kerry what he was really like and end the relationship. Next day I went to see her and said that I'd f***** your boyfriend last night. She asked why and I told her it was to show her what a total c*** he was.'The next day, Sue went into work and 'beat the guy up...because he'd cheated on my daughter.'Yes, with YOU Sue!Sue then goes on to relate an incident when Kerry, still a schoolgirl, asked how mother about oral sex. 'I told her to get a carrot out of the fridge and I showed her. It may not be conventional , but that's the way I did it.'Nice.'I've been out with some bad men and Kerry saw things as a kid she shouldn't have. And when I lived with a woman called Tina she got bullied at school because her mum was a lesbian. I beat up the teacher because he did nothing about it. Tina and I finally split because she beat me up - then I knifed her and she needed 17 stitches.'Later, 'fame-hungry' Kerry sneaked off to have topless photos taken. As she was still legally underage this action prompted a call from social services. A social worker turned up at the Katona household and his gay persona prompted Sue to comment 'You wouldn't have a problem if she had a dick, would you!'Next to this article there is a short interview with Sue's sister Josie who claims that Kerry and Sue snort coke together.By this point I felt totally depressed by what I'd read. I'd like to think that the whole thing was a tabloid fabrication, but it's horribly plausible. There is an underclass in this country that seem to inhabit a different universe and I don't know why this is. Once we would have cited poverty as the cause, but it is more complicated than that.My mother grew up in relative poverty: a family of six occupying the upstairs floor of a small, semi-detached house, three sisters sharing a bed and the parents sleeping in a large cupboard. However, like many people in her class, her family had a strong moral framework and would have rather starved to death than take something that didn't belong to them.How have people like Sue Katona come to exist? Why have things changed? Is it the collapse of organised religion, the breakdown of local communities, the influence of American film and television, the benefits culture, the consumer culture, post-modernism or all of these that have  created a climate in which Kerry Katona is now described as a 'role model'?"},
{"title": "Mentioning the War...", "date": "Saturday, October 28, 2006", "text": "One of the best films in recent years is Downfall. Seeing the Second World War from the German perspective is always fascinating and Bruno Ganz's portrayal of Hitler has got to be one of the ten greatest performances in the history of cinema.However Downfall has eclipsed another fine German movie, Sophie Scholl, which depicts the true story of a 21-year-old German girl who was executed for treason in 1943. I'm not quite sure why the film focused almost entirely on Sophie, as her brother and a friend were also captured and subjected to a kangaroo court before being condemned to death with her, but the result is a success. Julia Jentsch (who was also in The Edukators) delivers a mesmerising performance as Sophie Scholl and quite rightly won the Best Actress award at the European Film Academy Awards of 2005.Sophie Scholl also beat two excellent films, Hidden and My Summer of Love to win the Best Film award which is slightly surprising, as this is in many ways the least challenging of the three films.Perhaps what is so remarkable about this film is the insight that it gives into an aspect of Nazi Germany that so few of us are aware of. We talk of the Germans and the Nazis as if they were one and the same thing and see no dichotomy between belligerent, bellicose country that conquered most of Europe in the 40s and the peaceful democracy that gave us the soporific  tones of James Last and Richard Clayderman.During the war it was necessary to portray the enemy as universally evil, but sadly this  propaganda has become embedded in the national psyche and remains with us today. How many people are aware of the fact that the Communist Party was as big as the National Socialist movement before Hitler took power and erradicated all opposition? Of course it could be argued that it is typical that a German film should focus on an isolated act of heroism rather than the more general atrocities committed by hundreds of thousands of Germans, but I think the film served a very useful purpose. The many millions of Germans who weren't Nazi didn't all disappear or convert overnight. They felt impotent in the face of a totalitarian state and remained silent.Sophie Scholl is a tribute to the bravery of the few, but also a reminder of how dificult it was for ordinary Germans to fight Naziism. Sophie and Hans Scholl tried and paid the price.Last Christmas was, perhaps, the most important one for the book trade since the demise of the Net Book Agreement. The tills rang as usual and thousands of books were sold, but the end results made dismal reading for most booksellers thanks to a fundamental shift in the way people buy books. Internet retailing has revolutionised bookselling, particularly since internet usage has changed from being the province of geeks to a mainstream activity and now 60% of people in Britain shop online. But in addition to internet retailing, bookshops have also faced competition from supermarkets who buy in bulk and sell cheap.Last year, when highstreet booksellers realised that the sales weren't coming through, they began an orgy of price cutting that led to many key titles being sold at cost price. The end result of this was the the profits were slashed and one chain went to the wall.This Christmas Waterstone's has said that it is going to keep its nerve and focus on the positives. They have doubled their marketing spend and have taken the radical step of advertising in the Sun, which would probably have Tim Waterstone turning in his grave if he wasn't still alive. They also hope that the acquisition of Ottakar's and the resumption of independent online trading will herald a stronger Christmas. But will it?There is certainly a strong selection of titles this year and the pricing is very competitive, but what I hear on the shop floor alarms me. Customers seem very clued-up. They like our wide range of books and we're their first port of call when they want to make a buying decision, but once they've chosen a title there is no guarantee that they'll buy it from us. I overhear people saying that they'll buy it from Amazon or try the competition first. Even if we've taken £7 off a hardback novel, customers often believe that there's a better deal out there.When I try to explain this fundamental change to people, the stock response is 'Oh but people will always want to buy books in bookshops.' Well yes, maybe, but it is not enough to keep half or even three quarters of your customers. I once ran a shop which took around £60,000 a month. The rent and rates were £15,000 per month, the wage bill was about £10,000 and this the stock cost about £35,000. Add heating, lighting, banking and other occupational costs and we were struggling for most of the year. The only thing that kept us afloat was the prospect of making £200,000 in December.If bookshops like for like sales continue to collapse, then we will see closures. Independent booksellers may feel a certain schadenfreude if Waterstone's fails, but anyone who cares about books should support the high street, chains or otherwise. I remember the misery of having nowhere to buy books except a drab, poorly stocked independent run by a misanthropist, or WH Smith's. Waterstone's revitalised bookselling bringing city centre standards to small towns and while some independents died, many good ones continued to prosper.My gut feeling is that book retailing has over-expanded during the last twenty years and will go through a period of contraction before it re-adjusts itself. Shops in downmarket towns and those with high rents may go to the wall, but the majority will probably survive. I am convinced that most readers want bookshops, but in a world where time is as important as money, people will also opt for the convenience of the supermarket and on-line bookstore.There are a lot of changes taking place in Waterstone's under its new managing director and from what I can see, he's doing all the right things for a large retail chain. He's invested in on-line bookselling, tried to make Waterstone's more accessible to the non-traditional book buyer and is maintaining a sensible price strategy. But will this be enough?  I certainly no longer feel that I have a secure job any more and even if I do, will I want to stay?POSTSCRIPT - AUGUST 2013: Just over a year after writing this post, I took the 'jump before you're pushed' option and left Waterstone's. Since then, I've watched the chain go through a slow and steady decline (almost going under a couple of years ago), while Borders and many a good independent have disappeared from the high street. I saw the writing on the wall seven years ago, but underestimated the scale of the collapse and failed to foresee just how big an impact the ebook and smartphone would have on the bookselling environment. We need bookshops - browsing online is pretty frustrating - but don't seem to be prepared to pay for them."},
{"title": "The Turn of the Screw", "date": "Friday, October 27, 2006", "text": "After the success of my first experience with opera, I decided to visit Glyndebourne to see Benjamin Britten's adaptation of Henry James' 'Turn of the Screw'. Glyndebourne is weird. It is as if someone has picked up a chunk of London's South Bank complex and dropped it into a field in the middle of the Sussex Downs. It has a decent sized concert hall and stage, a top class restaurant and a massive car park, but driving down the narrow country lanes that approach it, you could easily miss the turning. I only found Glyndebourne because I was stuck behind a Toyata Prius and  one guessed that the sort of person who could afford one would probably be going to Glyndebourne. Luckily I was right.The evening was a huge disappointment. The production was good but I realised that I didn't like the music, which lacked heart, and I also had no idea what was going on. The Shostakovich opera I saw last week was in Russian, so there were 'surtitles'. Britten's opera was in English and surtitles weren't deemed necessary, but I couldn't understand a word anyone was saying through the throaty vibratos.After the first half hour the dim lighting had a soporific effect on me and I started to nod off. By the end of the first act I had woken up but was faced with a dilemma: should I stay or should I go? Reader, I went.I was tempted to stay. I didn't like the idea of giving up on an important work of art and I also felt that I should get my money's worth, but I also thought that life is too short to put myself through another hour of torment so when the interval began, I walked to my car and drove home. That is the plus side of going to things on your own - if you don't like it you can just go.Click here to visit this superb blog and read an anecdote that is, sadly, not an unusual occurrence in the heady world of bookselling."},
{"title": "The food chain", "date": "Wednesday, October 25, 2006", "text": "In today's BBC News web site there is a story about a pelican that horrified locals and tourists in a London park by suddenly picking up a pigeon in its beak. The pigeon spent a traumatic 20 minutes in the beak (or is it bill?) before the pelican decided to swallow it. What a horrible way to go.Apparently pelicans normally only eat fish, so this pigeon was particularly unlucky. However, even in the midst of tragedy there is always something comical about pigeons.Further up the food chain, Britain's second largest specialist chain of bookshops, Ottakar's, has been bought by the largest one, Waterstone's. The takeover happened in July and like the pigeon, Ottakar's has spent an uncomfortably long time in the jaws of its captor before being devoured. However, the last branch will be converted to Waterstone's within the next few weeks and Ottakar's will cease to exist.Within the current economic climate, the  takeover of Ottakar's seems to make sense.  It is unlikely that Ottakar's would have continued to function as an independent bookseller in the face of growing competition  from internet retailers and the supermarkets and in that context, this is the best possible outcome. But as someone who has spent ten very happy years working for Ottakar's, I feel a great sense of loss. In some ways, I would rather have gone down with the ship.Ottakar's was a very unusual company. One outside observer said that it was more like a religious cult, as the morale was extraordinarily high and most of the employees were fiercely loyal to the point where, until recently, the staff turnover amongst managers was almost zero. There were many reasons for this, but the root of Ottakar's success was the ethos of its founder James Heneage.Sadly, this photo portrays a rather severe and pensive man, rather than the eccentric, warm, humorous and occasionally outrageous person that I knew. However, the Dalek in the background gives the game away.James Heneage created a company culture in which individualism was celebrated and every employee felt valued. He knew that the staff were his greatest asset and strived to create a structure which gave as much autonomy as possible to the hundreds of bright, overqualified staff that he employed. In most businesses I can think of, dissention is seen as a threat. In Ottakar's I always felt that any idea that I had, however bizarre, would be treated with respect if I could provide a decent argument to support my views.Waterstone's is not quite the evil empire that some have tried to portray. With a few notable exceptions, most of the people I've have met so far seem perfectly okay, but it is a much larger company and I know that I am now a small fish in a very big stream.(November 2008 - Two years on, over two-thirds of the Ottakar's managers have now left Waterstone's)"},

In 1946 Formby flew to South Africa to begin a tour and was warned by Daniel Malan, the head of the National Party, that it would be unwise to perform to 'coloured' audiences.Formby  ignored the warning and outraged the founders of Apartheid by performing 20 shows to black audiences without charging a fee. To add insult to injury, he kissed a black child on stage.  The next day a group of National Party members visited Formby and his wife at their hotel, only to have the door slammed in their faces. Daniel Malan phoned Beryl Formby and began to complain, but she interupted him saying 'Oh piss off, you horrible little man.'This anecdote came as something of a surprise as I'd always associated Formby with the Mr Wu songs and the joke about 'If you've got a chink in your window, you'll have another one at your door'. However, it is clear that Formby and his wife are unsung heroes of the anti-Apartheid movement and deserve some credit for their stance, unlike 'Queen', who played Sun City 30 years later."},

Descibed as a new way to understand why nations rise and fall, the J-curve is a hypothesis that has a variety of applications.  The picture below shows how the J-curve  can be applied in a business environment,  but in Ian Bremmer's book the factors of value and time are replaced by  stability and openess.On the extreme lefthand side of the graph are nations like North Korea that achieve a level of stability through being extremely oppressive but are ultimately undermined by the threat of eventual revolution. On the far right are countries like Sweden, which have long-established democratic institutions. The J-curve supposedly demonstrates that for a nation to go from being extremely oppressive to a successful democracy, it must first go through a period of instability. In other words, things will get worse before they get better (or to quote Lenin 'You have to take one step back to take two steps forward').Perhaps I'm being unnecessarily critical, but isn't the J-curve stating the bloody obvious? Do we really need another fatuous 'one size fits all' formula to reduce global politics to a series of easy solutions? According to the author, the answer is yes and he cites a number of examples where American foreign policy would have benefited from observing the J-curve.I'm not convinced. I agree with the basic tennets of the J-curve because they aren't particularly controversial, but I don't like Ian Bremmer's assumption that globalisation is a good thing and I don't agree that American-style democracy is always a great gift that should be bestowed upon the world. The last sentence of the book reads: Only the free exchange of information, values, ideas and people can build a sustainable global stability that enriches all who take part in it. At first glance these are fine words, but this a world in which everything is dominated by the free market. Behind Bremmer's desire to see a world comprised of stable democracies there is the unspoken assumption that these countries must acceptable to the United States.Perhaps I am doing Paul Bremmer a disservice. As a bookseller I can't help groaning every time a new book arrives offering to reduce complex issues to a simple formula. However, the J-curve seems particularly simplistic. It's one saving grace is that it baldly exposes the failings of George Bush's foreign policy and anticipates the change of heart that is now taking place in the Whitehouse."},
{"title": "A night at the opera...", "date": "Wednesday, October 18, 2006", "text": "Last night I went to my first opera. It was a spur of the moment thing, prompted by a glowing review in the Sunday Times of Richard Jones' award-winning production of Shostakovich's opera 'Lady MacBeth of Mtsensk District'. The review mentioned that there were only two performances left before the end of its run and I was suddenly seized by the irrational fear that I might die without ever seeing an opera, even though I am relatively young and healthy. I logged onto the Royal Opera House's web site and booked a ticket for last night.I was not a complete stranger to Shostakovich. I first discovered his music when I was 17 and have been a keen fan ever since, but I have always had a problem with opera. In the 19th century some argued that opera was the highest art form, containing a sythesis of the musical, visual and dramatic arts, but as far as I was concerned it was a lot of fat Italians singing in wobbly voices, pretending that they were lovestruck teenagers. If I was going to see an opera, I was determined that it would be a modern one.To give a brief background to Lady Macbeth, Shostakovich wrote it when he was 26 and it proved to be such a success that there were three productions running concurrently in Moscow. Then, one night in 1936, Stalin and his cronies attended. Stalin hated the savage satirical wit and seedy decadence of the plot and stormed out before the last act. A few days later an article appeared in Pravda entitled 'Muddle Instead of Music' and the opera was withdrawn from public performance. Shostakovich spent several months waiting for a knock on the door from the secret police, but luckily he survived.I arrived at the Royal Opera House feeling slightly anxious about the prospect of sitting through three and a half hours of Russian opera, but I needn't have worried. From the very first moment I was gripped. Seventy years on, the music still had the power to shock and I was bowled over by the fantastic performances and beautiful stage design. I always imagined that there would be a stuffy atmosphere at an opera, but the audience often roared with laughter at the outrageous, bawdy humour in the libretto. I'm so glad that I overcame my prejudices and went to the opera. I can now see what all the fuss is about."},

It was a great day and the battle was spectacular, but my own personal highlight was seeing two women in medieval costume using a cashpoint machine...I bought my eldest son with me who was bored silly and just wanted to play computer games.  We spent half of the day sitting in a damp field waiting for something to happen.Sadly, when it did happen, my son had lost all interest. The hand-to-hand fighting and cavalry charges failed to distract him from his sacred mission of exploring all of the ringtones on my mobile phone.However he was temporarily distracted by a wonderful volley of arrows from the archers and uttered some annoying American superlative that he'd picked up from a television programme, before returning to the phone. I wondered why he was so unmoved by the spectacle of a couple of thousand people in authentic armour staging a battle and tried to remember how I felt when I was seven. But I was over-complicating things: he just wanted someone to play with and looked longingly at the gangs of young boys staging sword fights.When I knew that I was going to be a father, I had visions of idyllic days spent exploring castles, beaches and museums together.  The reality is a seven-year old boy who spends half the day asking me 'Are we nearly there yet?'  and the other half wanting to know when we're going home. I know what makes him happy: computer games, ice cream, sweets and, most of all, other children. Maybe I should bring one of his friends along next time.I had a lovely day, mainly because I did have someone to play with. I met up with two old friends from university, one of whom donned his armour and joined the battle while his wife and I watched two thousand accountants, sales managers, postmen, teachers and every other profession you could imagine charging across a field in costume.  It was wonderfully English: grey skies with the constant threat of rain,  sitting in a damp muddy field waiting  for something to happen. I shall be back for the 950th annivesrary."},
{"title": "Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy", "date": "Thursday, October 12, 2006", "text": "When I was a teenager I had an obsession with David Hockney's painting Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy. I can't remember why I liked it so much, as it no longer has the same appeal. Perhaps the picture's realism made it more attractive to my untrained mind, but I also wonder if I felt attracted to the subjects, Celia and Ossie Clark. At the time I had no idea who they were, I just saw a successful, young couple who seemed stylish and confident. Adding a cat (whose real name was Blanche) on Ossie Clark's lap was a masterstroke. I liked the way that 'Percy' showed no interest in the artist and prefered to look out of the window.Some years later I picked up a newspaper and read that a fashion designer called Ossie Clark had been stabbed to death by his gay lover. I almost didn't bother reading the full article until I realised that this was the Mr Clark depicted in Hockney's famous painting. I had often wondered who Mr and Mrs Clark were and discovered that they were both celebrated fashion designers in the 1960s, on a par with Mary Quant. Married in 1969, the Clarks seemed the epitome of success but their marriage only lasted four years and in 1983, Ossie Clark was bankrupt.  The story of how Ossie Clark's life went off the rails was long and convoluted and I won't relate it here, but it was sobering to realise what happened to the confident young man in the painting with the insoucient expression on his face.Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy was voted one of the top ten favourite British paintings in a poll several years ago and whilst that doesn't mean it has any artistic merit, it is interesting that this picture has captured the imagination of so many people. I expect that the National Portrait Gallery's new Hockney retrospective will be be very popular.Ossie Clark may no longer be with us, but 36 years after the portrait was painted Mrs Clark is alive and well. Last week Celia Birtwell appeared with Hockney for a photo session and even managed to wear the same dress..."},

I asked, desperately hoping that she wouldn't tell me that he was either extremely dull or a complete bastard. She related the following anecdote...Leslie Phillips had been invited to appear at an arts festival and my friend phoned him to see when it would be convenient for him to go.

{"title": "Crime and Punishment", "date": "Tuesday, October 10, 2006", "text": "It is a mild October morning and at first glance I could be on a university campus. Set amongst carefully landscaped gardens, there are several lowrise redbrick halls, each one named after named after a species of British bird. However, I am surrounded by high fences topped with barbed wire and have to be accompanied by a prison guard. Welcome to Feltham Young Offenders Institute.If you are between the ages of 15-21, live in Greater London and are charged with committing a serious crime, the likelihood is that you'll end up here. Each year 30,000 young men pass through Feltham's gates, although there are only 600 at any one time.  I am visiting because I do some voluntary work in my spare time and have to visit two penal institutions as part of my training. Like most people I have opinions about crime and punishment, but I have never set foot in a prison and I feel nervous, not sure of what I'm going to find.The visit begins in the vocational training area. This is where offenders ('Although we don't call them that any more' I'm told) can learn skills in painting and decorating, bricklaying and motor mechanics. This is prison at its best, attempting to reform by making the young men here employable. We are allowed to talk to the inmates, sorry, young adults and I'm struck by how likeable most of them are. Where are the resentful stares and killer eyes? Later I discover that one of them is a murderer and won't leave the prison system until 2020.The workshops are impressive, but 80% of the inmates never attend them. Sometimes this is due to behavioural difficulties, but the main problem in Feltham is that it is a remand centre and very few people stay long enough to make vocational training feasible.Next we move on to the educational centre. We are warned that the 'lads' may be a little cheeky, as many of them resent the schooling that is compulsory for the under 16s. We enter a long corridor, with classrooms on either side. Instead of internal walls, the classrooms are separated from the corridor by safety glass so that the prison officers can see everything and guarantee the teachers' safety. There are quite a few women in the unit and I wonder how the attractive young cookery teacher handles a roomful of testosterone-fuelled males.I feel uncomfortable looking through the glass at the inmates, as if they're exhibits in a zoo and I feel relieved when we move on to the induction area, where new offenders spend their first night. At first glance it reminds me of the entrance to a student union bar, but when I realise that the brightly-coloured doors are all cells the reality sinks in. We look at a cell that has been specially designed to prevent 'at risk' prisoners harming themselves. Each cell has its own sink, toilet and televsion, but this is not the soft option that the Daily Mail would like to have us believe. The cell is depressingly bleak. The sink and loo are both dirty and the room stinks of stale tobacco. There used to be 900 inmates in Feltham, but after the notorious incident a few years ago when a racist, psychotic white male killed his Asian roommate, it was decided not to have shared cells any more.After a brief inspection of the sports hall we end our visit by meeting a member of the management team. Like the other staff we have spoken to she seems refreshingly candid about the problems that Feltham faces and doesn't try to evade any awkward questions. Her prognosis is pretty bleak: most of the inmates have been abused at some point in their lives, many have learning or behavioural difficulties and the grim reality is that most of them will reoffend. Her team do what they can to rescue the more promising individuls, but it an uphill struggle.I leave Feltham with more questions than answers. Why are at least 80% of the prisoners black? Did we see the real Feltham or a sanitised version? Are the staff as respectful towards the inmates as they claim? But the biggest question of all is why our justice system is unable to do more to rescue young males from a life of crime. Perhaps Ignatius Loyola was right and even 15 is too old to save someone, but that seems a bleak prospect and one that is hard to reconcile with the often likeable young men that I met today."},
{"title": "Notes from the Underground...", "date": "Wednesday, October 04, 2006", "text": "Twenty miles east of London, in the heart of the Essex countryside, there is a fairly innocuous-looking building which is surrounded by a small wood and several dozen acres of farmland.There is nothing remarkable about this building on the outside. It looks like a poorly-designed 1950s bungalow, but once you enter the front door it becomes a different story...A long tunnel takes you into the heart of a bunker that would, in the event of a nuclear war, have been the seat of the British government. It was decommissioned in the early 1990s. The optimist in me says that this was due to the end of the Cold War, but the pessimist wonders if they didn't build a better bunker somewhere else.Kelvedon Hatch Bunker is now owned by the farming family whose land was compulsorily purchased by the Government in the 1950s and they have turned it into one of the strangest tourist attractions I have ever visited.I arrived at the lowest level, which housed a huge engine room. The machines contained everything necessary to ensure that several hundred civil servants could survive a nuclear attack, hermetically sealed from the outside world. There were generators for electricity, air filters and water pumps, plus three months' worth of diesel fuel.The room below contained equipment named AWDREY - a cosy acronym for something utterly chilling - Atomic Weapons Distribution Recognition and Estimation of Yield.The AWDREY room also had wooden pigeon holes for staff to store index cards. One row was headed Fatalities, another said Casualties and I tried to imagine the bunker's personnel calmly going about their business, filing the information in the wake of a nuclear holocaust. With the possible exception of the Prime Minister and a few senior staff, no-one was allowed to bring their family with them. How could anyone work in this environment, knowing that their family and friends had either been killed or were suffering from radiation sickness?The larger rooms contained row upon row of desks. Some were divided up into ministries with one chair for each. Others were allocated to the armed forces and the police. I also noticed that there was a room for the BBC to broadcast reassuring messages to the nation and a surprisingly spartan bedroom for the Prime Minister with a large map of London on the wall.With only three months of fuel, the bunker's inhabitants would have to venture outside at some point and there was a plentiful supply of fallout suits and geiger counters. What would they have found once they opened the protective hatch? Research suggests that London and the surrounding area would have been heavily targeted with casualties in the region of 75% plus and there would be little, if no infrastructure for the entombed ministries to govern.Why was Kelvedon Hatch built? Was it just a strategic tool in NATO's attempt to convince the Soviet Union that it meant business, or did the British Government really think that they could successfully wage a nuclear war and restore some vestige of civil authority afterwards? Either way, it was a terrifying place. The current owners decided to enhance the ambience by playing sound effects of telex machines, four-minute warnings and, in the hospital ward, recordings of men groaning in agony. I do not normally suffer from claustrophobia, but after an hour underground listening to the sounds of bombs and the wailing of the dying, I decided to give the gift shop a miss.Leaving the bunker was one of the most moving experiences of my life. I walked down a long, dark, corrugated metal tunnel. In the distance the daylight was a brilliant, blinding white. As I emerged from the tunnel I felt the warmth of the sun on my face and saw that I was on the edge of the woods. The world was still here. It is difficult to write this without sounding sentimental and crass, but as I looked at the grass and wild flowers I felt an immense relief and gratitude that affected me for a long time afterwards.If you fancy a great day out with fun for all the family, visit Kelvedon Hatch's web site for more information."},

If you don't know the place, it's roughly halfway between London and the south coast, has a population of 27,000 and is 5% charming medieval Sussex town, 95% badly designed twentieth century housing. Apparently Daphne from 'Frasier' grew up there, but as far as I know she's never returned.East Grinstead's problem is that it is neither fish nor fowl. It lacks the excitement and cultural activity of London, but it is also too suburban for anyone to enjoy the delights of a traditional, rural community. Like many small towns in England, the place only really comes to life on a Friday night, when the local kids get drunk and beat the crap out of each other. Happy days.I felt sorry for him, but then his story became even more tragic. To add insult to injury, he discovered that he couldn't afford to live in East Grinstead and had to move to a suburb called Felbridge. It was hard to imagine a place as small as East Grinstead having a suburb and it reminded me of an asteroid that was discovered around ten years ago. No asteroids are exciting and this one was smaller and duller than most, but it aroused the interest of scientists because it had caught a small lump of rock in its tiny gravitational field and this boulder was now the asteroid's moon, faithfully orbiting it at regular intervals. Here's a NASA photo:Beneath its bland exterior, East Grinstead harbours a dark secret. It is home to several religious cults, including the Mormons and Scientologists (Tom Cruise and John Travolta have been spotted walking past the local Wimpy Bar). Also, there is an Al Qaeda training camp for would-be suicide bombers.I worked in East Grinstead for a few months and I have to confess that I was quite happy there. The town was bland, but far less offensive than many places in England. It is a sad fact that most English towns and cities have been ruined by the unholy alliance of the Luftwaffe and 1960s town planners, producing town centres like this:Fortunately, I'm lucky enough to live in a town that hasn't changed much during the last 100 years and the locals will always give you a warm welcome..."},

His publicist told me that we had the biggest turnout for the whole tour, beating large stores in cities like Birmingham and Manchester. I'd to think that it was down to our brilliant organisation, but I've also noticed that in smaller towns the locals are far more appreciative if a big name author bothers to make an appearance.Quite a few people in the queue had never been to a book signing before and didn't know what to do. I wanted to say 'Just buy the bloody book!', as two days earlier we'd had a Peter Andre event which had bought the town to a standstill, but resulted in a mere 48 copies sold. After talking to people in the queue, I discovered that most of them weren't sure if we'd be selling the book and bought it in advance, just to be on the safe side. I was flaberghasted. Why did they think that were holding the event? In what perverted universe would a bookshop have an author signing without having the books in stock? But I had to remind myself that these were people who didn't normally visit a bookshop.Chris Ryan's fans were more obliging with their wallets and it was great to see how much they enjoyed the event. As for Chris himself, he was a gentleman and it was hard to imagine that this shy, softly-spoken man was a former SAS soldier.I searched on Google images to get a photo of Chris Ryan, but it gave me several options:Even in the 1970's, I'm sure that the SAS wouldn't permit thisHe's too baldHe doesn't look like a man who could kill with his bare handsThis is a Chris Ryan, but not the Chris RyanThis is the only Chris Ryan that I've met, although I'm quite happy to meet other Chris Ryans too."},

With his reasonant, public school drawl, he solemnly observed that 'It has now become obvious that in those years since 2001, the world has undergone a moral craaaash'. Hmm...He then went on to describe the advent of Al Qaeda as 'an attack that we don't understand and a hostility that we don't understand'. Well, I'm sorry Martin but I think that quite a few of us do understand the causes of Islamic terrorism, or horrorism as he irritatingly named it. In his broadcasts, Osam Bin Laden has made it pretty clear why he considers the United States and its allies legitimate targets for terrorist attacks. Surely it doesn't take a great leap of imagination to understand the appeal of fundamentalist Islam to young Muslims who feel disillutioned by today's consumer society. We can understand the causes of terrorism without endorsing its actions.After mentioning the erosion of civil liberties and the human rights abuses that followed 9/11, Amis commented 'I hope that we will regroup and maintain and refresh that moral superiority which I do believe to exist'. What does he actually mean by that? Sadly, the interview moved on to the subject of his new book before Amis could expand on some of his earlier generalisations.Amis has written eloquently on this subject in a recently published essay, so I can only assume that he was inhibited by the constraints of a five-minute radio interview. Either that, or he just wanted to get on with plugging the new book."},

{"title": "John Grisham and a stoat", "date": "Friday, September 22, 2006", "text": "Just when life seems predictable and mundane, bizarre sequences of events can happen out of the blue. For example, on a very dull, grey afternoon one February, I received a phone call inviting me to a reception for John Grisham that evening in the Harry Potter-like surroundings of the Middle Temple. When the call came I had been standing by a skip tearing up pieces of soggy cardboard wondering where my life had gone wrong. Four hours later I was drinking champagne under the watchful gaze of several Stuart monarchs in a medieval banqueting hall.Three hours after that, I was back in Sussex being followed home by a stoat.That is the beauty of bookselling. You can spend hours, days, weeks doing very dull things with boxes, forms and computers for very little money, but you know that at some point something extraordinary will happen. Perhaps Anthony Burgess will walk through the door (before he died, preferably), or maybe you'll find yourself recommending true crime titles to Jordan ('Cos me and Peter like to read a bit of true crime together when we're in bed').And of course, last but not least, there are the books.My top tip at the moment is Jose Saramago's 'Blindness'. Published by the wonderful Harvill, it is a compelling story set in an unnamed city where a plague has rendered the whole population completely blind. In theory the novel should be heavy going. There are no chapters, none of the characters are named (apart from a dog) and Saramago doesn't use speech marks, but after the first couple of pages I became so absorbed in the story I forgot about the unusual style.In Britain we don't usually expect literary authors to be gripping as well as deep, but Saramago succeeds on all fronts. In addition to writing a novel that is as exciting as anything I've ever read, he also asks the reader 'What is it to be human?'. For those of you who believe in the 'Dunkirk spirit', you may not like Saramago's answer."},

Haneke isn't your average film director. He didn't make a movie until he was 46, having devoted the first part of his adult life to studying philosophy and psychology at the University of Vienna, followed by working as a film critic, dramatist and director for the stage and television. In Haneke's own words: My films are intended as as polemical statements against the American 'barrel down' cinema and its disempowerment of the spectator.In 'Hidden' a successful middle-class  couple arrive home to find a supermarket carrier bag outside their doorstep. It contains several videotapes. They play one of the tapes and, seeing the front of their house, realise that someone has them under surveillance. More tapes follow, accompanied by threatening drawings done in the style of a child. Who is sending the tapes and, more importantly, why?'Hidden' is a compelling study of paranoia, guilt and retribution with a suspense that is worthy of Hitchcock. Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche are superb, but equal credit must also go to the supporting cast, particularly Maurice Benichout and Lester Makedonsky, who delivers a superb performance as the couple's teenage son.As for Haneke, he is true to his word and empowers the viewer with a tantalising (and sometimetimes infuriating) succession of hints and allusions that may or may not be true and by the end of the film, there are more questions than answers. This is the best film I've seen for a long time."},

{"title": "Restoration", "date": "Friday, September 08, 2006", "text": "For a few years I lived in a remote part of Welsh-speaking Wales, studying at the smallest university college in Britain. One day, during a trip to the local shops, an old man came up to me and started talking in Welsh. I apologised for not understanding him and asked him if he spoke English (apparently there are several thousand Welsh speakers in Wales who can't speak English). 'Well the thing is, I've lost my tractor' he replied. 'I came into town for market day and now I can't remember where I've parked it. I don't know what I'm going to do.' I wasn't sure what I could do, but he seemed so old and vulnerable that I felt that I had to help him somehow.As we walked along the road in pursuit of the missing tractor, the farmer turned to me and said 'You're young. I've got one piece of advice for you.' I waited with bated breath for some piece of life-changing wisdom. 'On the back of a photo, always write the date and names of the people. I've got hundreds of old photographs and I don't know who they're of or when they were taken.' I listened politely, but didn't really take him seriously. A few minutes later we bumped into a friend of his whose expression suggested that this wasn't the first time the tractor had been lost. As we bid each other goodbye, the farmer said 'Remember. Always write the names and dates on your photographs. Diolch yn fawr.'I never thought about the farmer's words again until last year, when my father died and I discovered boxes full of photos of people I didn't recognise and places I'd never been to. I managed to work out who some of the people were, but there were some who would remain a mystery. Death is so bloody final.I found one badly damaged photo of a group of soldiers in the First World War and was about to chuck it in the box of unknowns when I realised that one of the men was my grandfather.It was sad to see the photo in such poor condition, so I scanned it and cleaned up the image, courtesy of Photoshop. I'm quiet pleased with the result:My grandfather is standing at the back, third from the right and must have been a teenager when the picture was taken. During his time at the Front, he would be shot at, gassed and endure hardships that I can only begin to imagine. He joined the army before he had a chance to learn a trade and was never able to achieve his potential,  but thanks to his tenacity and determination, Grandad was never out of work.Grandad was a Cockney 'rough diamond'. He was not an educated man, but gained the respect of others through his honesty and capcity for hard work. At one point he worked on the London Underground and fell on an electric line. He suffered from severe burns but in the 'good old days' he wasn't entitled to paid sick leave and had to take his two-week annual holiday to attend a burns unit. He found a hospital on the coast and took his wife and sons with him so that they could enjoy the seaside whilst he recovered.During the Second World War he joined the Home Guard. I have no idea how he managed to find the time to do this as he was cycling a round trip of 26 miles a day to work, avoiding the potholes left by the previous night's air-raid.  When I sometimes complain about my drive to work I think of Grandad, cycling from Twickenham to Edmonton in the middle of winter and I feel humbled by his example.But I digress. Returning to the Welsh hill farmer, I am going to belatedly take his advice. I haven't lived long enough to forget the people and places in my photos, but I have seen how frustrating it is to be confronted with a box full of unmarked pictures of people who might or might not be your great-grandparents. I'll start doing it now."},
{"title": "Doctor Who - the Gay Connection", "date": "Thursday, September 07, 2006", "text": "Yesterday my six-year-old son came home with the latest Doctor Who comic. It comes out every two weeks and it's clear that the production team struggle to come up with new ideas and usually rehash the same photos every third or fourth issue. Luckily, because childhood seems like an eternity, my son never seems to remember.This issue featured the usual assortment of monsters, but there was one radical departure in the form of a comic strip entitled 'The Battle of Reading Gaol'. As soon as I saw the title I did a double-take. It couldn't be, could it? But yes, it was all about Oscar Wilde.Someone at Doctor Who Comic must have have decided to have a bit of fun and the result is a brilliantly wicked story that must have gone over the heads of 99% of its readers.Reading my son's comic, I remembered how many gay people I'd met who loved Doctor Who. I once went to a party where everyone had to dress as a character from Doctor Who and I dutifully turned up in costume. The party was in full swing when I arrived, with several Doctors, the Brigadier and a variety of aliens dancing very energetically. I couldn't dance in my costume and decided to move into the garden where I was confronted with the unusual spectacle of seeing two Doctor Whos (William Hartnell and John Pertwee) snogging passionately. It was a rather surreal image.At this point I realised that the lack of women and choice of music (Sylvester's 'You Make Me Feel Mighty Real') pointed to the fact that this was a very gay affair. I was fascinated. I had always assumed that Doctor Who fans were spotty, heterosexual males who lived with their mothers, but here was  whole new subculture that I knew nothing about.I decided to ask William Hartnell, once he had stopped kissing John Pertwee, why Doctor Who appealed so much. It was, he said, a mixture of things, but it was mainly the fact that here was a hero who wore crushed velvet jackets with frilly shirts, avoided fights and didn't have a girlfriend. He also confessed that he first knew that he was gay when he saw a cyberman at the age of five ('Ooh, they were just so dominant')!It all made sense and when, over ten years later, the man who wrote the groundbreaking gay drama series Queer as Folk was chosen to revive Doctor Who, I knew that the franchise would be in good hands."},
{"title": "To the North", "date": "Thursday, August 31, 2006", "text": "A few months ago I decided to get away from it all and go to Iceland. The remoteness, low population density and proliferation of volcanoes, geysers and thermal springs appealed, as did the bizarre Viking sagas of blood feuds and retribution. Bugger the south of France.I had an enjoyable week driving along deserted roads, getting stuck up mountains and paying £5 for a pint of beer and whilst my trip wasn't the stuff of legend, I thought it would be worth mentioning to people.The following week people asked me what I'd been up to and I replied that I'd been to Iceland. They looked bemused, slightly uncomfortable and occasionally mildly contemptuous. I couldn't understand why. I know that most of us are generally well-travelled these days and a trip abroad no longer has the kudos it might have had, but surely my journey to Iceland didn't warrant such a hostile response.A week later I solved the mystery. People had thought that I was telling them that I had been to a branch of the Iceland supermarket chain and wondered why I thought it was worth mentioning. I corrected them and started to describe the amazing landscape and the fact that it was still light at midnight, but they still didn't seem convinced.One of the things that appealed to me most of all was the idea of being in an landscape that hadn't been damaged by people, where the air was clean and the water was so pure that you could drink from a stream (which I did and it was the best water I've ever tasted). It was therefore quite a shock to read that Iceland is one of the most ecologically damaged environments in Europe.In Jared Diamond's excellent book \"Collapse\" he explains how the first Viking settlers were struck by the similarities between the Icelandic landscape and their homeland. There were abundant forests, rolling pastures and a plentiful supply of fresh water. They could hardly believe their luck. Unfortunately the similarities were only superficial, as the Vikings soon discovered. In Norway, the Vikings had been used to a deep, rich soil and had no reason to assume that Iceland should be any different, but beneath the tufts of grass lay a soil composed of fine, volcanic ash. When the sheep and cows ate the grass, the ash became exposed and was blown away by the harsh winds of the north leaving a barren outcrop of volcanic rock.At the beginning of the 10th century, large parts of Iceland were covered in dense forest and the Vikings assumed that they'd have an abundant supply of wood for building and heating. However, as with the pasture, every time a plant was removed the soil literally vanished into thin air and it was almost impossible to grow anything new.Within less than a century Icelandic society was on the brink of collapse. The forests had almost gone and the Vikings struggled to find suitable pasture for their animals. They could have descended into anarchy, fighting over the last remaining scraps of land, but instead they did an amazing thing - they held a conference.The leaders of Iceland's settlements accepted that their farming practices had almost destroyed the ecosystem and together they agreed on a way of living sustainably, managing the land so that it could support future generations. It is a huge tribute to these early settlers that their descendants are flourishing over a thousand years on."},

Instead it looks like this...And as if that isn't enough, we've lost a planet too. As from this week, Pluto has been stripped of its status as a planet because it's too small and dull. Apparently, astronomers have discovered lots of other small, dull rocks orbiting the Sun and rather than have to go through the hassle of finding names for them, they thought that it would be easier to downgrade everything under a certain size to 'dwarf planet' status. Why couldn't they have included Mercury too? I've never liked it.I've just watched a film called 'By Dawn's Early Light'. It was made in 1990 and stars Martin 'Space 1999' Landau and James Earl Jones, amongst others and if you can turn a blind eye to the Hollywood gloss and slightly stereotyped characters, it is a superb film. So good, that I can't understand why I've never heard of it. I may not be Barry Norman but I've heard of most movies, good and bad and as far as I can tell, this one hasn't been on television and the DVD is only available intermittently. So what's so good about it?The plot is straightforward enough. During the last year of the Soviet Union's existence a separatist group get hold of an atomic weapon and detonate it, setting a chain of events into motion that threaten to lead to a full-scale nuclear war between NATO and the USSR. What's so brilliant about the film is its terrifying plausibility.Today we live in a climate of hysteria about terrorist attacks and WMD's, but until the end of the Cold War we faced the far more terrifying prospect of a nuclear holocaust. Yes, it didn't happen because common sense prevailed, but archives show that there were plenty of hawks on both sides of the Iron Curtain who were prepared to contemplate nuclear war. Even more depressingly, many civilians agreed. In a 1985 survey, 8 out of 10 Americans said that they'd rather be dead than red. So much for 'Where there's life there's hope'.'By Dawn's Early Light' is a chilling glimpse of what could have happened if the more psychotic elements in the American military had assumed power during an international crisis and the result is far more terrifying than any horror film I've seen. If you want to be scared out of your wits, try this movie."},
{"title": "The controversial Mr Scott Pack", "date": "Wednesday, August 23, 2006", "text": "In the drab, utilitarian head office of Waterstone's - the largest bookshop chain in Britain - a man with an equally drab, utilitarian name - Scott Pack - reigned like a despotic medieval monarch, possessing the power of life or death over the latest works of fiction. Publishers would nervously make their way up to Pack's office knowing that if he gave any of their authors the thumbs down, then they might as well cancel the print run. When a takeover of Ottakar's - the second largest chain in Britain - was mooted, the publishing world quaked in its boots.Articles like this one appeared in the press and suddenly Scott Pack went from being an unknown buyer in a retail chain to become the most controversial figure in the publishing industry. Pack, it was claimed by many, would 'dumb down' bookselling and replace range and diversity with a limited selection of bestsellers.This was largely nonsense and there are several obscure authors who have succeeded against the odds thanks to Pack's support, as this link will testify.Pack is no longer at Waterstone's and now works in publishing. I have just seen his blog www.thefridayproject.co.uk/pack/which is one of the best I've come across. He comes across as someone who is passionate about books, but doesn't take himself too seriously. There is a enjoyable rant about the author Norman Lebecht and a wonderful entry about a visit to a second-hand bookshop.It is worth visiting Pack's blog just to read an anecdote about David Tomlinson, the actor who played the fake magician in Bedknobs and Broomsticks."},
{"title": "I am confused", "date": "Saturday, August 19, 2006", "text": "I have always been against nuclear power. Although it may be a safe and clean source of energy 99.9% of the time, incidents like Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island give a terrifying glimpse of nuclear energy's potential to harm human life. Also, there is the very serious problem of nuclear waste, much of which will remain toxic to human life for at least 100,000 years. Atomic energy may be relatively clean, but it seems a very high price to pay for zero carbon emissions.Like most people, I prefer the idea of a future in which our power comes from a mix of energy conservation and sustainable sources of electricity, including wind turbines, tidal power and solar energy. However, the grandfather of the Gaia movement, James Lovelock, believes that unless we  build more nuclear power stations, we're buggered.When I first read about Lovelock's change of heart in a newspaper article, I was appalled. However, now that I have read his latest book The Revenge of Gaia, I feel increasingly convinced by the power of his argument. In short, Lovelock argues that climate change has already begun and there is nothing we can do to stop it. The world will become a hotter, more hostile environment, sea levels will rise and food supplies will dwindle. In the face of these changes, Lovelock argues that the best that we can hope for is an 'organised retreat' during the course of the 21st century. Instead of descending into a state of anarchy as essential supplies diminish, we have an opportunity to try and anticipate the problems ahead and prepare. By managing population growth, food production and our infrastructure, we can mitigate the worst effects of climate change.The key to survival, in Lovelock's view, is sustainability and part of that equation is nuclear power. Lovelock believes that alternative energy sources will never generate enough megawatts to replace today's carbon emitting  power stations, so we must accept that out of all the energy sources available, nuclear is the best option. It is reliable, clean and, most important of all, provides us with a source of energy that is not dependent on fluctuations on the stock market. In Lovelock's view, nuclear fission power isn't the answer, but it is a temporary solution until the safe alternative of nuclear fusion power is ready.I feel confused because although I am strongly opposed to nuclear energy, Lovelock's argments are very persuasive. What is the greatest threat to our future? A miniscule chance of radiation leak at a power station, or being dependent on other countries for our power? We have already seen how oil dependence can affect American and British foreign policy.Ideally, I would like to see every home and business become responsible for their own power supply through a combination of wind and solar power complemented by energy saving measures. However, it is unlikely that all of our energy demands could be met this way and if I had to choose between Russian gas, Iranian oil and domestic nuclear power, I think that I would feel marginally more secure with the latter.Our government is now talking about building a new generation of nuclear power stations. I only hope that they see this as a last resort and continue to pursue renewable sources of energy."},
{"title": "My five-year plan...", "date": "Friday, August 18, 2006", "text": "I've just finished reading Emile Zola's 'The Fortune of the Rougon's'. It isn't a great book, but it's important because it explains the background to Zola's Rougon Macquart novels and introduces some of the most significant characters. I now intend to read all twenty novels in Zola's sequence and have checked to see which translations are the best.Amazingly, over half of the novels haven't been translated into English since the Victorian age and two are currently out of print! I know that the Rougon Macquart novels are of mixed quality, but surely the sequence as a whole is important enough to merit commissioning new translations for the backlist titles?I have given myself five years to read the whole  series.   That works out as one book every three months and will give me plenty of time to read other things."},
{"title": "I watched Sin City last night...", "date": "Friday, August 11, 2006", "text": "It was brilliant and as near to you could get to the graphic novel. Instead of turning a comic into a movie, they turned a movie into a comic and the result, thanks to CGI and the genius of Robert Rodriguez,  is visually stunning. There's a lot of violence, but it's comic book violence. People get showered with bullets, lose limbs and jump off skyscrapers, but still somehow live to fight another day.The cast were generally superb, but my favourite was Carla Gugino, for obvious reasons.This morning I looked her up on the internet and ended up finding this article: http://www.thefword.org.uk/reviews/2005/06/sin_cityIf you can't be bothered to read it, there is a damning review of the film by a 20-year-old student who complains that the film is 'a tedious round of one dimensional, patronised, possessed women'. It's a good article and argues its case very persuasively and I ended up feeling a bit chastened for enjoying looking at so many scantily-clad chicks with guns. All I can say is that everyone in the film is one (or rather two)  dimensional, in keeping with the film's origins and the men are just as stereotyped as the women. The only difference is that they keep their clothes on.I think Sin City would be more offensive if it purported to be remotely realistic, but the whole point of the film is that it is turning live actors into comic book characters."},

{"title": "The world turns...", "date": "Friday, August 11, 2006", "text": "During one hot summer in my childhood, our house became infested with ants. I spent many hours gleefully bombarding their nests with boiling water and when that failed we turned to chemicals. But however many ants we killed, the next day they would reappear without fail.Then one day I read in a book that the best way to get rid of ants was to stop them wanting to come in  your house. I knew that ants liked sugar, so I sprayed a solution of harmless salt water around the cracks. They never bothered us again.Perhaps the Israelis and Americans would do well to adopt this method instead of thinking that they can bomb their way to a solution. I know that innocent Israeli lives have been lost, but does that justify killing ordinary Lebanese people? Some blogs have been depressingly bellicose in their response to recent events. I'm not surprised. Military superiority breeds an arrogance in which the killing of civilians becomes 'collateral damage' and this naturally creates a climate of desperation in which a small but significant number of people will be convinced that terrorism is their only weapon.Terrorists are like the ants - powerless as individuals, but collectively they are a force to be reckoned with and are impossible to eradicate by force. If you don't agree look at the ETA in Spain and the IRA in Northern Ireland. The British Army is generally regarded as one of the best in the world, but they were unable to stop terrorists in Ulster.So what should we do? Give in to the the people described by George Bush as 'Islamic fascists'? Of course not. They do not represent Islam, but their very existence is proof of the desperation that some people in the muslim world feel. Let's not forget that Islam has also been a religion of enlightenment and tolerance. We must remember that Jews and Christians were tolerated in the muslim world for over a thousand years and this only came to an end when Israel was founded.We need to ask ourselves why so many ordinary people are turning to murder. Look at the 9/11 bombers. Look at the average suicide bomber. As much as we like to persuade ourselves that they were evil, they weren't. They worked, studied hard and were nice to their families and neighbours and yet they were capable of such an appalling and immoral act. Why? How can we stop this seemingly unstoppable slide into an age of  terror and anarchy?There is no easy solution, but we should begin with achieving a lasting settlement in the Middle East. Israel must return to its pre-1967 borders in return for a cessation of hostilities and it should create a society in which Arabs are not second-class citizens. As for the West, we should leave the Middle East alone. We have lost the moral high ground and everything we do seems to alienate even more people. Let's get our own house in order before we put the world to rights."}
