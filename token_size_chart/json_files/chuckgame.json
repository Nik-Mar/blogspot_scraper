{"title": "Using Heptarchy Map (Diplomacy Variant) for a SAGA Campaign", "date": "Friday, November 11, 2022", "text": "Over the years, I have used Diplomacy maps (especially variant maps) for a number of different wargaming purposes.  Many years ago, I ran a very fun 9 player campaign using Hordes of the Things for tactical battles, and the Diplomacy variant map, Bretwalda for the campaign map.  That map, and the Diplomacy rules for it were written by Geoff Bache.  Geoff also write another British Isles Dark Ages variant, named Heptarchy IV which features 7 kingdoms.  Those kingdoms are listed here:AngliaCornubiaIrelandMerciaNorthumbriaScotlandWalesEach of these starts the campaign with 3 military units (which may be armies or fleets), except for Mercia which starts with 4 units (but has the advantage of having the most neighboring kingdoms).Here is a simple framework set of rules for a campaign.  You may want to add more to this.  Each  kingdom writes orders for their units each turn.  There are two map move turns in a year (Spring and Fall) and one supply turn (Winter).   During Spring and Fall, a Map unit can have one of several orders -  Move, Stand, Support, Convoy, Convert.  If you give a unit a Move order, you list the Unit, and it's starting space, and the adjacent space you want to move to.  Armies can move from one Land space to an adjacent Land space.  Fleets can move from one Sea or Coast space to an adjacent Sea or Coast space       If you give a unit a Stand order, you give the unit, and it's province, and it stays there this turn.  If you are next to a space that another unit (yours or an ally) is either Standing in, or next to a space that the other unit is Moving into, then you can give a Support order.  You list your unit, the province it is in, and the space (and unit) you are supporting.  A fleet can be given a Convoy order - it stays in the space it is in.  If that space is next to a friendly Army unit that has a Stand order, then the Fleet can move that Army unit to another coastal area that the Fleet unit is adjacent to.  Example - if there is a Scottish Fleet in the North Channel, and a Scottish Army in Stanraer, then the Scottish Fleet can be given a Convoy order, to move the Scottish Army from Stanraer to Belfast.  Note, the Scottish army at Stanraer cannot be given any order other than Stand.  If you issue a Convoy order to move an army unit belonging to another player, then the other player must Authorize the move.   Convert - you may give a unit a Convert order, if it is in a coastal province that has a city.  An Army unit may Convert to a Fleet, and a Fleet may convert to an Army.  All orders are written simultaneously, and turned into the Judge, but the judge interprets the order, one nation at a time, in the order printed on the Northeast corner of the map.  If a unit is given a Move, or Convoy order into a province with another player's Unit, then the moving or convoying unit must either retreat back to where they came from, or there is a battle.  Battles are always fought with 6 point Saga armies.  That is true for both Fleet and Army units fighting on land.  For each unit that has a Support order into a space where you are fighting, you may add 2 points to your Saga army total.  Rules for naval conflict must be devised, but just an opposed dice roll is good enough.  A unit that fights a battle and loses must retreat to an adjacent space to where the battle was fought (note, if the battle is fought, then the loser can choose any adjacent space to retreat to - this is different than if the unit retreats immediately before the battle).  Spring orders are followed by Spring adjudication and battles.Fall orders are followed by Fall adjudication and battles.  Winter is no move.  Instead, count all the cities that you still control (if you controlled it last Winter, then you still control it, unless there is an Enemy unit there).  At that point, make a note of the total cities you control.  You should have that many Map units.  If you need to add new Map units, they can only start at Home cities.  If you need to destroy excess Map units, they can be destroyed anywhere.     If you try this, please let me know the results.Thanks!"},
{"title": "NT Rules: Ancient Army Lists V - Crusades", "date": "Sunday, January 31, 2021", "text": "Let me first start out by saying that the title for this series - the Ancient Army Lists (for Niel Thomas' rules from Wargaming: An Introduction) is a bit of misnomer for this particular entrance in the series.  By this point in his timeline, Thomas has moved on from the ancient world, into the firm middle of the Medieval world.  The armies covered here are those involved in the middle and later Crusading period.As a reminder, the earlier articles in the series are:NT Rules: Ancient WargamingNT Rules: Ancient Army Lists I - Persian InvasionNT Rules: Ancient Army Lists II - Alexander the Great NT Rules: Ancient Army Lists III - The Punic WarsNT Rules: Ancient Army Lists IV - Imperial Rome  As I pointed out in some of the earlier articles, there are many additional lists for each of those periods covered in the longer, and more complete, treatment on the topic in Thomas' book dedicated to this period - Ancient and Medieval Wargaming.  Those rules have a little more to them, and a little more nuance, than the rules in the Introduction book.  Having said that, in many cases the army lists will transport to the earlier book.  What is different, is the grouping of the periods.  In his more advanced book, Thomas, for instance, groups what are here list periods I, II, and III into one chapter, entitled the Classical Period.  The army lists covered here from the Introductory book are present, with additions of other armies from the period such as Parthians and Numidians.What is interesting, however, is that the army lists from the Introductory book jump from the Imperial Rome period, all they way up to a thousand years later, into the Later Crusades.  Absent are Late Antiquity, the Early Medieval period (or Dark Ages), and of course the Viking Age, if you choose to interject such between Early and High medieval periods.  There are some fascinating armies and wargaming possibilities covered in that millennium between Second century AD and Twelfth century AD.However, space in the Introduction book is limited, and perhaps a better choice of Medieval representation could not be made than to cover the Crusades - an iconic chapter of medieval warfare that is always popular.  Thomas skips a general introduction to this period (covering 1180AD - 1290AD), rather he chooses to get right into the first army list - the Later Crusader army.  This is representing the Western Europeans armies on crusade in the Levant, during the events generally thought of the Third through Sixth crusades.  This covers the battles of the Crusader states (Kingdom of Jerusalem, Principality of Antioch, etc.) as well as the battles between Richard the Lionheart and Saladin.  It continues to cover the armies of the west, up until the events of 1289 (Tripoli) and 1291 (Acre). Here is a list of the units in the Later Crusader army:Knights Templar (Heavy Cavalry, Extra-Heavy Armor, Fanatical) 0-1 unitKnights Hospitaller (Heavy Cavalry, Extra-Heavy Armor, Fanatical) 0-1 unitOther Knights (Heavy Cavalry, Extra Heavy Armor, Elite) 0-1 unitTurcopoles (Light Cavalry, Light Armor, Bow) 1-3 unitsInfantry (Mixed) 2-6 unitsThe Infantry is Mixed, and here that means that each 4 stand unit has 2 stands of Heavy Infantry (with Heavy Armor), and 2 stands of Heavy Archers (with Medium Armor and Crossbows).This army has two special rules associated with it:Fanatic units never have to check morale, but they may never withdraw from combat.Mixed units will always have the Heavy Infantry targeted first, until only Archers remain. The Later Crusader army is for the player that likes to charge his enemy, and stomp him into the dust.  Not that this will always work, but it is hard to envision the army being successful any other way.The army list that is presented as an opposition to the Later Crusaders, is the Saracen Army, which can represent the different armies of the region who were opposed to the Crusaders and their establishment of states and principalities (Saladin's Ayyubid Egyptian army, or the Fatimids, Khwarismians, or even the Mameluks).  This army is an interesting foil to the Later Crusader army.The Saracen player can choose his army from these units:Guard Cavalry (Heavy Cavalry, Medium Armor, Bow, Elite) 1-2 unitsHeavy Cavalry (Heavy Cavalry, Medium Armor, Bow) 1-2 unitsTurcomans (Light Cavalry, Light Armor, Bow) 1-2 unitsInfantry (Heavy Archers, Light Armor, Bow) 2-4 unitsThe general ruleset does not allow Heavy Cavalry to be armed with bow, however that and some other concerns are covered by special rules for this army:Saracen Heavy Cavalry may be equipped with BowSaracen Heavy Cavalry may move before they fireSaracen Heavy Cavalry are allowed to make a 180 degree turn (about face) any number of times during movementSaracen Heavy Archers move as Warband, however they fight and shoot as Heavy ArchersThis army allows for, and may demand, considerable more finesse than the Later Crusaders army.  Every unit is armed with a bow, which helps, however with the exception of a pair-up between Turcopoles and Turcomans, the Later Crusader has better armor, and often, better morale.A really interesting battle would be between a Fatimid army (this list) and a Sunni foe, such as the Ayyubid army (also this list). Finally, this section also introduces a third army.  The Mongols, which are according to the author fought just about everyone (including the forces represented by the Saracen list given here), except for the later Crusaders.  More about that below... The Mongol player has this army list to choose from:Guard Calvary (Heavy Cavalry, Bow, Heavy Armor, Elite) 0-1 unitCavalry (Heavy Cavalry, Bow, Light Armor, Elite) 1-3 unitsHorse Archers (Light Cavalry, Bow, Light Armor, Elite) 4-7 unitsThis is an all mounted force, unlike the Saracens which include infantry archers.  It will make for an interesting foe to fight the Saracens, and others.  The army, as presented in the book has a few special rules associated with it:Mongol Heavy Cavalry may be equipped with bowMongol Heavy Cavalry may move before they fireMongol Heavy Cavalry may make an about face (180 degrees) any number of times during their move, without penalty These of course are almost identical to the Saracen list of special rules, which is what makes them an especially worthy foe for the Saracens. The addition of the foot archers for the Saracens might make all the difference in the world, if the terrain is friendly.  However, if the terrain is mostly open, with little space for the Saracen infantry to have a rough spot (woods, rubble, etc) to anchor against, then they may be overrun by the Mongols.  It would be a good fight. One other way to fight the Mongols would be against a Northern Crusades army.  This is something, here, of my own inventing, but owes a lot to similar army lists in other games.  I would rework the Later Crusaders army list into a Northern Crusades army list as this:Teutonic Knights (Heavy Cavalry, Extra-Heavy Armor, Fanatical) 1-2 unitsGerman Knights (Heavy Cavalry, Extra Heavy Armor, Elite) 0-1 unitLithuanian Cavalry (Light Cavalry, Bow, Light Armor) 0-2 unitsSergeants (Heavy Cavalry, Heavy Armor) 1-3 unitsFoot Sergeants (Mixed) 2-4 unitsThe Foot Sergeant units are Mixed, and here that means that each 4 stand unit has 2 stands of Heavy Infantry (with Heavy Armor), and 2 stands of Heavy Archers (with Medium Armor and Crossbows).This army has two special rules associated with it:Fanatic units never have to check morale, but they may never withdraw from combat.Mixed units will always have the Heavy Infantry targeted first, until only Archers remain. This last army list could be a challenge to the Mongols.  It would still have a hard time in the battle, as the Teutonic Order did have a hard time vs the Mongols in history.  With the Fanatic Order knights, and the Elite other knights, this is an interesting mix of morale grades, but it would be very interesting (and fun) to field.  Maybe a playtest should come up soon..."},
{"title": "NT Rules: Ancient Army  Lists IV - Imperial Rome", "date": "Tuesday, January 12, 2021", "text": "The fourth period that Neil Thomas covers for his Ancient Warfare rules in Wargaming: An Introduction is focused on the Imperial Roman period, or as it is titled in the book, \"Imperium Romanum: 25 BC to AD 130\".  This covers the Roman army, following the Marian reforms (which took place during the Republic Period), and beginning in 25 BC with the rise of Augustus as the first Caesar of the Imperium.This period is focused on the wars between the Romans and their more northern Barbarians, the Germans and the Gauls.  The period starts, as stated, with Augustus, so after Julius Caesar\\\"s famous campaign in Gaul, however the army list looks very much like it could be used to represent Julius\\\" famous exploits.The book presents two army lists for this period, one representing the Romans, and one representing a norther Gallo-German Barbarian army.  The author presents the fact that at the scale of the rules, the differences between the two armies (Gauls, and Germans) are negligible.  Other rule sets, such as the classic WRG army lists, present differences in troop types, morale, training, weapons, and even fighting density (the Germans generally being in denser formations for most of the represented tribes).  Those rules (the WRG rules), however, have a much more tactical focus, than these, in terms of classifying the troops.  Here, Thomas has taken the approach similar to Phil Sabin in his works (such as Lost Battles) whereby ancient infantry is simply divided up into heavy infantry and light infantry (based on the fact that heavy infantry is expected to stand in the battle line).  One further distinction made, at least here, is with Warband, which are somewhat lesser heavy infantry, but also with the ability to fight well in rough terrain. The Roman army here is represented by the following units:Legionaries (heavy infantry, heavy armor, Elite) 3-6 unitsAuxiliary Infantry (warband, medium armor) 1-3 units Auxiliary Archers (light infantry, bow, light armor) 0-1 unitArtillery 0-1 unit Auxiliary Cavalry (heavy cavalry, medium armor, Elite) 1-2 unitsThe Roman player is then presented with fielding a battle line of Legion units, with a few support choices.  The Elite cavalry is nice, possibly representing mercenary or foederati tribal cavalry, but with better equipment (hence the medium armor).  But, it is not present in sufficient numbers to deliver a winning battle, only a supporting role.  This leaves the Roman player in the enviable position of playing an archetypical Roman battle plan - a steady onslaught of well equipped, well trained infantry. The Barbarian army is composed of the following units and availability:Warriors (warband, light armor ) 3-6 unitsSkirmishes (light infantry, javelin, light armor, levy) 1-2 unitsArchers (light infantry, bow, light armor, levy) 0-1 unitChief’s Bodyguard (warband, light armor, Elite) 0-1 unitCavalry (heavy cavalry, light armor, Elite) 1-3 unitsThe Barbarian player is faced with the fact that his army is outclassed, as in real life. He must rely on a ruse de guerre or clever use of rough terrain, in order to balance the odds.Several options exist for a more balanced game. First, the Barbarian player may be given either a few additional units, or additional rough terrain.  Second, the Barbarian warband units can be made larger (6 stands), this is what the Tactica rules do.  Third, battles could be fought as part of a campaign, or series of games, with the Romans having a more difficult time of recovering losses between battles.  I had an article in Yaah! magazine featuring such a campaign for Commands and Colors, it would work with these rules, as well.There are many other possible army lists available for this time period, some of which are in Thomas’ longer book on Ancient and Medieval Wargaming, but here these are the only two.  Satisfying games could be fought with Roman v. Roman, as a civil war or rebellious province scenario. Equally, a war between two Barbarian tribes might be fun.For fun, and to recreate a British Barbarian army, replace the Cavalry and Chief’s Bodyguard units with Light Chariots (make one of them Elite). That should give a satisfying Boudicca’s revolt feel.I got some nice Christmas loot from very fine people who were nice enough to gift me.  I used part of it to order some books, and one of them is the Spanish Armada book by Peter Dennis.  This is a period I am interested in, but will probably never build models for, so using paper ships works fine for me. The book also has a nice bit of introductory history, some paper modeling tips, and a set of wargaming rules.The ships can be put together with simple rectangular backgrounds, if you want to build them fast, or you can trim the white away, and have nicer looking models (the picture below was pasted to the Facebook Paperboys group, by Peter Dennis himself, showing the models trimmed nicely).If I get to these in 2021, and do a game, I will post pictures. Also a review of the rules is coming.  There are a bunch of books in the Paper Soldiers Series, including many on land campaigns, and at least one more naval book - on Trafalgar.  It might be on my list, after all I still have some Christmas loot. Update (2022) - WOFUN now manufactures these ships available as lovely plastic standee models, that look very durable and you don't have to cut them out.  These are on my to-be-purchased list. Here is a link to the appropriate catalog section of Raven Banner games, describing these Spanish Armada products from WOFUN."},
{"title": "19th Century Imaginations during the pandemic", "date": "Saturday, November 28, 2020", "text": "One thing I have been working on, during the pandemic, has been the gathering of a large collection of 15mm figures related to the Russian forces of the Russo-Turkish war of 1878-79.This includes Russian units, and also Bulgarian and Romanian.  Eventually, I would like to also do a similar sized force representing the Turkish forces, but in the meantime I am playing around with some Imaginations ideas for gaming.  That leaves with considering different fictional match ups.in the past, my 19th century imaginary foes were the Margravate of Furstenberg, and the Cantons of Rumpwhistle. In 28mm, I would use ACW union troops for Furstenberg and Confederates for Rumpwhistle. I also introduced a third, relatively neutral nation based on Danish forces - the Kingdom of Elsinore.  Sadly, I sold off those 28mm figures, but I retain the fictional navies that I built.Now that I am switching gears to 15mm, I can resurrect the army of Furstenberg, based on my Mexican-American war U.S. troops.  Rumpwhistle is out of luck in this conflict, except as a naval power (I can use my Spanish American war Spanish forces as Rumpwhistle colonial troops).  The new nation will likely be the over extended Romani-Bombastia Empire (Romani for short).In the west, Romani has hegemony over several client states (notably Vulgaria, and Bromania).  Both are home to ethnic Romani peoples, and border Furstenberg and several smaller Balkanized states.  Howeve, in the vast eastern hinterlands of Romani, there are border skirmishes the Chow Empire of the Jade Dragon in the north, and the dangerous mountain regions of Boruckistan in the south.  The Romani Emperors have long sought after control of seaports on the Chow Sea, but those are also contested by naval and colonial forces from Furstenberg, Rumpwhistle and other nations.This will give me plenty of scope for all sorts of fictional conflicts, using figures I already have, as well as naval actions.  The trick will be devising rules and games that will reward solo play, and in a small battle space.Pictures of troops and notional maps will follow.  I hope to post a battle report soon."},
{"title": "Battle of Strasbourg - a committee game", "date": "Saturday, May 16, 2020", "text": "In order to make up some gaming time, while the whole world is shut down in a semi-quarantine state due to the Novel Corona Virus pandemic, I hosted and refereed a committee game based on the battle of Strasbourg, 357AD, where Caesar Julian (and a council of advisors) decided what to do in response to King Chnodomar, head of a Germanic horde (Franci, Burgundi, and Alamanni), crossing the Rhine river (at Argentoratum - modern day Strasbourg) into Gaul.Below are the briefings, maps, etc, that I provided the players.From the Battle of Strasbourg Wikipedia pageJulian - You are Caesar Julian responsible for the defence of Gaul.  You are new to military command and it is very important that you make a name for yourself with the troops and increase your reputation.  The Emperor Constantius has been successfully campaigning in the East.  He is jealous of you and has been undermining everything you have tried to do.  He has said that you are not capable of dealing with such a military problem as this and consequently has dispatched troops under one of his generals (Richomer) to deal with the barbarian incursion.  You have to decide whether you will wait for Constantius (and his main army), thereby risking losing credibility in the eyes of your soldiers, or attack now and secure fame for yourself.You were raised in a Greek speaking household, and spent your youth at schools in Athens.  You were raised as a Christian, but your study of the ancient philosophers has convinced you that it would be better for the empire if it returned to it's Pagan Roman roots.  This position is not always popular with the men.Your inclination is to attack now before Constantius' troops come and take all the glory.  But being a prudent man, you have called a council of your senior officers to ask their advice.  After you have listened all you want (at least three game turns), you will make your decision.  Remember, the only thing worse than losing glory to Constantius, would be to fight on your own, and lose.What you know about your council:Sebastian - Your best officer, although a German by birth.  One of the best officers in the Roman army.  An excellent tactician and very popular with the troops.  He has recently replace Trajan as Master of Infantry.Victor - A Sarmatian by birth.  He is known for his cautious approach.  He is the Master of Cavalry.  He is responsible for scouting reports.Richomer - Master of Offices.  German born.  He commands the Household Guard of Emperor Constantius, who have arrived to assist you.  He has come with a message telling you in part to share the danger and to not rashly commit yourself to the risks of decisive action, single handedly.Trajan - Former Master of Infantry.  Born in Rome, proud of being a true Latin.  You had him replaced by Sebastian because Trajan is lazy, incompetent, and he was very critical of you in front of the men.  He is dangerous and probably has his own eye on the throne.  Be careful.  However, he has friends in the court of Constantius.Equitius - A kinsman of yours, and Marshal of the Court (the Court of Constantinople, the capitol of the Empire).  He has a high sense of honour and you respect him.  Just like you he is very respectful of the old ways, and has high regard for the Senate.  He is the highest ranking Civillian Official present in all of Gaul, second only to you in most matters.  But he is a civillian without a military appreciation for things.Potentius - A very highly regarded junior officer.  The young soldiers like him, the old soldiers respect him.  He is going to achieve great things.  He is the son of the former Caesar of the West, but you were not responsible for assasinating your predecessor.  You don't think Potentius has any ill will towards you.Sebastian - You were born a German, but have been a loyal Roman soldier your whole life.  You are Master of Infantry of Julian's army (the field army of the Western Provinces).  The only infantry you do not command, are the garrison troops of the fortresses.  You are a capable, seasoned officer and very popular with the troops.  You are without a doubt the best commander on Julian's staff and what you say carries a lot of weight.  Many of the junior officers will support you, whatever you say.  Trajan is your enemy, as he was the previous Master of Infantry, but was removed from office by Julian and replaced by you.  He has connections with Constantius, however, so Julian retains him as a senior officer.You, like many of your men, are a Christian.  You have nothing against Romans of other religions, but the one difference you have with Julian, is he wants to return back to the older Roman pagan ways.Your aim is to get Julian to attack the barbarians now.  If he does, you will probably gain a great deal of credit for victory, as it is well known that you are his best general.  If he waits, Constantius' generals will certainly steal the glory.What you know about the council:Victor  - A Sarmatian by birth.  Master of the Cavalry.  Cautious.  He is very beloved by his horsemen, mostly because he kept all of them alive during the recent civil war.  He is very protective of his cavalry, but is still a good commander in battle.Richomer  - Master of Offices.  German born.  He commands the Household Guard of Emperor Constantius.  A very good officer, with very good troops.  Trajan  - Former Master of Infantry.  Born in Rome, proud of being a true Latin.  He hates you, you took his job.  He was not very good at his job, but blames Julian and You for losing it.  Be careful.  However, he has friends in the court of Constantius.Equitius  - Marshal of the Court (the Court of Constantinople, the capitol of the Empire).  He is distantly related to Julian.  Very important, but not to the army.Potentius - A very highly regarded junior officer.  He is the son of the former Caesar of the West.  You like him, but do not know where his loyalties are.Victor - You were born a Sarmatian, but you have been a loyal Roman soldier your whole life.  You are Master of Cavalry and equal in rank with Sebastian.  Together you are the senior army commanders, although Trajan is along, out of respect.  You don't like this situation - you have spent the past decade very carefully keeping your cavalry alive and well, in spite of the bloody civil war fighting.  For that reason, many of them are seasoned veterans, and very loyal to you.  This coming fight that Sebastian and Julian are itching for will be very dangerous and could cost many lives.You, like many of your men, are a Christian.  You have nothing against Romans of other religions, but the one difference you have with Julian, is he wants to return back to the older Roman pagan ways.You are responsible for the border scouting along the Rhine river, and you think that the barbarians do not pose a pressing threat, and you would be better of waiting for reinforcements to make certain of victory.  Your aim is to convince Julian to wait.  If it is going to be a battle, your aim is to keep your cavalry safe.What you know about the council:Sebastian - A German by birth.  Master of the Infantry.  An excellent commander, and not afraid of a fight.  He is very loyal to Julian, and will see this battle as a way to make a name for the young Caesar.Richomer - Master of Offices.  He commands the Household Guard of Emperor Constantius.  A very good officer, with very good troops.  He was born a German.Trajan - Former Master of Infantry.  Born in Rome, and somewhat proud of being a true Latin.  He hates Sebastian, who took his job.  It is unsure what his feelings are towards Constantius.  He may not be the best battlefield commander.Equitius - Marshal of the Court (the Court of Constantinople, the capitol of the Empire).  He is distantly related to Julian.  Very important, but not to the army.Potentius - A very highly regarded junior officer.  He is the son of the former Caesar of the West.  You like him, but do not know where his loyalties are.Richomer - You were born a German, but have been a loyal Roman your whole life.  You are Master of Officers, the commander of the Imperial Household Guard, sent by the Emperor Constantius to tell Julian that he should wait for reinforcements.Personally, you think Constantius is just jealous of Julian as the barbarians don't seem so strong.  For political reasons you must convey Constantius' message and be cautious of contradicting him.  Your aim is to give Julian the best advice you can without damaging your standing with Constantius.  If there is to be a battle, your 2,000 household guards are the best troops in Julian's army.What you know about the council:Sebastian - Master of Infantry for Julian.  A very good commander.  Maybe the best in Gaul.  He was born a German.Victor - Master of Cavalry for Julian.  Cautious, but good.  Has miraculously kept his cavalry alive during the recent, bloody civil wars.  He was born a Sarmatian.Trajan- A senior officer.  You don't know much about him.  He was born in Rome, a true Latin.Equitius - Marshal of the Court (the Court of Constantinople, the capitol of the Empire).  Supportive of the government, and that means the Emperor.  But you don't think he cares which Emperor.Potentius - A very highly regarded junior officer.  You don't know why he is in the council, but he is likable.Trajan -  You used to be the Commander of Infantry, until Constantius replaced the former Caesar of the West, with this young upstart Julian.  For some reason he doesn't like you, and replaced you with that popinjay Sebastian.  You have heard some ugly things about Sebastian's past, and when you spread rumors and spoke ill of him, you were replaced.  You were born in Rome, and represent one of the true Latins, who should hold all the real positions of power in the Empire.  Your aim is to discredit Sebastian.  You don't really care who gets credit for the battle, Julian or Constantius.  In battle you will not command the main battle line, but probably the secondary infantry (auxilliaries, archers, etc.)What you know about the rest of the council:Sebastian - You don't like him. A German by birth. He has your old job. Not fair.Victor - A good officer of Cavalry.  A Sarmatian by birth.  But what good has the Cavalry every done?  And he is a Sarmatian! Victor tried to stay out of the fight all during the civil wars, maybe he is a coward?Richomer - The officer of the Household Guard.  A German by birth.  Here on Constantius' orders.  Maybe if you work well with him, on Constantius orders you may replace Sebastian?Equitius  - A high ranking civilian.  He is a Greek by birth.  He controls the paychests of the soldiers, and also is very loyal to the capitol (Constantinople).Potentius - Another cavalry officer.  For some reason the other officers (Sebastian and Victor) like him.Equitius - You are Curator Palatii, Marshal of the Court.  You are the highest ranking official in Gaul, except for Caesar Julian.  Julian is a distant cousin.  You are Greek born.  You are a civilian with only limited military experience, however you control the paychests, and have been asked by Julian to keep the soldiers up to date on pay.  You are very conscious of your position and feel yourself above all this military riffraff, especially those who rose from the ranks of barbarians, like Sebastian, Richomer and Victor.  From your perspective, it seems more prudent to wait for reinforcements but you will advise whatever seems honourable for you to try and impress Julian.  You are very loyal to the capital at Constantinople, and to whomever is Emperor.  Is it possible that Julian will make a better Emperor than Constantius?  It might be good for the stability of the Empire to have a learned man in charge.What you know about the rest of the council:Sebastian: A senior officer, who was born as a German.  He is a good leader, or so the other military men tell you.Victor:  A senior officer, who was born as a Sarmatian.  Also a good leader, but you understand that he is very cautious.  His men are responsible for scouting, and may be useful to try to get parlay messages out to the German leaders.Trajan: A senior officer, who was born as a true Latin, in Rome.  He is currently out of favor, and was replaced by Sebastian in his job as leader of the Infantry.Richomer: You have had dealings with Richomer before.  Although he was born a German, he has a taste for the finer things in life.  But he is also a first rate military man.  He commands Constantius' household guard, and will be sure to keep an eye open for those who are loyal to the Emperor, and those who are loyal rather to Julian.  Be careful of him.Potentius: A young man.  Like all young men, he is more interested in women than he should be.  Perhaps that is a weakness?  The other military men like him, perhaps he shows promise that you just don't see.Potentius: You are a junior officer, but from a very noble family which adds weight to your opinion.  Your father was the previous Caesar of the West, however, he was kiled by his own men at the end of the recent Civil War.You have found a home in the army, and are a very skilled cavalry officer.  You hope to rise in the army, and want your record and achievements to recommend you to higher service in the Empire.  You admire successful senior officers like Sebastian and Victor.You want to attack now and get the battle over with.  If you wait for reinforcements, the barbarians might do untold damage.What you know about the council:Sebastian: A senior officer, commander of the Infantry.  Very responsible, and very talented.  Your father and his men spoke of Sebastian as if he were the best general in Gaul.Victor: Another senior officer, commander of the Cavalry. Also very responsible and beloved by his men.  The junior officers under him tell you that Victor is extremely popular with his men, because he kept them out of the recent Civil War battles, and kept most of them alive, when so many other Roman soldiers were killed on one side or the other.Trajan: A senior officer, but one you want to be like.  He has a reputation for being lazy and incompetent, but for some reason, he served on your Father's staff, as his master of Infantry.Equitius: A civilian.  He is very important at court, and is very loyal to the Empire.  You don't think he is a military man.  He seems to know many important women, and who knows?  A politically connected wife might be good for your military career.Richomer: Another legendary senior officer.  He is the Master of Offices for Emperor Constantius, that means he is the commander of the Emperor's Household Guards.  He has brought 2,000 elite guardsmen here to help Julian.  He also has brought messages from the Emperor. The idea for the game came from one of the Wargaming in History volumes - Goths, Huns and Romans by Simon McDowell.  As detailed in the book, the ideas for particulars in the scenario are based on Valens' battle of Adrianople, but using the terrain and historical persons from the Julian situation.  It was a lot of fun, and the players had a good time.  I think next time I try this, I will insert some more structure, as it was too easy for the more eager players to overshadow the less eager participants (that could have been a product of being online, though)."},
{"title": "NT Rules: Ancient Army Lists III - Punic Wars", "date": "Thursday, March 19, 2020", "text": "The third period of armies covered for the Ancient Warfare rules in the Wargaming: An Introduction book is the Punic Wars.  This is a great period of history to study, and also a great topic for wargaming, and these armies are interesting.  Neil Thomas handles it well, by presenting two versions of the armies, one for the main part of the campaigning when Hannibal was in Italy.  Then he gives a second set reflecting the battle of Zama where we start to see some brilliance on the Roman side. Hannibal was able to use his mixed army with great success for what I think are two reasons. First, he has a good mixture of forces at his control, and second he was a military genius.  Years ago, I read Tony Bath's Hannibal's Campaigns, which is perfectly written for a wargamer, taking care to detail the armies and battles very nicely. Another great source is Warfare in the Classical World by John Warry. Warry has an informative chapter on the Punic Wars, but really there are a ton of references and resources out there on this rich period.  Both books, and a library of others, can be found at Amazon.Thomas gives a good army list for Carthage, showing the variety of troops.  There are enough Infantry units to have a battle line, supported by elephants, and a variety of cavalry and skirmish infantry.1-3 units African Infantry (heavy infantry, light armor)      1-3 units Gauls/Spaniards (Warband, light armor)                1-2 units Skirmishers (light infantry, javelin, light armor, Levy)        0-2 units Elephants                          1-3 units Numidian Cavalry (light cavalry, javelin, light armor)     1-2 units Gallic/Spanish Cavalry (heavy cavalry, light armor, Elite) The Infantry units are respectable, and the elephants present a choice. They are a tough foe for the Romans, but since they are one stand units, they will crumble fast.  The skirmishers and Numidians are extremely useful, but won't win a battle on their own.  And the same goes for the Gallic horse.  This is a tough army to run since we aren't all Hannibal Barca, but it does present some problems for the Roman player.  The Roman army, however, makes up for a lack of diversity, by  having some heavier units.4-7 units Hastati and Principes (heavy infantry, medium armor)0-1 units Triarii (heavy infantry, heavy armor, Elite)       1-2 units Velites (light infantry, javelin, light armor)     0-1 units Roman Cavalry (heavy cavalry, medium armor)          The Velites will win man-to-man and unit-to-unit vs the Carthaginian skirmishers, if he can close. The Roman Cavalry will probably fare poorly vs the Gallic Cavalry.  That leaves the impressive battle line Infantry. Can they withstand both the elephants and the warband?  The triarii are a luxury item, but taking them leaves little room for support troops.  It comes down to a matchup pairing the discipline of Roman Infantry, vs Carthaginian finesse.As mentioned, there is a second version of each army(Carthage and Rome) representing the period of fighting where Rome grew much more aggressive, strategically.  This was under the command of Scipio, when he pushed the war out of Italy and back to North Africa.At this time, the Gauls were beginning to lose some faith in their Carthage allies, so the list represents a situation where the Gallic (or Spanish/Iberian) soldiery was still willing to fight for Carthage (promises of pay or booty), the Gallic/Spanish Cavalry is no longer available. Perhaps the Nobles sensed a futile effort? They were willing to fight in Europe (Italy), but reluctant to go to Africa?The second big change is that the majority of the Numidian now saw the situation as being allied to Rome, a better deal than Carthage.Finally, to reflect the hardening of some of the African Infantry, there are now some proper veterans n the army, fighting as an elite cadre.To reflect these changes, change the two cavalry lines on the Carthaginian army list, to the following three lines:0-1 units Numidian Cavalry (light Cavalry, javelin, light armor)0-1 units Carthaginian Citizen Cavalry (Heavy Cavalry, Medium Armor, Elite) 0-1 units Hannibal's veterans (heavy infantry, heavy armor, Elite)The Romans, after years of fighting Hannibal now have a different mix of troops, which includes their new comrades the Numidian, these changes occur.Reduce the number of Hastati and Prncipes units, to 3-6 units.Numidian Cavalry are now available (light cavalry, javelin, light armor) 1-3 unitsWith these changes, the later battles of the war can be fought."},
{"title": "NT Rules: Ancient Army Lists II - Alexander the Great", "date": "Friday, March 6, 2020", "text": "The second period of armies for the Ancient Warfare rules in Wargaming: An Introduction, covers the army of Alexander the Great, and his chief foe - Persia under Darius III.The army list in the book is listed as covering the period from 340-323BC.  Several of the major battles of the period are against the Persians - and indeed, the two army lists presented are for Macedonia (under Alexander), and the Achaemenid Empire (Persia, under Darius III).  There were other battles, other than against the Persians. In the beginning of the period, while Alexander is still just prince, under Phillip, he fights one of his most famous battles, Chaeronea (338BC). His foe at this engagement is a Greek style polis army, with Thebans and Athenians present.  In fact, the book suggests that for such an army, the Greek Army list from the previous period be used, with the modification that the hoplites be modified to having Medium Armor, instead of the Heavy Armor.The other adversaries that Alexander faces, that are not represented here in this article, include the Scythians (light horse archers, from the Black Sea area) at the battle of Jaxartes 329BC.  Also, the Indian army of the Pauravas at the battle of the Hydaspes 326BC.  Both of these armies would be fascinating to see, and they are represented in Neil Thomas' later, more detailed treatment of ancient warfare, in Ancient and Medieval Wargaming.Other than the battles listed above, the other non-Persian foes that Alexander faced, were always during sieges (and the campaign in the Swat valley region around the Khyber Pass - the battles fought against the locals were very one-sided).  And so armed with army lists for Alexander, and Darius, we can refight the famous battles of Granicus (334BC), Issus (333BC), and Gaugamala (331BC) and finally the battle of the Persian Gate (330BC).Alexander's refinement of the Macedonian war machine is a great evolution over the earlier Greek Polis Hoplite army.  Several equipment and technique improvements occurred, and rather than just having a static battle line, the army in the hands of the Macedonians (Phillip and Alexander, and Alexander's successors) becomes a very dynamic and aggressive tool.  This comes about with great numbers of cavalry (heavy such as the Companions, and light such as the Thessalians), and more reliance on light infantry.  With these adaptations, the army can use the phalanx (the battle line of pike, or sarissa, wielding heavy infantry) as a strong central anvil, and the cavalry and light infantry can harass the flanks of the enemy until they crumble under the push of the phalanx. Phalangites (Heavy Infantry with medium armor)                                3-5 unitsHypaspists (elite Heavy Infantry with medium armor)                         0-1 unitsAgrianians (Light infantry with javelin and light armor)                      1-2 unitsCretans (Light infantry with bow and light armor)                                0-1 unitsCompanions (elite Heavy Cavalry with light armor)                             1-2 unitsThessalians (elite Light Cavalry, with light armor and javelin)             0-1 unitsThe Hypaspists are the select, elite heavy infantry of the army.  They might be employed on one end of the Phalanx, and used for the \"killing blow\" against the enemy battle line.Two options allow the players to represent some non-standard historical theories.  The first allows the Hypaspists to be fielded as Warband rather than Heavy Infantry.   I'm not sure I agree, but it is there.  Second the Thessalians could be reclassed as Heavy Cavalry.  Against the army of Alexander, the army of Darius would face them multiple times (and many sieges).  This new Persian army differs from the model of Xerxes, 150 years earlier, now being based on a battle line that could be split between heavy archers, and heavy cavalry (which can make up more than half the army).  In an effort to face the Macedonian Phalanx, there are several examples of the Persians hiring Greek Mercenary heavy infantry.  These are good units, but not quite the level of the Phalanx.  In several of the battles under Darius III he would try to adopt a certain stratagem or element of surprise against the army of Alexander.  One of those is present in the army list - the Scythed Chariots.Persian Cavalry (Heavy Cavalry with light armor)                                         3-5 unitsPaphlagonian Cavalry (levy Light Cavalry with javelin and light armor)      1-2 unitsScythed Chariots                                                                                              0-1 unitKardakes (levy Heavy Archers with bow and light armor)                             2-4 unitsGreek Mercenary Hoplites (Heavy Infantry with medium armor)                  0-2 unitsWith a minimum of four mounted units, (up to a maximum of six units), this army will lead the player commanding it to trying some interesting maneuvers against the army of Alexander.  Standing in the battle line, even with Mercenary Hoplites making up the core, winged on both sides by Kardakes, would be a risky toss of the dice vs the Macedonian phalanx.Upon Alexander's death, the empire would of course be divided up into five successor states, and they would wage the wars of the Successor States on each other.  Each successor, or Diadochi, was a general or presumed family heirs of Alexander's.  These included Ptolemy, Cassander, Lysimachus, Seleucus and Epirus.   I would suggest, without resorting to the army lists and rules from Ancient and Medieval Warfare, that a generic Successor Army might look like this:Phalangites (Heavy Infantry with medium armor)                                3-4 unitsHypaspists (elite Heavy Infantry with medium armor)                         0-1 unitsAgrianians (Light infantry with javelin and light armor)                      1-2 unitsCretans (Light infantry with bow and light armor)                                0-1 unitsCompanions (elite Heavy Cavalry with light armor)                             1-2 unitsThessalians (elite Light Cavalry, with light armor and javelin)             0-1 unitsElephants                                                                                                0-2 units"},
{"title": "NT Rules: Ancient Army Lists I - Persian Invasion", "date": "Thursday, March 5, 2020", "text": "The Neil Thomas Ancient (and Medieval) rules that are found in his book Wargaming: An Introduction, were covered in a previous article on this blog.  This is an overview of the different army lists that are presented to go along with those rules.First, let me preface another one of Neil's publications, the great book on Ancient and Medieval Wargaming.  That book presents a more in-depth treatment and greater coverage (both in terms of years/periods served, as well as some more nuance in the rules).  It also divides up the whole period, as does the current ruleset in discussion here, into different time periods.  In the later book, however, each time period has more army lists than presented here.  So, when I speak of additional army lists here, or the idea for more troop types to be covered, presented - that is done in the latter version of the rules, to a certain extent.Supporting the current ruleset there are several tie periods, and two or three armies presented for each one of them, as examples.  Presumably, some clever gamers would take their knowledge of the period, plus the list of troop types in the rules, and could craft additional army lists for additional armies not covered in this introductory set of rules and lists.This is further reinforced by the fact that there are troop types in the rules, that don't exist in any of the army lists (for instance, as mentioned in the article on the rules themselves, Heavy Chariots don't appear in any of the sample army lists).Period 1The first time period covered in the chapter on Ancient Army Lists in this current book, is the period from 490-480BC, the Persian invasions of Greece.  For an excellent overview of the history of this incredible decade, see the article at the Ancient History Enclopedia.  These are the wars detailed by Herodotus in his volume, 'The Histories'.  This period offers up two armies, the Ancient Greek army, and the Persian army of Xerxes.  The only other information given for this time period is a suggestion that the tabletop have no more than 0-3 pieces of terrain, and that should be either woods, hills or rivers.The Ancient Greek Army here is a representation, for these rules, of what the army would look like on the Greek side at the battles of Marathon (490BC), Thermopylae (480BC), Mycale (479BC) or Plataea (479BC).  Marathon represented (according to Western history) the end of the first invasion by Persia.  The other battles were fought making up the land campaign of the second invasion by Persia.For those interested in this history of this extremely interesting war, please take a look at the major Naval engagements that made it up as well - the battles of Salamis and Artemisium in 479BC.The Greek army is of course built around a core battle line of Hoplites, supported by some other units.  Here is the breakdown:City Hoplites (4-7 units)Spartan Hoplites (0-2 units)Javalinmen (1-2 units)Cavalry (0-1 unit)The City Hoplites are heavy infantry, with heavy armor, and average morale.  The Spartans are the same, but with elite morale.The Javelinmen (Peltasts) are light infantry, with light army, and levy morale.  They are of course armed with javelins.  The Cavalry are light cavalry, with light armor, and javelins.  They are average morale.Between the javelinmen and the cavalry, these are the only missile troops in the army.  However, this army will win (or die) based on it's strong battle line of heavy infantry.This list well represents the Athens' heavy army at Marathon (the Spartans did not make it, because they had a religious ceremony to venerate before crossing Greece to the battle site).  It also represents the pan-Hellenic alliance at Platea.  If you wanted to do Thermopylae, I would suggest an army something like this:7 units of Spartan Hoplites (heavy infantry, heavy armor, elite morale)1 unit of Allied Hoplites (heavy infantry, heavy armor, average morale)The Ancient Persian army of Xerxes is also a good representation of the Persian Army, for these rules.  The army list grants the following troops:Heavy Archers (3-5 units)Levy Infantry (1-3 units)Immortals (0-1 unit)Persian Cavalry (1-2 units)Scythian Cavalry (0-1 unit)The Heavy Archers are the Persian core battleline units, however this army has a lot of different options.  The Archers are themselves Heavy Archer units, with bow and light armor and Average morale.The Levy Infantry are light infantry, with bow, light armor, and Levy morale.The Immortals are Heavy Archers, with bow and light armor, and Elite morale.The Persian Cavalry are Heavy Cavalry, armed with bow, light armor, and Average morale.The Scythian Cavalry are Light Cavalry, with bow, light armor, and Average morale.This whole army is armed with bows!!  The Greeks will definitely appreciate their Heavy Armor before this period is all over!  As Herodotus informs us, the Persians informed the Spartans, prior to the engagement at Thermopylae, that they have so many archers in their army, that the arrows would darken the skies.  To this, the Spartan reply was, Then we shall fight in the shade!!These armies will tend to show the warfare as (we think) it must have been during these engagements.  The Greek tendency to adopt the heavy infantry and heavy armor, from the many battles among the different Polis factions. Against this, the Persian reliance on archery is the nature of the contest.  It is a tough one.To play the Spartans against the army of Xerxes, the attitude of the Spartans is certainly helpful to adopt.  It is best summed up in the monument to the Spartan dead at Thermopylae:Go tell the Spartans, thou who passest by,That here, obedient to their laws, we lie."},
{"title": "NT Rules: Ancient Wargames", "date": "Wednesday, February 26, 2020", "text": "The first set of rules in the book Wargaming: An Introduction is called Ancient wargaming, but in fact it covers Armies and sub-periods ranging from the fifth century BC up through the Middle Ages.  As with the other rulesets in this book, this one is presented over three different chapters. The first chapter introduces the period, and discusses some of the peculiarities of warfare in this period. This discussion includes mention of the troop types, and also any peculiar formations or weapons.  The second chapter will present the rules for the period.  And the third chapter will present army lists.For the Ancient Wargaming set, the various troop types are these:Heavy Infantry - examples include Greek hoplites and Roman legionnairesHeavy Archers - examples include Persian Immortals, and English longbowmenWarband- examples given include Gallic warriors, and Roman AuxiliariesLight Infantry - no specific examples given, except to say that many armies rely on light, skirmishing missile troopsHeavy Cavalry - examples given are Macedonian Companions and Crusader KnightsLight Cavalry - examples include Numidian Cavalry Andrew Mongol horse archersHeavy Chariots - examples here include Assyrian four-horse Chariots, and Hittite two-horse and three-horse ChariotsLight Chariots - examples include Egyptian and British two-horse ChariotsScythed Chariots - the example given is the Persian useElephants - here the examples are the Indian and Carthaginian armiesArtillery - the example given of battlefield (i.e. Not in a siege) use is the RomansEach of these units are portrayed with four stands per unit, except for the last three types. Scythed Chariots, Elephants, and Artillery each have only one stand in a unit.Hannibal crossing the Rhone - Henri Paul MotteSome interesting things are already apparent. Although the first sub period covers warfare in the early part of the fifth century BC (490-480 BC) with the wars between the Greeks and Persians, and moving forward - there are no chariot armies.  This is already beyond the period of Assyria and the Hittites, and even the period of chariot use in Egypt, yet they are mentioned in the textile on unit types. Also, a quick look over the army lists provided shows no army in the book with heavy Chariots. Although not stated, what the author has done here is to present a ruleset with broad applicability beyond the Armies and sub periods he discusses.Another thing of note is that it states in the second chapter, on rules, that units take four hits per stand, regardless of the troop type. With some units having only one stand, that make sure those units are very fragile and vulnerable. Since we are talking about Scythed Chariots, Elephants, and Artillery, this makes sense.One thing mentioned near the end of chapter one, and unfortunately not mentioned again clearly in chapter two (but stated in the introduction to chapter three on army lists for these rules), is that the standard game is played between armies of eight units each.An additional thing mentioned in chapter one, is the concept of armor, which applies to infantry and cavalry. Armor types are Extra Heavy, Heavy, Medium and Light.  These confer saving throws to avoid casualties in both shooting and hand-to-hand combat.  Crossbows reduce the effect of armor, and artillery hits ignore it entirely.  The second chapter contains the rules, in a well organized outline format. Set up rules are not given, but victory conditions are. If an army is reduced to two units (25%) then it has lost.  In addition, if any of your units exits the map/board on the enemy's baseline, other than Light Infantry, the enemy player must remove two of his own units.  Presumably this represents panic due to having the baggage looted, or a withdrawal route cut off.The rules start off with giving the turn sequence.  This is a typical, old school version of I go/You go. The sequence given is:Charge SequenceMovementShootingHand-to-hand combatMorale testsOnce one player completes all five phases, then it is the other player's turn, until the game ends.  Nothing exotic here, and it gives a fairly good flow.Charging is done in three steps.  First, prior to measuring, the player whose turn it is announces charges. Then they are measured. If the enemy is reached, move the unit. If the unit cannot reach it stays put with no other penalty. If the target unit is equipped with javelins, it may then fire at the charging unit, as long as the charging unit moved at least 8cm.  The third step mentions that combat will occur, but not until the hand-to-hand phase.All other (non-charging) movement is next.  Artillery is immobile, all other units have a movement rate from 8cm for heavy infantry, up to 24cm for light cavalry.Wheeling and turning are not defined, but if any unit other than Light Cavalry or Light Infantry wish to move in any direction other than a straight line ahead, they only move at half speed.  Presumably this also includes Light Chariots, as they are not listed with the other group.About movement: when I use the rules to run games on a club night, or at a convention, it is the movement rules that causes the most difficulties for veteran players.  There are no rules for different formations, and no rules for various maneuvers found in many rulesets.  So, if you want to oblique, move at the wheel, turn a unit about, etc. then you are able to, as long as no part of the unit moves more than the allowed amount (full movement value for Light Cavalry or Light Infantry; half movement value for everyone else).  As there are no rules that (for instance) allow a unit to about face in place (rather than wheeling through 180 degrees; or spinning the unit with a forward wheel on one flank, and a rearward wheel on the opposite flank), it presumably cannot be done - except by following the general \"half move for any movement other than straight ahead\".  Note, in the army lists, there are some exceptions, for instance some heavy horse archers are allowed to make free about face maneuvers..  However we have found, as with most things, that reasonable house rules (or referee interpretations) can allow for certain things not expressly forbiddenThe rules give instances for three classes of terrain.  Rivers take a unit a complete turn to cross (they start on one bank, and just move to the other bank is the implication).  Hills block line of sight, but otherwise don't affect movement.  Woods are immobile to some units (Cavalry, Chariots, Elephants), slow down other units to half speed (Heavy Infantry, and Heavy Archers),  but don't slow down light Infantry or Warbands.Rules are given that allow Light troops (Infantry, Cavalry, Chariots) to fire on the move. Other units cannot do so.Shooting rules are next. Weapons are defined by their maximum range, from 8cm for javelins, up to 48cm for artillery.  Rolls to hit are based on rolling one dice per stand in the firing unit, and the target number is based on the weapon.  There are no modifiers to the hit number. Bows and Javelins need 4,5,6.  Crossbows need 5,6.  Units in the woods suffer only half the hits rolled. The rules don't state, but we round this up for the shooter's favor. (House Rule)Next, the target unit gets to make saving rolls for each hit scored.  As mentioned, this chance is reduced versus crossbows.Artillery fire is somewhat different. Rather than rolling one dice to hit for the artillery, the firing player first roll said one dice, to see how many to-hit dice he gets.  Then roll to hit, again halve hits vs targets in the woods.  There are no saving rolls vs artillery, every hit results in a kill.Recall it takes four kills to eliminate a stand from a unit. Kills have to be marked, as they are persistent, until a stand is removed. We use plastic upholstery rings, hung on the miniature that is killed. But any method works.  I have seen online battle reports, where players use a dice behind the unit, indicating how many hits have been scored. When 4 are reached, a stand is removed.When an elephant receives four hits, since its only a one stand unit, it would normally be eliminated. Instead it rolls to go berserk.  It moves a full move in a direction based on a random chart, and if it strikes a unit, it immediately fights a round of combat.  Then the poor beast dies.Next we get to hand to hand combat.  The rules give a set of priority considerations, to determine who strikes first..  Units then roll a number of d6 per stand in the unit, based on an striker/target matrix.  Hits are on a 4,5,6. Saving throws are allowed, and kills marked.  Both sides get to fight, but if a stand is lost to a foe who fights first in priority, it does not get to roll.Saving rolls are not allowed against Elephants or Scythed Chariots.Special striker/target considerations apply to combat in the woods, making Warband twice as effective there.Artillery units contacted for Hand-to-hand combat don't fight, they are immediately destroyed.Finally, the morale phase occurs. If the unit lost any bases in the turn, it makes a d6 test for each lost base. The scores required are based on morale grade of the unit. If a dice test is failed, the unit loses an additional stand for each failure.  Those are the rules as presented. In the next few articles, I will discuss the Armies and sub periods.  Links to the successive article for each period of army lists are below.NT Rules: Ancient Army Lists I - Persian InvasionNT Rules: Ancient Army Lists II - Alexander the Great NT Rules: Ancient Army Lists III - The Punic WarsNT Rules: Ancient Army Lists IV - Imperial RomeNT Rules: Ancient Army Lists V - Crusades"},
{"title": "Examining the rules of Neil Thomas", "date": "Monday, February 24, 2020", "text": "Since the publication of his first wargaming book (Wargaming:an Introduction) the various rule sets of Neil Thomas have provided wargamers with a number of very playable, simple rulesets for a variety of different time periods. I have played many of them, and I find them to be excellent in teaching wargaming to newcomers.  They lack many of the finer details and options found in longer rulesets, but they provide an enjoyable game, with good results, and have provided a great basis for tinkerers to adapt the format to a wide list of variants and options.There are a number of good reviews of the rules, addressing their features and limits, found through the wargaming press (blogs, magazines, etc.). I thought it might be worth while to go through the different rulesets, and point out specific features and mechanics, and discuss what I have found to be useful and enjoyable, and what might be done differently.His first book has no fewer than six different rulesets, all of which have slightly different mechanisms for their appropriate periods. These cover: Ancients (and medieval), Pike and Shot, Napoleonic, American Civil War, Skirmish Wargaming (multi period), and WWII.  Two of these have gotten much greater in depth treatment in later publications (Ancient and Medieval Wargaming, and Napoleonic Wargaming).  The American Civil War rules are very interesting, and might be thought of as a special case in his later book Wargaming Nineteenth Century Europe but remain distinct enough, both in rules and in theater of action, that I consider the later book a stand alone, and not a refinement.I'll follow this post up with a series of articles on each of the six rulesets in his first book, looking at the rules, the army lists, and give my thoughts."},
{"title": "2019 Autumn Miniatures gaming", "date": "Wednesday, November 6, 2019", "text": "Not a lot to report on the miniatures front, although that is about to change.  Over the summer I played a half dozen different SAGA games, and at Call to Arms (the October wargaming convention in Williamsburg) I was able to play a game of SAGA.  That game, I was playing my friend Stephen from the ODMS club, and he was running Pagan Rus.  I was running (for the first time) plain old Vikings.  I managed to eke out a win, and I suspect my reliance on large units (a lesson I learned while running my Anglo-Saxons) helped -I had two 12 man units of Warriors.  Plus a 12 man unit of Levy, and a 4 man unit of Hearth Guard/Berserkers.Saga at Call to Arms - me on the right, with VikingsPreviously I ran a game at Guns of August (at the Virginia War Museum in Newport News).  My game was a 28mm skirmish game of Romans vs. Germans, a follow on small skirmish after the Teutoburger Wald forest battle.  The figures were an assortment of different Foundry barbarian types, and the Romans were a mix of different manufactures.  The rules used were the Song of Blades and Heroes, using just historical troop types.  It wasn't my cup of tea, but I admit I should try the rules again.  I am inclined to think I would much rather play something like an adaptation of Lion Rampant, or even Warhammer historical.Our club, which historically had been a Thursday night club, now has groups that meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The Tuesday cadre has a dedicated group that plays Warrior 15mm ancients every week.  The other part of Tuesday nights are boardgamers - Settlers of Catan, and that sort of thing.American Revolutionary War - Battle of Freeman's FarmNow, coming up I have two miniatures games planned.  The  first will be a 15mm version of Freeman's Farm (part of the Saratoga Campaign, 1777).  I had thought of using Black Powder for this game, which I enjoy, but instead I am going to use the much easier Neil Thomas rules.  There is an excellent fan version of his rules (based on the Napoleonic version, but with more concentration on Linear Tactics), covering 18th century, with some lists of troop types for the American Revolutionary War.  I will use those rules, although there is a peculiar feature of them.  That is, formed infantry cannot charge other formed infantry, unless that target unit is smaller.  This rule exists in several of the horse and musket era Neil Thomas rule sets, in order to push the idea of the musketry firefight.  Two units that approach, have to stop and exchange firepower with each other, before one goes charging in.  Pretty historical, but different from what most wargamers expect.For the scenario, I am consulting a couple of wargaming sources I have - the scenario guide for British Grenadier, and also the battle description in the 1st edition Black Powder rulebook.  For historical sources, I am looking at 'A Guide to the Battles of the American Revolution' and some internet sources such as British Battles.There is a Freeman's Farm scenario for Tricorne (the Commands & Colours variant for AWI), that I might play before I run the game (solo, probably). Just to get some more insights into the battle, but a Tricorne scenario is at a different level of abstraction/scale than a miniatures battle.The portions of the battle I want to focus on are Fraser and Burgoyne on the British side, and Arnold, Morgan's minutemen, and Dearborn's lights on the American side.  I will probably omit Reidesel, although the Hessians would make an interesting part of the scenario, they don't show up until late in the day, and might present a balancing problem for the scenario.Denbigh Fusiliers in the SudanThe other game I have planned, is a game of The Sword and the Flame in 28mm.  This will be held on the Friday of Thanksgiving weekend. The battle is a company of British regulars (the Denbigh Fusiliers) moving through some territory where British and Egyptian friendly villages have raised a small makeshift militia to defend against the Mahdists that are overwhelming the region.  Almost like a \"Magnificent Seven\" or \"Seven Samurai\" type scenario - but instead of 7 heroes helping the villagers to defend themselves, here you have two platoons of Tommy regulars in Khaki helping to fight off the Dervish attack.  The scenario is called \"Friendly Territory\" and is the first battle of the \"Denbigh Fusiliers\" mini campaign.  It should be fun.  More as the game approaches."},
{"title": "Miniatures gaming update", "date": "Tuesday, March 12, 2019", "text": "I recently got to play in a few miniatures games, which I had been absent from for some months with the busy time at the end of fall semester, over the holidays, and heading into spring semester.At the Williamsburg Muster in February, I got to play in a Frostgrave game, very fun.  I forgot my own wizard and his stats at home, so I used a \"loaner\" wizard (actually my friend John D.'s wizard), and I did well enough.  I retrieved a single treasure, but did get to kill (using the spell \"Bone Dart\") my friend Jon K.'s wizard (Jon set up and hosted the game, and I repaid him with Bone Dart).Also I got to try out Impetus again, using Late Romans vs. Sassanid Persians.  Fun game.  I played against Stephen P.  We had a good time, and have enjoyed these rules pretty well.  Looking forward to trying some more armies.  The Romans did well and were performing very nicely in terms of points, at the time the game was called, but the Persians had just broken through with an encircling move on one flank, and it wouldn't be long before Roman Collapse.  Still, a very fun game.Over the holidays, I got to play in a large 1809 game using the Shako II rules (with the D10 modification).  Very fun.I've gotten to play a few Saga battles here and there, very fun.Coming up - projects I am working on, to run soon, are:An 1965 scenario between Pakistan and India, using Cold War commander.  To get ready for this, I am doing some 1:300 scale Asian terrain.  The battle I am doing featured some flooded rice fields, so I am doing rice paddocks (and I am trying to straddle the line for pieces that could be used for 1:300 or 10mm or 15mm).  Also, some villages.Using Piquet: Field of Battle to play a Russo-Japanese scenario.  There are things I like about Basic Piquet, and some things I don't like.  I believe that FoB preserves the good, and patches over the bad, so I want to give it a try.Mexican-American War - looking for a new ruleset.  I may try Field of Battle if the above game goes well.Japanese Medieval - Will be basing my Japanese on 80mm wide bases.  I'm pretty sure I will be doing two Samurai armies.  Will also look into doing the Koreans.  Looking to play \"To the Strongest\" with these armies."},
{"title": "Gaming over the Christmas Holiday 2018", "date": "Monday, January 7, 2019", "text": "One of the things I enjoy most about being employed by a University, is that my work schedule is more or less similar to a student's schedule, which means I get a break over Christmas every year.  This is (as reported on in previous years here at Gaming with Chuck) a time for family, friends, and in our house - gaming is one of the ways we spend time together.  This year was no exception.The gaming we did was of three varieties.  First, there was a lot of board games and card games.   These were done at home, with either the immediate family, the extended family, or with friends so close they are practically family.  More on what we played down below.  Second, there was some miniature wargaming.  With my reduced schedule, I actually got to play some wonderful miniature wargames - I usually try to host one (as the referee) over the holidays, but not this year.  Instead I got to play in a few (again, details below).  Third, there is roleplaying. We did not do a lot of RPG gaming this year over the Christmas break, but did manage to get one day of gaming in, right around New Years, which was a smashing success.So, first, the board gaming.  There are a couple of board gaming activities that take place at our house over Christmas time.  Every year we participate in the Boardgame Geek Christmas Card Exchange.  This year was no different - we were able to send out some great cards to gamers all over the planet (we signed up for 12 gamers to send cards to, and received random names from a list).  I try to read the profile of the person getting the card on BGG before sending the card, and writing a note about their type of gaming, and any ways it intersects with ours.  Also, every year at Christmas time we try to have a few boardgame days at the house, where we host people with lots of Christmas treats, music, drinks, and boardgames.  A great time.  This year was no different.  We had friends over several times.  Finally, every year around Christmas time, we try to get some new boardgames to play as a family, and spend the spare time of the holiday break playing them together.  Some great breakout titles this year have been Sagrada, Queendomino, and Railroad Ink: Blue.As gifts there are some games we got but haven't tried yet.  That includes (finally) the Toscany addition to Viticulture, and Anita received Between Two Castles.For miniatures gaming, chiefly I got to play in three games.  First, I got to play in Saga - the Viking Age skirmish game.  I got to run out my Anglo-Saxons against the feared Jomsvikings.  Great game.  Practically speaking it was a tie, but I hand the victory to the Jomsvikings.  In that game I tried a different commander for my Anglo-Saxon force.  Typically, I use a regular (generic, non-named) Warlord, but this time I used Alfred the Great.  He has some (according to the rulebook) abilities in the game as a playing piece, and I love the history of Alfred, but it just wasn't my playing style.  Second, I got to play in a fantastic game of Shako II - 15mm Napoleonic rules.  The battle was an 1809 battle between the Austrians and French, and I was on the French side.  Loads of fun even though our side lost (as it did in real life).  The third game was a battle of late ancients, with Late Romans fighting Sassanid Persians.  We used the Impetus rules for this one, and it was a lot of fun.  A bit strange with so many new players, but we agreed the rules (now 10 years old) were very good, and deserve a rematch.Finally, we played an RPG session.  Our last RPG series, which was a dungeons and dragons game set in the World of Greyhawk, saw a big break coming up for the players, as they prepared for the next part of their quest.  Taking advantage of that natural pause in the campaign, we this time played with a new set of players, having a city adventure, protecting a shipment of wine, arriving in the city of Niole Dra during the midwinter festival week of Needfest.  Lots of fun, as invisible thieves, evil knights, and goblins tried to spoil the winter festival.  The new adventurers uncovered a much bigger plot than the simple theft of fine wine, and the game will no doubt continue in the future.I will end by saying that one of the highlights of the Holidays was getting together with my Brother's family, which is almost always a chaotic affair, but this year it included some gaming.  We taught them how to play the Christmas card game, 12 days of Christmas (not the one pictured above, but rather the one from Dr. Gordon Hamilton, published by Eagle-Gryphon).  It was a lot of fun, and I think my brother's family are almost recruits into gaming.God bless all who read this, and I hope we all have a great 2019."},
{"title": "28mm Dismounted Boers - a short review", "date": "Tuesday, November 27, 2018", "text": "28mm Boer War Figures - a quick review...Thinking about my Old Glory dismounted Boers got me considering the different Boer War lines I've seen/painted over the years, and I considered writing a really quick review.  Note, this is just the Boers (Transvaal trekkers).Ral Partha - True 25s (so quite small by today's standards), but these were truly fantastic figures.  The only drawback was that at the time, very few different poses were in a single product line.  I still have some, but they don't mix well with my other figures.Foundry - Excellent as always.  Good poses, good choice of equipment, and both mounted and foot. The problem? Only one code for each mounted and foot. So that means six poses of foot, and 3(4) poses for mounted.  They do have an excellent supply wagon that works for the Boers Old Glory - A great range.  They have two packs of (30 figures each) dismounted Boers - firing and skirmishing.  These are a mix of hats/equipment, so would work for the 1880s or 1899.  These paint up really well.They have a pack of mounted (10 figure plus horses) that is also excellent.  They have a pack of Staatsartillerie that include both gun crewmen and uniformed officers (Orange Free Staters?).  The guns are sold separately but they have whatever you might like.  Other than my old Ral Partha holdouts, the vast preponderance of my Boer War collection is Old Glory.Warlord - They have a nice pack of dismounted Boers that includes four body styles, with two heads each.  Very nice, and excellent quality.  But out of production right now. They have a new mounted set of Boers that also look great.Black Tree - Great figures . . . except the Boers all have HUGE hands.  They are Gargantuan.  Not sure who the sculptor is.Age of Glory has, in his Zulu Wars line, a nice selection of really attractive Boers.  Always high quality, but I have not painted these.North Star has a nice line of 28mm Boers.Essex, of course makes a nice range of 15mm Boers (I've painted, and used to own them, before converting to 28mm for TSATF), but I don't think they make a 28mm Boer War line.One last thing - there are some nice guns associated with these ranges.  Old Glory has a nice, affordable selection of the main pieces you could want (Krupp, Pompom, etc).  On Shapeways, there is a really nice 3d printed model of a Long Tom gun.  It is from MojoBob design, under his 1:56 range.This is a continuation of the conversation started in Part I.I would like to talk about the turn sequence for Baroque, which is one of the things that makes the game attractive for me.  I was never much of an Impetus player, (I played the free Starter version a few times, using typical Roman/Barbarian army pairs, but not too much).  So, the Baroque structure is one that I am exploring with a fresh perspective.A few things have to be defined before getting into the turn structure.First, the army will have a Command Structure.  This is defined by the army list, or a series of options are given.  An army can have Good, Average or Poor.  These cost an increasing number of points, and there is a range given for Leader figures, where they can use their leadership bonus to keep troops under control.  For instance, an Average Command Structure costs the army a total of 12 points, and it means that leaders in that army have a leadership range of 6BU (Baroque Units, or in the case of 15mm armies, 6x 60mm baroque units).  Other Command Structure levels, with cost and range, is found in the rulebook.The turn sequence works like thisDecide the InitiativeThe active player (one by one) activates all the units in the Command he has activated.  The inactive player responds with reactions and/or evasions.Initiative is re-decided, and repeat until all of the Commands on the table have been activated.Deciding the initiative works like this - Each player selects one of their commands (each army is divided up into a number of 'commands' that each contain several units).  Both players roll 2d6 for their selected command, and apply dice modifiers based on the leadership bonus of the Leader of their command.  High roller wins the initiative.  If there is a tie, then the highest rated Command Structure will break the time.  Otherwise, re-roll to see who has initiative. Once a command has been identified as having initiative. the player controlling that command now activates each of his units, one at a time, and then plays out all that the unit is doing that turn.The actions that a unit can do include these:RallyWithdraw (from the battlefield)MoveDisengage (from a melee)ShootCharge Fight a MeleeA move action can be repeated multiple times, but each time after the first, once the move is completed, the unit must pass a discipline test, or the unit is Disordered.  If the unit is trying to contact the enemy, the last move action is considered a Charge, and certain rules affect it (the rolling of an additional charge bonus distance; the possible reactions of the target of the charge).The rulebook describes how to handle these actions, but many of them will allow for the opposing player to engage in a Reaction.  In this way, the turn is integrated, and both players are involved throughout.The reactions allowed are these:  ActionReactionWithdrawOpp Fire or Opp ChargeMoveOpp Fire or Opp ChargeChargeOpp Fire, Def Fire, or CounterchargeShootOpp Fire or Opp ChargeThe reaction can only be against the unit that enabled the reaction.  So that if I move my Pike & Musket unit, and it comes close enough to an enemy unit that it can Opportunity Fire, it can only do so vs. the unit (my Pike & Musket unit) that triggered it.In addition to the Reactions listed, many units may also Evade.If more than one unit can React to an acting unit, only one may be selected to React.If a reacting unit decides to Opportunity Charge, it may hit a different target unit, if such is in the way of the movement of the Opportunity Charging unit.So, the turn is quite interesting, as the player who has initiative has to decide if his actions are worth doing, if they may trigger some reaction by the enemy. Movement All movement and movement bonus amounts are given in multiples of the BU (Baroque Unit).  USUALLY but not always, foot are 1BU and mounted are 2BU, but there are exceptions.  For instance, on the 30YW German Catholic army included in the rulebook, there are infantry musket units called Schutzen.  They have a move of 2BU.Units may be classed as either Fast or Slow (but not all units are - most are average).  A Fast Unit has a benefit to the discipline test after second or subsequent movement orders (meaning it is easier for Fast units to do more than one move order).  A Slow Unit is the opposite - there is a penalty to the discipline test after performing additional move orders.The movement rules cover interpenetration, maneuver and wheeling, obstacles and terrain, and how to handle the charge bonus (which is given in BUs of course).ShootingShooting is handled by rolling a number of dice equal to the shooting unit's VBU (Basic Unit Value, recall that the acronym VBU is from the Italian, not English version of the rules).  That number gives a basic number of dice for shooting, which is modified by a Range chart.  The range bands are Point Blank (1BU), Short (2BU), Long (4BU), and Extreme (8BU).  Most hand weapons (bow, musket, pistol, etc) have a maximum range of either short or long.  The firing table in the book gives you a number of extra dice that you gain, or lose, at different range bands, based on your weapon type.The dice are rolled, and modified by situations (first volley, shooting while moving, shot modifier for mixed infantry units, etc).  Each 6 causes a DAMAGE (a hit), and every pair of 5s causes a hit.  Count up all the hits (total Damage), and then the target unit makes a Cohesion test, to see if the Damage tranlates into Losses.Damage is not permanent, but is only a modifier to the Cohesion Test.  For every point that a unit misses it's Critical Number (which is the VBU of the unit, minus the Damage it took), it takes a reduction to it's VBU.  So if the Critical Number is (as an example) 2, and the Cohesion Dice Test comes up a 4, the unit would take a permanent Loss of -2 to it's VBU. If a unit has it's VBU reduced to 0, it routs immediately and is removed from the table.If a unit passes the Cohesion test, it takes no Losses, but does suffer Disorder.  A disordered unit that AGAIN is disordered, will instead take a VBU loss.The book gives rules for commanders being hit, arc of fire, reduced effect firing (like into terrain, or blocked) and discusses particulars for artillery, pistols, and defensive & opportunity fire.MeleeFighting the melee is similar to shooting.  Once two units are engaged and fighting (there are rules determining charge effects, flank charges, melee modifiers for certain unit types and situations, etc.), each will roll it's allowed number of dice (VBU plus or minus modifiers). A gain, 6s and 5s are the dice that cause damage.Once again, there is a roll to see if the damage translates into permanent Losses (i.e. a Cohesion test).Following the melee, and determining results, there are rules determining retreats and pursuits, and how they are evaluated.Rules are given for commander casualties, and also for mixed (i.e. multi unit) melees.Skirmishers that are hit in the open by formed units do not fight, but are immediately dispersed (remove from the table).  Again, there are rules covering melee and Artillery, and Baggage trains.The rest of the rulebook covers special rules, setting up battles, and a number of army lists.  These will be covered in Part III."},
{"title": "Getting familiar with Baroque (part I)", "date": "Saturday, November 10, 2018", "text": "The term Renaissance as a period is one which has been responsible for a lot of ink - in both history circles, as well as by wargamers.  Going with the various articles published here at Gaming with Chuck over the years, I am going to (vaguely) take it to represent warfare (typically, but not exclusively) dealing with Western Europe (and the border regions of Western Europe - say with the growing powers in the south and the east).  As far as time periods go, I am going to limit myself with the 16th and 17th centuries (so, roughly, from 1500-1700AD).There is a lot going on in other parts of the world, and the study of conflicts there is equally worthy of wargaming (in fact, I have even published a set of rules for the Samurai battles in Japan (From the Sky we Came) which covered the Sengoku period, up until the battle of Sekigahara in 1600 AD.  But, that is a different sort of warfare from what I am discussing here.Here, I am focusing on warfare in Western Europe.  These are the conflicts of the Italian Wars, the wars of religion that grew out of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation.  The possible conflict between England and Spain.  The battles of the Spanish Netherlands.  The many conflicts making up both the Thirty Years War and the English Civil Wars (both in the 17th century), and so on.  These battles and wars are marked by several broad features - the presence of gunpowder, the reliance of infantry (in many cases) on pike, the presence of armor (especially, but not only, for mounted units) and the existence of interesting mixed-arms formations (starting with the tercio formations coming out of the Italian Wars, and then moving to the more streamlined pike and musket formations of the 17th century, which eventually gave way to pure musket formations by the end of this period).I've reviewed, and reported various battles, using several sets of rules for this period.  I have read many, many more.  Lately I have looked into Baroque, from the Italian wargaming company of Dadi & Piombo.These are an evolution of the Impetus rules for ancient and medieval warfare, published earlier by Dadi & Piombo.  As the cover states, these cover 1550 to 1700.  The earlier Impetus rules overlapped with this period, and the very nice wargame lists they produce on the website have armies up to and including 16th century (including some of the Central American armies - another focus of warfare in this period, but not what I am discussing here).My recent (the past 2-3 years) renaissance wargaming was with a modified version of the Neil Thomas Renaissance rules, from his \"Wargaming: An Introduction\" (several convention games, and an Italian Wars scenario).  While they produce a small, and satisfying game, they are a bit limited in troop types, and also in allowable player actions.  While they are excellent for introductory games, and for small convention games (to introduce a period), they don't have the complexity or depth to keep more experienced wargames engaged for long.  On the other hand, these days, I am not a big fan of very complex rules.  While I admire the Field of Glory rules, and their Renaissance version, they are not the rules for me.  Also, while I am a huge fan of the George Gush rules (mentioned here on Gaming with Chuck with some of my other Renaissance rules reviews), they don't play well with a modern audience.  However, I think that Baroque might fill the sweet spot (at least until we try By Fire and Sword).Unit TypesAs mentioned, Baroque covers 1550-1700.  The unit types it features are perfect for representing battlefields in that period.  There are, roughly, two different types of units, plus artillery.The first type are Mounted Troops, and include several classes of unit -Gallopers - Shock cavalry trained to charge at a gallop, may use a pistol, but more likely to rely on the sword or lance.  Trotters - Cavalry that charge at a trot.  These almost always will be pistol armed, and will discharge those during the slower charge, to follow up with contact by sword.Reiters - These are pistol armed (and perhaps heavily armored) cavalry, the prefer to not close to contact - but instead will keep their distance, and employ pistol tactics, like the Caracole maneuver.Sipahis - Eastern cavalry, usually armed with missile weapons.  Sometimes present in large units (treated as a 'Massed Unit').Light Cavalry - These are fast, skirmish cavalry, often armed with missile weapons.  Horse & Musket - In the later part of this period, some trotter units will have integrated foot musketeers, for greater strength on engaging the enemy in fire combat.  This is a mixed unit with mounted and foot soldiers in the same unit.The second type are Foot Troops, which also include several classes of unit -Pike & Musket - This is the mixed unit of pikemen and musketeers made popular with the advent of more, and more reliable, hand weapons that use gunpowder.  Because a portion of the unit is armed with pikes, this reduces firepower, but also provides a strong deterrent to cavalry, and the ability to hit other infantry in contact. Early Tercio - This is very, very deep unit, coming out of the 16th century, with some integrated shot troops.  Because of its extreme depth, and training in deployment, it is almost impossible to gain a flank advantage against this unit, but it is extremely vulnerable to artillery.Later Tercio - Not as deep as the earlier tercio, and sometimes employing a higher ratio of shot troops, the Later Tercio is almost as flexible as the Pike & Musket unit, but still a bit more unwieldy.  It is not as well protected on the flanks and rear as the Early Tercio, but it has enough shot troops posted there that it can give fire out of those aspects of the formation.Pikemen - Deep formations of only pikemen, without integrated shot troops.  These are popular in the earlier part of the period by those nations fielding pikemen, but not employing the Tercio.Irregular Infantry - These are (sometimes) fierce hand to hand fighters.  Sometimes they are equipped with missile weapons.  Sometimes they appear in large units (treated as a 'Massed Unit').  But they are not the disciplined mixed units listed above.Shooters - As with Pikemen units, these are from the earlier part of the period before the mixed units took over - these are units of purely missile armed soldiers.Skirmishers - Light troops, sometimes armed with good quality firearms, designed to skirmish with the enemy.Dragoons - These are mounted infantry, armed with missile weapons.  They combine the faster maneuverability of mounted troops, with the ability of infantry to provide good missile fire.Other classes of tabletop units -Artillery is available.  In this  period, as the science of artillery is being developed, there is a bewildering constellation of different types of guns, calibers, firing mechanisms, etc.  These are all simplified in the rules to light, medium or heavy batteries.  And further, they are classed as either Cannons (firing a relative flat trajectory), and Howitzers (firing a high arcing shot).Commanders - The army will be divided up into a handful (usually 3 or 4) of commands (or brigades).  Each of these has a commander.  One of these commanders will be the General (or commander in chief).  A commander can be attached (if he wishes) to any non-artillery unit in his command.  the commander-in-chief can be attached (if he wishes) to any non-artillery unit in the entire army.Baggage - All armies have immobile baggage.  The baggage may be Fortified or Not.Measurements in the GameBattlefield measurements in the game are measured (and listed on the charts) in terms of BU, or  'Baroque Units' - so named to distinguish them from the basic unit of measure from Impetus, which was the Unit, or U.  In Baroque, the BU is equal to half the frontage of a standard unit (which is always 12cm).  So, a BU is 6cm.  Speaking of unit frontage...Unit basingFor 15mm, the standard unit frontage is 12cm.  Which is perfect for me, as my units are based on standard 4cm wide bases.  So three bases wide, makes a unit.  For Pike & Musket units that is perfect - a stand of pikes in the middle, flanked by two stands of muskets - looks great.Using larger one piece bases would be nice, but I don't want to rebase my renaissance wargaming armies.The depth of the units varies, with the deepest being the Early Tercio - it is 12cm deep.  Since I mount my pikes in two ranks on a 3cm deep (or sometimes 4cm deep) stand, it is easy for me to model an Early Tercio - 3 stands wide, and 3 or 4 stands deep(!) - but it is the biggest unit in the game (and was quite large in history too).  A more standard Pike and Musket unit is listed as 4-6cm deep - which means, for me, one or two stands deep for Pikemen in the middle, and two stands deep of Musketeers on the flanks.  Easy, and it looks good.  Cavalry is easier - one rank deep.  Massed Mounted units are two ranks deep.I'll follow this article up in Part II with a discussion of the turn sequence, and basic game structure."},

{"title": "General d'Armee - first thoughts", "date": "Friday, August 3, 2018", "text": "Recently, we played a couple of games of General d'Armee at our regular ODMS game meetings.  These have been run by Sean (read about his gaming stuff over at Mad Mac's Attic), although I suspect that they have struck a chord with the group, and that we'll be playing more.The rules are available from Too Fat Lardies, who sell the Reisswitz Press rules (that is the imprint of David Brown's current batch of rules).  These (GdA) are on a step up from General d'Brigade (GdB), and one of the chief differences is that now battalions and regiments are treated as somewhat generic in size, only differentiating by gross categories (large, regular, small, etc).  This is very similar to Black Powder, etc. and different from the earlier rules (GdB) - which had you using specific numbers of miniatures for different units, based on historical OB.  There are a ton of useful resources at David Brown's blog.The turn sequence runs (roughly) like this -Both sides dice for the number of Aides de Camp (ADC) available.The ADCs are applied to units.Each brigade is rolled for to see if it is Hesitant or not during that turn.Both sides then roll 2d6 for initiative, subtracting 1 for each Hesitant brigade.Winner chooses to go first or second.First player orders and resolves Charges.Second player orders and resolves Charges.First player resolves moves.Second player resolves moves.First player resolves firing.Second player resolves firing.Melees (resulting from charges, or carried over) are resolved. In all this is a pretty good sequence.Firing is done (by regular formations and artillery) by the toss of two dice, and then modifiers are introduced.  The final result is consulted on a chart to see what the impact is (casualties, discipline test, etc).Firing by skirmishers is done by granting the skirming formation a number of Casualty dice - roll them, and they cause a hit on 4,5,6.Charges are handled first as a test, to see what the charge results are.  This may, or may not result in a melee or a volley being fired, as well as charging home, retiring, etc.Melee's are resolved by each side having a number of casualty dice (as with skirmish fire), these are rolled and hits counted.  Then the winner of the melee is determined by  comparing these scored hits.In all this is a good set of rules, with a lot of thought going into how the different formations, etc interact with each other.  Looking forward to playing some more of these, I may run a game or two myself in the near future.  Sean has published a Player's Guide over at his blog.Here are some pictures from our most recent game, which was the battle of Maida 1806."},
{"title": "Cold War Commander - How To", "date": "Tuesday, July 24, 2018", "text": "This is a \"how to\" article I wrote for ODMS, giving the basics on how to play Cold War Commander.Cold War Commander – How is it played?1. IntroductionCold War Commander, by Peter Andrew Jones, is a set of rules for modern conflict (1946 until today). It follows (and is very much similar to) Blitzkrieg Commander, which covers WW2. Both rulesets have a lot in common with Warmaster (by Rick Priestley), and Mr. Jones had Mr. Priestley’s blessing to write a set of tank and infantry rules. Other rules that are very similar, are the Warlord rules (Hail Caesar, Pike & Shotte, and Black Powder). All of these rules are currently very popular, in general, and here in ODMS.For those not familiar with Warmaster, what that means is that the basic tempo of the game is this: players will take turns, and on their turn they will try to activate units.  Different command elements (HQ and CO) can make a dice roll vs. a target number (their command value) - if you pass the dice roll, you get to issue an order to some of your units (move, shoot, etc).  The strength of the system is that command structure and command level is a key part of the game, and you are never 100% sure of a plan (as in real life, friction and fog limit military operations).  The weakness of the system is that there are times when a player, or a side, will miss most or all of their command rolls - getting to do very little on their turn.  Very Frustrating!  Details are described below.2. Types of UnitsCold War Commander (CWC) has several types of units. The biggest distinction is between combat units (infantry, vehicles, support weapons), artillery (which may be on or off board), aircraft, and command units. Let’s look at these in reverse order:Command units consist of four types –CO (Commanding Officer) - overall commander of a side in a game – 1 per sideHQ (Headquarters) - in charge of some part of a unit’s combat units – multiple per sideFAO (Forward Artillery Observer) – sights targets and requests unplanned artillery missions – 0 or more per sideFAC (Forward Aircraft Controller) – sights targets and requests close air support missions – 0 or more per sideAircraft units are of two types –Ground attack aircraft, which are requested by an FAC (or used in planned aircraft strike missions)Transport helicopters, which are treated as regular units, to carry infantry and support weaponsArtillery units can be off board (in which case it can be used for planned missions, or in response to the FAO), or can be on board. In either case, they are used for indirect fire, and can fire Barrage missions, or Concentrated missions (see artillery rules in the rulebook).Combat units are everything else (infantry, support weapons, transport vehicles, tanks, etc). All are rated with several pieces of information. These include:MoveAttack (or number of dice to attack with)Hits (to be killed)Armor save (in some cases - usually armored vehicles)  3. Turn SequenceCWC is played in alternate turns. On a turn, you have four phases:Scheduled Phase – Scheduled artillery and aircraft missions for this turn take placeInitiative Phase – Recon units attempt to communicate with a command unit; then any units within the Initiative Distance of the enemy get a free action.Command Phase – Now, command units may, one at a time, attempt to issue orders. Pick a command unit, and then pick a unit to receive an order (or group of units), and declare what the order is (“That unit of tanks will move to the ridgeline.”). Then roll the dice (2d6) vs. the command unit’s command rating. If less than the target number, the unit performs the commanded action, and that command unit may roll again. Note that the subsequent order can be to the same unit. Subsequent rolls are/may be reduced depending on who is being ordered again.If the roll is a failure, that command unit may issue no more orders this turn. Once the CO fails his roll, the side is finished with Command Phase for the turn (hint: use your CO last).End Turn Phase – Check for victory conditions, and then remove all hits from any units on the table that were not destroyed. Additionally, remove suppression markers from the active player (only). 4. Recon UnitsDuring the initiative phase, a Recon unit tries to communicate with the nearest command unit on that side. This is based on a dice roll (based on how close the nearest enemy unit is), and if successful, then the Recon unit can choose an action. Depending on what that command unit is (CO, HQ, FAO, FAC) then the Recon Unit can choose from the following:Add 1 to the command value of the command unit (CO, HQ, FAO, FAC)Issue orders to on-table mortars to fire at that closest enemy unit to the Recce unit (CO or HQ)Request artillery support against the closest enemy unit to the Recce unit (FAO)Request an air strike against the closest enemy unit to the Recce unit (FAC)Note, that the second, third, and fourth item take place during the Command Phase, by the command unit the Recce unit communicated with – this just lets that command unit target the enemy unit that the Recce unit can see. (remember, that the Recce unit doesn’t have to be in line of sight to the command unit it communicates with, so this is a way of “extending the eyeballs” of that command unit). 5. Assets (planned Artillery and Aircraft strikes)Not every side, or every scenario will have Assets available. These are the pre-planned aircraft and artillery missions. The player who has them available must write down where the target of the strike is (based on the map of the game), and on what turn they strike. Different armies have different types of missions available (HE, Smoke, etc).  6. Orders to Combat UnitsThe orders that a command unit may issue to a combat unit are pretty simple. They are: move, deploy and fire. Note, these are the same orders (or actions) that a unit may do during the initiative phase.Move is just that – a unit may move up to its movement value. See the rules about limits from terrain. If a tank unit has a Stabilized weapon, it may also fire, if it only moves half.Deploy is used to set up certain support weapons (such as Mortars or towed guns), also it is the order used to load infantry onto transport units (they must be in contact). Deploy is also used to dismount from transport units. The infantry units (and/or support units) are placed in contact with the transport asset they just dismounted from. Finally, Deploy is used to pivot a set up towed weapon.Fire is used so that the unit (or units) may shoot against an enemy within range, line of sight, and line of fire (all defined in the book).When a unit moves in contact with the enemy, then that is a Close Assault. 7. Command BlundersWhen a command unit is issuing a command and rolls double 6’s – then a blunder has occurred. Not only does the order not succeed but based on what type of order it is (Artillery strike, Aircraft strike, or Command order) there is a roll to see what the blunder causes. Usually bad (like friendly fire). 8. AttacksWhen a unit executes a Fire order – and attacks another unit – that unit rolls the number of attack dice that they have available. The to-hit number is 4+ if the target is in the open; it is 5+ if the target is in soft cover; it is 6 if the target is in hard cover.There are several types of weapons, based on the army listing – those followed by an asterisk * do not cause hits vs. any units with an armor save (i.e. tanks, APCs, IFVs, etc). Those followed by a hash mark # do not cause any hits vs. unit that do not have an armor save (i.e. soft transport, infantry, support weapons).Line of sight is 180 degrees, forward of the unit. Line of fire, in a restricted visibility unit (marked in the army lists) is only 90 degrees, forward of the unit. Armored units can fire at other vehicles, over infantry and guns. Line of sight can pass over infantry and guns, but not over vehicles (friendly or enemy).Command units do not block line of sight. 9. HitsAny unit that takes hits, must make armor saves (if it can). If there are enough un-saved hits to exceed the HITS rating of the unit, it is destroyed. Keep track of the number of hits a unit has taken, even if they aren’t enough to kill it. Other units may attack the same target this turn (although all hits are removed from all targets at the end of each player’s turn).  10. SuppressionFor each hit that was not saved, the attacker rolls the dice again, with the same “to hit” number. If any of the dice score, then the target is suppressed (mark it with a suppression marker).NOTE: You can purposefully try to suppress a unit that you cannot cause hits against (like using a weapon marked * against a tank) – in that case the to-hit number is automatically a 6+. Saves are allowed. Unsaved hits are then rolled for suppression (again, 6+).Suppression markers are removed from a player’s units only at the end of his turn. 11. Fall Back A unit that is ALREADY suppressed (because it was attacked by another unit, which resulted in suppression), and which receives more hits, may fall back. Instead of rolling for suppression by additional unsaved hits (assuming that the additional hits are not enough to kill the target), the target unit rolls 1d6 for each extra unsaved hit, and falls back that many cm. If the unit has to fall back more than 10cm in a turn, it is destroyed (the crew/infantry abandon the field, hide, run away, etc).  12. Close AssaultThe rulebook has a series of restrictions on close assault, but in general when a unit contacts an enemy, there is a close assault. AFVs can only close assault in the open, unless they are carrying infantry or support riders. Transports that close assault automatically dismount their infantry, in contact with the enemy, when the assault starts (except IFVs which may keep them on board) Friendly units within 10cm can support the close assault, if they can draw a line of sight to one of the assaulting units in contact with the enemy.Responding units can also have 10cm of supporters to fire back.Once hits are rolled for (all close assaults hit on 4+, to determine the number of dice rolled, consult the chart on p. 35), determine which unit (on each side) takes the hits. Roll for saves if possible. Then compare outcomes and follow the results (also on page 35).Close assaults are deadly. And can be unpredictable.  13. Infantry Support WeaponsMachine Guns and Infantry Anti-tank Weapons (RPG-7, Bazooka, etc) do not need a deploy order before they can be fired.Mortars and Recoilless Rifles must have a Deploy between moving and firing (to set up), and also between firing and moving (to break down).Infantry units that have Anti-tank Weapons added on to them, may use their regular attack values, and their IATW attack values. IATW can only be used once per turn by a unit. Armored units do not get a saving throw vs. IATW (unless noted in the army list). 14. Anti-Tank Guided WeaponsATGW (i.e. Anti-Tank Missiles, such as Sagger, MAPATS, TOW) are extremely deadly, and long ranged.There are firing restrictions (see the rulebook, p. 24), and they can only be fired once per turn. If a unit is targeted by an ATGW, there is a dice roll to see if it can evade. This is one dice, vs. the same to hit number required for the ATGW to hit the target. If this evade dice hits, then the target may not evade.Roll the attack as normal. However, if the evade dice misses, then the target saw the missile coming in, and may evade. It can move up to 10cm in any direction, and the to hit number against it gets worse by one category (i.e. – if in the open, it is treated as in soft cover, etc). If the unit was already in full cover, or if the 10cm move can get it out of LOS, then it cannot be struck.  15. Artillery, Aircraft, Engineering, Tactical Doctrine, Opportunity Fire, etcThere is a lot more to this ruleset, but the above presents the basic ideas required to play. Some things are often forgotten (like Initiative Moves, Recon communication, and how to do Close Assaults).These are a reminder for those items. In all cases, consult the rules. These aren’t hard rules, and players will get the hang of things in a turn or two."},
{"title": "Jagdpanzer - a rules review", "date": "Sunday, July 22, 2018", "text": "This is another review in the Once and Future Rules series, of wargame rules that are out of print, but that got a lot of play at one time (at least, in the clubs and groups I played in since the early 1980s).Once upon a time, in Campaign Headquarters (in Newport News), there were some gamers called Alfred, Jason and Gary.  They played Jagdpanzer.Once upon a time, in Campaign Headquarters, there were some gamers called Wayne and Oscar.  They played Jagdpanzer.Once up on a time, in Campaign Headquarters, there was a gamer named Danny.  He played Jagdpanzer.Most of the folks I played with in those years (mid to late 80s) were playing Overwatch.  Some were playing Angriff!  But not a small sampling were playing a set of rules called Jagdpanzer, published by Greenfield Hobbies, and authored by Kevin Cabai (a former armor Captain in the US Army).  This was when I tried the rules, and I liked them.One of the strengths that I will applaud, right away, about Jagdpanzer, is that it is very inclusive.  It covers many different weapon systems (armor, infantry, artillery, airpower), all in rule subsystems that are very clean and workable.  The overall effect is a game that gives depth to all sorts of scenarios, but is not difficult to play.  Also, it avoids (by using a dice mechanism for penetration and kill, although informed by real life vehicle and weapon characteristics) the old problem that some rulesets have (I'm looking at you, Overwatch) of comparing mm of penetration, vs mm of armor, to determine a kill.  As an engineering professor, I realize it is not that simple, and that the number of variables present in any single shot to target situation are far to numerous (and perhaps unknowable) in order to present a way of modeling them all.  So why not use a dice mechanism to add in the fuzziness?  Mr. Cabai does just that in Jagdpanzer, and it works very well.Another think I like very much about the game is that while it lists a ground scale (1 inch equals 25m), it gives all movement and weapon ranges in inches.  Nice.Here is an overview of the rules, so you can see what I'm talking about, and I'll return with an assessment at the end.Turn SequenceBasic concept - On each turn, for each of your units (the basic unit is the platoon, which is usually 3-5 individual vehicle models), you decide if that unit is going to do one of the following three options:1. Move and Fire2. Move double (no fire)3. Stationary (double fire)A full turn consists of two movement and direct fire phases (see below).  For each of them, a vehicle decides if it is going to do one of the above options.  So in the first move phase of a turn, a unit could Double Move, and then couldn't fire during the first fire phase.  But then in the second move phase it could Normal Move (and fire in the second fire phase).If a unit Moves and Fires, it is assuming that the unit is moving tactically, taking advantage of available cover, and is loaded and ready to engage if a target is found.A unit that double Moves, is assumed to be moving at top available speed (cross country or road), and doesn't conform necessarily to available cover (so may be easier to hit).A unit that double Fires is assumed to be stationary, and focused merely on firing and reloading as quickly as possible.Based on that - here is the turn sequence, with some notes:A. Determine Initiative - Roll 1d6 to determine who gets the choice of being Side A or Side B.B. Command & Control (optional rules - a dice roll based on nationality to see if a unit activates or not).C. Movement Phase   1. Side A   2. Side BD. Direct Fire Phase   1. Stationary Shooters fire Simultaneously   2. Moving Shooters fire Simultaneously   3. Stationary Shooters fire Simultaneously (a second time)   4. Close Assaults   5. Overrun Attacks   6. Remove/Emplace Vehicle SmokeE. Aircraft (optional)   1. Movement   2. CombatF. MoraleG. Movement Phase   1. Side B   2. Side AH. Direct Fire Combat (same as D.1 through D.6 from above)I. Artillery   1. Fire missions striking this turn will Impact   2. Plot new fire missions   3. Remove/Emplace Artillery SmokeJ. MoraleMovement - In phases C and G, movement takes place.  The two sides alternate who is the first mover, based on the Initiative dice at the beginning of the turn.  The first mover has 2 minutes (only) to move his Command Vehicles (the command vehicle for each unit).  Then his other vehicles in those units move to follow the command vehicle route.  Once the first player is done, then the second player only has 30 Seconds (!) to move his command vehicles.  Any command vehicles that do not move, mean that the other vehicles in their units will also not move that phase.Movement rates are given for Road, Cross Country, and Rough Ground (wood, hills, mud, deep snow).  Recall that a Double Mover getst double the listed rate.  Rates are listed in inches on the vehicle detail sheets.Armored VehiclesDirect Fire (Tank and Anti-Tank) - Roll 1d20 per shooter, and see if they roll below the \"To Hit\" number.  The basic number to hit is an 11 (or less).  Modifiers to that basic number are here:Situation . . .+3 Consecutive Fire (same target)+3 Automatic Weapons (small AA weapons, autocannons)+2 Targetting a Building+1 Range Finder (PzV-f, Nashorn, PaK36, PaK43, FlaK 18)Target Is . . .-6 Hull Down-6 Entrenched-5 In Dense Woods-3 In Light Woods-4 In Town-4 Infantry-1 Towed Gun-3 MovingShooter Is . . .+2 Short Range+0 Medium Range-4 Long Range-2 Moving (without gun stabilizer)-1 Moving (with gun stabilizer)-2 2nd Shot, Same fire Phase, at a new targetPenetrationTake the Penetration Value of the weapon firing, based on range (short, medium, long), and subtract the armor value of the facing of the vehicle hit (Front, Side, Rear, or Top).  This gives you a number, which can be indexed on a Penetration Chart, to give the Number to roll, or less, on 1d20 to score a kill.  Otherwise the shot has no effect.  Rather than using the chart, you can calculate it easy enough - just add 5 to the penetration value, before subtracting the armor value.  The resulting number is your target to roll, or less, to score a kill.Example: A T34, at Medium Range, is firing it's 76L41 gun at the front armor of a PzIVH.  Looking at the weapon chart for the Soviet Gun, we see that at Medium Range, it penetrates 11.  Looking at the PzIVH, we see that the front armor is rated a 7.  So, adding 5 to the gun's penetration value (11+5=16), and then subtracting the armor of the target vehicle (16-7=9) means that we have a chance of a 9 or less on 1d20 to score a kill, if a hit is registered.  In practice, very simple - lookup the range and penetration, and the armor value of the target.Machine Guns - Vehicle machine guns do not affect armored vehicles in the game.  Larger calibre automatic weapons are listed on the regular vehicle charts.  Normal MGs however, do affect soft targets.  They roll with a strength of '5' on the soft target (i.e. Infantry) table - see below.Catastrophic KillIf the number to score a penetration is half or less than the number needed, then it is a catastrophic kill (for instance, in the example above the number needed was a 9 or less, so rolling a 4 or less would be a catastrophic kill).  This means that all crew, passengers, and equipment are also destroyed with the vehicle.  Also, place a burning marker on the vehicle, it now blocks line of sight.Crew/Passenger BailoutIf a vehicle is killed, but not a catastrophic kill, then there is a chance for bailout by crew and passengers.  Roll 1d6, on a 1 or 2 all personnel are killed, otherwise they bail out.Vehicle SmokeVehicles can (very limited basis) fire smoke rounds.  Pick a target and roll 1d6 for scatter based on range - Short (1,2), Medium (1,2,3), Long (1,2,3,4,5).  If it scatters, the smoke round hits 1 inch away in a randon direction.  It produces a line of sight blocking puffball.Some vehicles have smoke dischargers - these produce a puffball 1 inch from the model of the vehicle, in the direction the tank is facing.Spotting (optional)Spotting rules give a ditance away that a target can be spotted.  It is based on whether the unit being spotted is stationary, in a prepared position (trench or pit), or moving - and also what type of target it is (vehicle, gun, infantry).  This ranges from unlimited range in the open to see a moving vehicle, to only 3 inches to see infantry in the woods or hills in a prepared position.  This is an optional rule, but tends to encourage more play with the terrain and maneuver.  Under these rules, you can spot through smoke, but only up to 4 inches on the other side of the smoke.InfantryInfantry vs. Soft Targets (that is, other infantry units, and vehicles with a side armor of 2 or less) is handled by looking up the basic strength of the infantry unit firing.  This is for a single counter (the game recommends counters for infantry), representing a single infantry squad (usually 3 squads per platoon).  These squads are rated for the following types:InfantryArmored InfantryAirborne InfantryArmored Cav/ReconCavalryHeavy WeaponsHQ SectionCrewEach type has a strength value for the year and nationalities that employ those types (for instance, in 1941 a Soviet infantry squad has a strength of 4, but in 1943, a Soviet infantry squad has a strength of 6, representing better weapons/training/leadership).Each basic type has an associated range, within which it can engage other Infantry.  For instance, basic Infantry has a range of 12 inches, but Cavalry only has a range of 8 inches.Infantry vs. Infantry fighting - when an Infantry squad attacks another, there is a target number based on the terrain the target is in (the only modifier to this number, is if the target is moving, this number is increased by 1):Open - 10 or lessSoft Cover - 8 or lessHard Cover - 7 or lessSupressed - 6 or lessEntrenched - 5 or lessThere is an infantry chart, so your actual number you roll is cross indexed with your squad's strength, to see if you either Supress or Kill the enemy.  In practice, it works very simple.Melee Combat - Infantry ending in contact with enemy counters will fight melee.  Fights are determined by finding all the attacking (moving) counters that are touching a single defender counter.  Roll 1d6 per counter involved.  Any attacker that is less than a defender's number is destroyed.  Any defender that is less than an attacker is destroyed.  Ties are resolved as both destroyed.  So if multiple attackers go against one defender, the defender can beat all of them by rolling the highest number, otherwise as above.Melee modifiers (to the d6 rolled) are these:+1 Charging +1 Cavalry+1 Airborne+1 SS+1 Marines-1 Crew-1 HQ Section-1 Entrenched-1 RoutingInfantry Anti-Tank Weapons - A variety of anti-tank weapons can be employed by Infantry squads.  These include Recoil-less Rifles, Handheld Anti-Tank Rockets (Bazooka, PIAT, etc), Anti-Tank Rifles, and the experimental German X-7 Wire-guided Missile (was it ever really used?).  Each of these weapons has range (short/medium/long) and vehicle penetration rules.Infantry Close Assault - Infantry attacking vehicles use the Close Assault rules.  An infantry squad that closes to contact with an enemy vehicle must pass a Morale test.  If it passes, it rolls 2d6 on the close assault table.  The variables on the table are whether or not the vehicle is closed top, and the terrain (open, wooded, urban).  A range on the 2d6 roll determines if the vehicle is killed.  That is the only result.Other Rules ArtilleryRules are given for artillery pieces on the table to engage in Direct Fire against armor units (ranges and penetration are given for different size guns).  Indirect fire rules are given - how long it takes for an artillery mission to arrive, what types of missions you can call (Point, Rolling Barrage, Creeping Barrage, Final Protective Fire), and what type of pattern it falls in (point/tight, or area/loose).  Rules for scatter of shot from the aiming point are given.    Finally, rules for HE rounds vs. infantry and soft targets (those with a side armor of 2 or less) are given.  Infantry are subjected to a chart much like small arms fire.  Vehicles are two, but hard vehicle targets (with a side armor over 2) are only affected very rarely (roll of a 10 exactly, on a 20 sided dice, and only for certain types of artillery).  In the case of artillery (HE rounds) there are column shifts to the left for being in certain terrain (entrenched infantry, woods, town, suppressed target, woods, etc).Combat EngineersRules are given for combat engineers (placing and dealing with obstacles, such as abati, barbed wire, craters, dragon's teeth, tank ditches, and mine fields).  A discussion of, and rules on, different types of mines is present.AircraftRules are given for aircraft, with a view towards permitting supporting air actions that present ground support.  Detailed dog fighting rules are not present.And that's it for the rules.  More on the Vehicle and Weapon statistics, in the next article.So, what do I think of Jagdpanzer?  It is a game of it's time, but I do like how it abstracts some vehicle info (penetration and armor), and also how it keeps armor values to a minimum (averaging turret and hull, so that an armored vehicles has four armor values - front, side, rear, and top).  It plays fast.  The morale rules are playable, and give good results.My only regret - and this is largely from memory (I will have to check the rulebook again) is that there is no mechanism for recovering from Suppression (that I recall). It might have been a preferred house rule, but I seem to remember that we would use either a Command Control roll or a Morale Test to recover from Suppression (I can't find where in the rulebook it discusses this...Update! After talking with the author, I confirmed that it is a Morale Test that removes a Suppression result.Overall, and in light of how well the many different branches of WW2 combined arms land warfare is - these are really great rules.  A nice high resolution (low aggregation) wargame simulating WW2 ground combat, and it covers everything in elegant ways, that is still fun and easy to play."},
{"title": "Wargaming the Barbarian Kingdoms (6th and 7th century) - Part 3, Franks under Merovingian Rule", "date": "Saturday, April 14, 2018", "text": "The Franks, of course, are those Germanic tribes that were in the area previously called Gaul, and soon to become called France.  In the period we are looking at, for wargaming, they are ruled by the Merovingians, and the style of warfare during this time and for these peoples is definitely a telltale version of the tribal type infantry army, replacing the remnants of anything the Romans left during the last stages of antiquity - but starting to get a little more organized as the political units of the day get larger and more sophisticated.Brief history of the people and period:The Merovingian dynasty properly started towards the end of the 5th century, in 481.  That year is significant because Childeric, who had ruled the Merovingian tribe, among several tribes of the Franks, was succeeded in 481 by his son, Clovis I - and it was Clovis (Chlodowig) who united all of Gaul under Merovingian rule.   This will last until the year 751 (just outside our period, in the middle of the 8th century), when Pepin deposed the last Merovingian king, and established the Carolingian dynasty.During the reign of Clovis, the original territory he recieved from his father (Austrasia), was added to by his military victories at battles such as Soisson (the Gauls of Neustria, defeated in 486), and Vouille (the Visigoths of Aquitaine, north of the Iberian peninsula, in 507).  By the end of his reign, the kingdom of France was pretty large, indeed.From Wikipedia article on Merovingian dynastyClovis left the kingdom to his four sons, who defeated Burgundy in 532 at the battle of Autun, then captured the defeated Burgundian king (Godomar) in 534, and annexed Burgundy.  At this point, the only lands that could be called Frankish (German) that were outside the control of the Merovingian monarchs were Saxony and Frisia in the north, the Spanish Marches, Gascony, and Septimania (and Provence) in the south, the holdout german kingdoms of Bavaria, Carinthia and Lombardy in the southeast.  All those territories would come under Frankish rule, but not until the Carolingians began their expansion.A couple of interesting cultural and historical factors from this period.  The Muslim conquest would reach southern Europe for some time (end of the 6th century, roughly), so the tribes in the south and west that the Merovingians had troubles with were other German, Gothic and related successors to the failed Roman period.  The Lombards, distinctively, retained their paganism in this period.  Clovis himself (first king of the Merovingians) is considered to be the last of the Pagan kings of the Franks, because after his victories over the Alemani (in 496 and 506), he converted to Christianity, and his people (who hadn't already) followed suit.One of the aspects of Clovis' conversion is that he (under influence of his wife) adopted Catholicism, rather than the Arianism that was prevalent among the Goths, Vandals and Burgundians. This gave him (after the Alemani) something of a religious reason for subjugating his enemies. In addition it made the remaining Roman population loyal to him.Around the period of 540 or so, for a few years, there was a bad outbreak of Bubonic Plague, although this wouldn't be as devastating as the later Medieval outbreak in the 14th century would be (because of fewer large population concentrations) it would be bad enough, and since it hit the agricultural areas hardest, it would have had a huge impact on this post-antiquity economy - which would have kept military forces necessarily small for almost all the belligerents we are talking about.Wargaming the MerovingiansMerovingian Re-enactorLet's start out by taking a look at the DBA army list for the Merovingians.  If we are talking about the period from 481 to 751, this covers a couple of DBA lists.First,Early Franks, up until roughly 496 (corresponding, roughly, to the major unification under Clovis I with his defeat of the Alemani, and eventually setting up his capital at Paris) and then the Middle Franks.The Early Franks (II/72d) in DBA really reflect the post antiquity tribal quality of the warfare.  The army consists of one element of cavalry, and ten elements of warband, and one element of psiloi.  The cavalry element is the general - representing a Frankish leader and his comitatus.  The warbands are the tribal warriors (round shields, and spear and ax - or the), and the psiloi would be maybe slingers or throwers of the angon javelin.Their Alemani (II/72b) enemies (fought Clovis in 496 and 506) were similar - one cavalry element, seven warband elements, one psiloi - and the difference is that the Alemani had much better quality archery, so they receive three elements of bow, in addition to the psiloi element that might represent slingers or angon throwers.In both cases, the general and his comitatus can choose to fight dismounted (especially useful in the many forested areas of the region), in which case the cavalry element becomes another warband.The Middle Frankish list (III/5) covers the Merovingian Franks from the war with the Alemani up until the dominance of the Carolingian Mayers of the Palace (639).  This list (III/5) has two variants, corresponding roughly to the North and East, or Austrasian and Burgundian area (III/5a), and the South and West, or Neustria, Provence, and Aquitaine areas (III/5b).The first of these (III/5a) contains:  the general is either a Cavalry or Knight element, and there is an additional mounted element which can also be Cavalry or Knight.  There are  six elements of warband, and then three elements which may choose to be warband, or may be upgraded to spear, and finally one element of psiloi.The second of these (III/5b) contains: the same mounted elements as above (the general, and an additional element, each of which can be cavalry or knights), six elements of spear, again three additional elements which may be spear, or warband, and one element of psiloi.Here we see the growing sophistication of the armies, as the mounted troops become much more effective as knights (introduction of new equipment such as the stirrup, and better armor).  As the region gives way from dense forests to more and more agricultural land, the troops can find more uses to fight in a tighter formation - hence the spear elements (also representing the greater training available under rulers of larger armed forces).  In the south, more spears than warbands represents the terrain, as well as exposure to the Goths and other enemies.For miniatures - Baueda makes some excellent figures for the Carolingians, and they are promising Merovingian figures any day now.The Essex figures are quite gorgeous, but their \"Early Franks\" seem to be from a much earlier period (the era of the Roman Frankish Federates).  However, their Saxon, Frisian, Suevi and Bavarian line is just about perfect.  Here are some pictures of the figures from that line.Essex SXA1Essex SXA4Essex SXA2Old Glory 15s makes a very nice range of Carolingians - and the infantry, at least (and truly, most of the cavalry) is useable for at 15mm Merovingian army.In 28mm, one of the companies that is supporting a lot of Dark Ages gaming in recent years, is of course Gripping Beast.  As usually, they have a great offering for this period, and they would make a great army for a wargamer.Okay, so what is the compelling reason to wargame the Franks under Clovis (and his successors)?  Three reasons, immediately that I can think of.  First - if you are a fan of late antiquity/early medieval wargaming, and want to explore the earliest history of what would become Medieval France.  Second, because of the interesting foes that the Merovingians fought against.  And Third, the most practical reason - you can represent a Merovingian army pretty easily with a a reasonable collection of Dark Ages infantry and some cavalry.  Mounted Saxons work well.  You could use Normans in a pinch, although your opponent is likely to call foul on the shields...  Still, this gives you a new set of armies, history, and foes to explore with your dark ages infantry figures (hairy men, round shields, chainmail, and a variety of fierce weapons)."},
{"title": "15mm Napoleonic Game hosted at Williamsburg Muster", "date": "Friday, March 16, 2018", "text": "I ran two games at the Williamsburg Muster.  The first was a Napoleonic game in 15mm, using the Neil Thomas rules (the version from \"Wargaming: An Introduction\"), between a British army and a French army.The two armies were the same size (typical for NT rules), but the British were definitely mainly on the defensive, as they set up in an extended infantry line (with artillery) defending a church.  The French were assaulting the line, bringing their infantry up in column, while probing for local weakness with their artillery and cavalry.The tactical problem to solve here for the English is: There is nothing that can stand up to the French Heavy Cavalry.  The problem for the French is: How to succeed against the superior English firepower, while assaulting (and no numerical superiority)?British in Line, defending the church of San MiguelThe rules from the introduction book and the rules from the specialized Napoleonic book differ  in a few areas - one of them is how musketry (with special national characteristics) is treated, the other is how artillery (same consideration - special national characteristics) is treaty.  Here I think we used generic values, but a slight nod to British infantry musketry, since they used the 2 rank system vs. the more typical 3 rank system used by the French and most other nations.British Cavalry move out from behind the line.There were some other differences, notably the superior quality of the French Heavy Cavalry (only one unit, but what a unit!!).French Infantry respond to British CavalryThe French on the move past the village of Duertez.French Columns and French Cavalry, advancing.In all, it was a great game, the four players really enjoyed themselves, and we got to talk a lot about the typical characteristics of the Napoleonic period and Napoleonic wargaming."},
{"title": "Interesting Random Tables for RPGs", "date": "Sunday, January 28, 2018", "text": "Since the earliest days of D&D, random generation tables have been a part of the game. Among other things they would allow a dice-driven random selection of NPC and monster encounters, magic items, and other objects that a group of adventurers might find while moving through the fictional world.  One of the more interesting uses has been sets of tables to generate whole environments.  This has included random towns, cities, dungeons (especially) and whole continents and worlds.Excellent examples of this popped up very early not only in the original D&D books and supplements, but also in the excellent tables in the many early Judges Guild products (adventure settings and magazines). But the very best may have been Gary Gygax's dungeon generation tables in the 1st edition AD&D Dungeon Master's Guide.  Still loved and used.Other very cool examples include the terrain/continent generation tools from the earliest versions of the ICE Campaign Law book (which, along with Character Law, would form the link between their early Arms Law, Claw Law, and Spell Law books, and the later whole Rolemaster idea).  Many, many other type systems appeared in print in the explosion of supplements and magazines in the 80s golden age of RPGs.In recent years, many similar type offerings have been popping up both in Retro Clone RPG supplements, and the generally excellent sea of RPG blogs that aim at old school style roleplaying and DMing.  One of the most fun is the blog of  Jason Sholtis - the Dungeon Dozen  This a collection of many D12 tables of interesting (and sometimes whimsical) items to encounter in a fantasy RPG.  Jason has followed up the blog, with published collections of the tables (as of this writing, volume one is available in print or PDF, and volume two is coming soon).One thing about the tables of Jason, is that in terms of topic, they are all over the place. Objects, people, conditions, monsters, locations - he covers it all. A great index has been compiled over at Blessings of the Dice gods by Jeff Russell. This is a great index to Jason's work."},

{"title": "Wargaming the Barbarian Kingdoms (6th and 7th century) - Part 2, Visigoths", "date": "Sunday, August 13, 2017", "text": "Visigoths - originally, as Feoderati under the Romans, they established area of rule in Gaul and Spain. The early (but exciting) campaigns of Alaric I predate the period considered here.  In 507, however, the Franks, under Clovis I beat the Goths (under Alaric II) at the Battle of Vouille  Visigoth rule in Gaul was at an end, but the Frank's were established as a kingdom that would give us Charlemagne, France, Germany, and a lot of different kinds of cheese.The Visigoths, however, survived the loss of Gaul.  They had a kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula (Spain, or Hispania).  There, they survived (and in harmony with the rest of Christendom after converting from Arianism in 589) until being overrun by the Moors (Berbers and Arabs up from North Africa) in about the year 711 or 712 (the Mozarbic Chronicle of 741, written in Latin, is unclear).  That was the Battle of Guadalete between King Roderic of the Goths, and Tariq ibn Ziyad.Battle of GuadaleteSo, for about two hundred years, there was a gothic kingdom in Spain. It gave us a lot of interesting Gothic architecture and early cathedrals, but not a lot of details on military practices.Tariq Ibn ZiyadLooking at what wargames have to offer on the Western Goths is interesting.  Again, turning to the original DBA list (as a conceptual distillation of the 1982 WRG army lists, and benefitting from eight years of further research and debate) we see that there is an infantry core of five elements. These can be either spear, or warband, or a mix of warband and auxilia - depending on which allies or sources you prefer. But that establishes a solid infantry battle line, supported by two units of skirmishers (Psiloi), and finally a solid mounted contingent of four units of four Cavalry units, and a Knight (general) unit.  King RodericThis could easily represent the army of Roderic, at the battle of Guadalete.  There, his solid infantry line was a match for the Moors, but he lost because his right cavalry wing under a disgruntled commander abandoned the field allowing the numerous, but lighter, Moorish cavalry to flank the infantry line.  Legend replaces the commander with Count Julian, who turned traitor because his daughter was raped at Roderic's court, but this (while a great medieval narrative) is unsubstantiated.Visigothic Warriors - from a later English sculpting method.Refighting Guadalete as a decisive battle that ended Christian rule in western Spain, until the Reconquista, is a worthy war gaming goal, but the lack of other major foes makes the prospect of building a large Visigothic army seem like a futile enterprise.  It is, however, a great example of a balanced army from the Barbarian Kingdoms era.  There are, of course, lots of Possible match ups against sixth century foes, such as Byzantines, Ostrogoths, or even early Andalusians from the other parts of Spain.For figures, standard dark age infantry (metal conic helms, round shields, and either sword, spear, or bow) make the battle line and Psiloi easy to model. Likewise, the cavalry (cloaks, metal helms, round shields) are readily available. The older Minifigs heavy barbarian horse and heavy barbarian infantry are nearly perfect, as well as many modern manufacturers.A nice set of pictures of a painted army is here.is here."},
{"title": "Wargaming the Barbarian Kingdom Period (6th century AD) - Part 1, Ostrogoths", "date": "Tuesday, July 25, 2017", "text": "The story of the Ostrogoths is a very interesting one, including their origin, and how they became to be considered a single people, but from a military/wargaming perspective, their war against the Romans (especially the Eastern Romans, or the Byzantines, as their identity was coalescing following the fall of Western Rome) in and around Italy is the most interesting, and where we find some potential scenarios and campaigns for good games.The eastern Goths had come into Italy in the previous century, and held (as the result of a number of successful sieges and sacks) many of the key cities of the peninsula.  In a period of almost 20 years, under Justinian, the Byzantines waged the \"Gothic War\" in order to restore these areas back to Roman (Byzantine) rule.  This lasted from 535 to 554 AD.  Some Gothic strongholds in Northern Italy would hold out for another 8 years, not falling until 562.The earlier period is the successful sweep of the Byzantines up the peninsula, crossing from Africa, and securing a number of strong strategic points up the Italian peninsula.Early Phase of the Gothic WarBattles of this period feature an early Ostrogothic army, against a Justinian Byzantine army.  The fighting is suitable for somewhat larger battles, and also (due to the rough country and terrain of Italy) for smaller raids and skirmishes, that no doubt took place between Byzantine forces, and smaller Gothic strongholds and military units.  Eventually the Gothic stronghold at Ravenna would be conquered by the Byzantines in 539/540.This leads to the second phase of the Gothic War (540-554 or event 562) where a revived Gothic push back against the Byzantines takes place under the Gothic leader of Totila.Totila, painted by Salviati in 1549During the push back phase of the Ostrogoths reclaiming the initiative from the Byzantines, the great Byzantine general Narses would suffer because he also was dealing with encroachments from the Franks and the Alamanni.  In 554 AD, Narses was succesful against the Goths, at the battle of Vesuvius (also known as the Battle of Mons Lactarius), by defeating the army of Totila, and also killing the king.  The Goths, after this, retreated north into Austria.In the end, however, Byzantines were successful against the Goths in Italy, but it was a fleeting victory.  First, it kept the strength of the Byzantines from dealing with problems in the north and the east.  Second, once the Goths were subjugated, the area was swept over again, by another German group, the Lombards, who would prove to be a lot harder to dislodge (that task being left to the Carolingians).Battle of Mons Lactarius in 554AD, painted by Adolf Zick (~1900AD)The representation of the Ostrogoths in miniature wargaming is pretty interesting, even if the army only has a few distinctive troop types.  The DBA rules give a pretty good indication of what we can surmise from history (and how rules writers interpret that history into wargaming terms).  DBA (original) has Army number 86 (Italian Ostrogothic 493-554AD) with 6x elements of Knights, 4x elements of Psiloi, or skirmish infantry, and finally 2x elements which could be either formed as 2x more Psiloi elements, or 2x spear elements.  Before looking at how they are represented in other rules, it is worth considering the basics presented by the DBA list.  First, is the cavalry. In a gothic army, that is the Ostrogoths that settled in Italy, or the Visigoths that settled in Spain, and the various places these two broad groups came from (stretching all the way back to Northern Eurooe, in what is modern day Sweden), the army was mainly focused on the Warriors being mounted, and fighting in a close order, for shock value.  The other members of the population, as well as absorbed and allied peoples, would generally fight on foot.  Mainly these were loose order skirmishes, designated to a role supporting the mounted warriors. But in the case of some absorbed peoples (like the remnants of local Romanized infantry, which would fight in a dense shielded formation, with sword and spear) the foot troops might actually fight in a formed up formation, not entirely unsuited for a place in the battle line.  Still, however, the main branch is the mounted warriors. This is very much the same as what we find in the original 1982 WRG Army List Book Two entry.  There, the army gets a mandatory 44-72 Gothic Cavalry (start at Heavy Cavalry, but some portion can be upgraded to Extra Heavy Cavalry, all with javelin/light spear and shield).  Add to those figures, up to 90 additional Gothic Cavalry (which start at Medium Cavalry, but can up upgraded to Heavy Cavalry, and can be upgraded to match the morale grade of the earlier lot, Irregular B).  This makes for a very strong cavalry section (as you would expect, given the history of the army at battles like Taginae and Mons Lactarius, where the Ostrogoths fought against Byzantines and Germans that countered them with a reinforced infantry center), but without infantry it will have problems against a mixed foe who can reinforce a central battleline of heavy infantry.  The only real infantry presence the Goths have is that of the Gothic Archery (presented in the WRG list as up to 100 Light Infantry, which can remain as Irregular D or be upgraded to Irregular C).This is a very interesting army, for a wargamer, because of it's strange mix of troop types.  The heavy cavalry is very good, and may be a precursor for later armies in the post-dark ages period.  But, as it is only supported by light infantry archers, it might be tough against some armies.  Where this will do well (a-historically) is in games the give too much credence to archery, and games that do not provide structural problems to cavalry fighting deep formation infantry without support.  I own (and fight with) an Ostrogoth DBA army, but I have not yet tried it with Might of Arms, or Terry Gore's rules.  It should be (at least) an educational matchup against a sixth century Byzantine army."},

Housman, 1922 I mentioned that I have fallen in with the old wargaming club, Old Dominion Military Society, which is now actively gaming again on a weekly basis.  Our summer convention (Guns of August) is being hosted at the Virginia War Museum.  We have plans underway for the new winter convention (Williamsburg Muster), returning to its regular February timeslot.  The local club is also talking about monthly game days (game nights?) where we rent out or acquire access to a large venue, for some big, serious, miniatures gaming.  Maybe at the Museum?  Maybe at a local community hall?  Still working the details.Miniature gaming, so far, has been of the Thursday night variety.  Which means, typically, smallish games.  Some ODMS members have hosted great things - (The Rules with No Name, FrostGrave, Wings of Glory, DBA, etc etc), and this week we have some Ancients happening, and next week we have some Napoleonics happening.  All very good.Boardgaming has been quite fun, and with our new game room (the den, or family room, in our new house is dedicated as a game room, with storage for all our board games, and a nice game table, some chairs, a couch, and a computer desk), we have been playing on a regular basis, as a family, and with some guests.   During the move, the inventory and packing/unpacking experience showed us that we have a lot of games that we really like, but haven't played in a while.  And some that we have never played.  To address those issues, we made a list of \"games we have not played lately, but want to\" and will be using that to schedule Wednesday night family game night. Several recent games of Fantastiqa have been quite fun, and looking forward to some Terra Mystica and maybe some Archon and/or Tempus.Roleplaying has been discussed, especially with our return to the old stomping grounds, and so many of the players we love playing with from years ago.  There is talk of \"getting the band back together\" with some of the our old regulars, in an old fashioned roleplaying game (either fantasy, or maybe sci-fi).  Nothing yet, but details will appear in this fine publication.Planned upcoming game activities -Guns of August is going to be in a public place - so it will be a little bit different.  I am treating this as a recruiting and/or community outreach opportunity for both wargaming in general, and for the game club (ODMS).  I will be hosting four (introductory level) wargames, and am in the process of preparing handouts for each, to introduce some history, wargaming, and the rules being used.1. Introduction to Medieval Wargames - very similar to the games I hosted at Guns of August 2016, with two games going on at once (maybe, Vikings/Saxons, and Crusaders/Saracens).  I'll be using the Neil Thomas introductory rules, and am working on a handout for this game.2. Wargaming the Revolutionary War - I will probably use a smaller version of the scenario I ran at Thanksgiving 2015, which was a fictional Southern Campaign battle, set in South Carolina 1780.  I won't be using Black Powder for this, because I want it completely friendly to newcomers and kids.  Either some homebrew rules (Patriot's Blood) or Neil Thomas Napoleonic rules adapted for the purpose.3. Introduction to Renaissance Wargaming - This one will be a lot like the first one, with two battles (four armies), and using the Neil Thomas rules.  One of the battles will most likely be French/Imperialist vs. Italians.  The other might be English Civil War.  Again, similar to the solo Renaissance game I did back in 2016.  The main feather here is the history of the period, and trying to get people interested, so I am working on a nice handout.4. Introduction to Medieval Wargaming - This one is a conundrum for me.  I have a couple of ideas.  The first is to do the same thing I plan for number 1 above, but maybe with different armies.  The second is to do a 28mm scale game using Lion Rampant, to show what medieval games are like, at that weird mix between skirmish and full army battles (such as LR, but also Saga and some others).  The third idea is to use the Chainmail rules such as my recent games supporting the Lord of the Manor project, and use the handout session to show the connection between miniatures games and the later roleplaying game revolution.  Still deciding this one.Lots more coming up, including finishing some of the projects here (dark ages wargaming, retro reviews, etc).  Watch this space."},
{"title": "Wargamer's Guide to the English Civil War - review", "date": "Tuesday, May 2, 2017", "text": "This is another review in the Once and Future Rules series, of wargame rules that are out of print, but that got a lot of play at one time (at least, in the clubs and groups I played in since the early 1980s).I have mentioned my love for renaissance gaming in general, and the English Civil War period in particular, several times during this series of reviews.  This time, I would like to review a set of miniature rules that I came to in the mid 1980s, although they were first published in 1974 (a second edition came out in 1977, and that is the edition that I own).  These rules are the 'Wargamer's Guide to the English Civil War' by Bill Protz.  These are still available for sale on Bill's website, along with some of his other excellent rules.Curiously enough, the first edition of Bill Protz' ECW wargaming masterpiece (i.e. - the volume I am reviewing here) came out in 1974.  It was published by the Myers and Zimmermann wargaming house of Z&M Publishing (Myers and Zimmermann were the lads behind the Angriff rules, and they went on to form a publishing house for wargaming rules - mostly from their neck of the woods up in Milwaukee).The interesting thing about the publishing year, is that it is one year after the first appearance of Cavaliers and Roundheads, by Gygax and Perren (published by TSR).  From Bill's website, he got interested in the English Civil War, as a wargaming topic, because of Cavaliers and Roundheads (C&R), and also the availability of the Hinchliffe ECW figures.  I seem to recall that TSR needed cash for their new publishing idea, the Dungeons & Dragons boxed set, and that they rushed out C&R for publication in order to raise cash.  The English Civil War must have been a popular period at this time, to not only inspire two great rulesets coming out within a year of each other, but also to convince Mssrs. Kuntz and Gygax at TSR that they could raise capital from selling an ECW rule book.  But they did.  And, furthermore, the Protz book (WGECW) is still highly regarded, and as mentioned above, still for sale.The English Civil War continues to be a very interesting topic for wargamers, as it not only features in generic, broadbased rules sets such as DBR and Field of Glory Renaissance, but also continues to inspire specific rulesets in popular series' such as Warhammer English Civil War (sadly, now out of print, like the rest of the Warhammer historical series), and Pike and Shotte from Warlord Games (which covers the broader Renaissance, but which has an ECW specific period book - 'To Kill a King' -  due for release the month that this article is being written).  Of course, it has been, and continues a period of interest for me, as well.  On to the rules . . .WGECW is presented as a 5x8 booklet, 76 pages long.  The book is divided up, generally, into three sections: (1) is an introduction, which gives a very brief overview of the English Civil War, and also reasons for wargaming in this period, (2) is the section containing the rules themselves, and (3) is a series of appendices that introduce information about army composition, painting and uniform information, rules for fighting sieges, and other bits of extra information.  It is this third section that lifts this book from being just a tactical rulebook, to being a wargamer's guide.  C&R did this, somewhat, but not to the extent that Bill Protz has done here.Initial Concepts One thing to establish up front, is that the miniatures within the units don't really matter.  Well, that is to say, they matter because it is a miniatures game, and they matter because they bring the splendor and pageantry to the wargame, but they don't matter in the sense of combat being based on particular figures in contact, or even specifically how many figures there are in a unit.  What does matter, is the units CR or Combat Rating.  Now this is typically computed initially from the number of miniatures in a unit (and the point value of those miniatures), but it will change up and down with circumstance, and in fact, the initial CR of a unit might be increased by 25% if the unit is elite.  The unit's CR is what matters, in WGECW.  Combat effectiveness is based on the CR, and losses are subtracted from the CR (although the author suggests that miniatures be removed from a unit, in proportion to CR losses that the unit undergoes). The CR is calculated from points values of the miniatures in a formation.  This includes extra points for figures such as officers, flag bearers, and sergeants.  For a mixed formation, such as an ECW formation with a body of Pikemen, and perhaps two flanking bodies of Musketeers, each of those divisions would have its own CR calculated and recorded on a unit roster.Scale and Unit TypesGame scale is given at 1 inch to 15 yards for the ground, 1 figure to 20 men for the troops.  Basic types of figures are foot, horse, and artillery.Foot troops can be Open Ordered (such as skirmishing forlorn hope), Ordered (typical musket and pike formation), Double Ordered (half the depth of Ordered formations), or Close Ordered (tightly packed infantry, in order to defend against enemy cavalry).  Finally, there is the possibility of a Ring formation (like a hedgehog, or square formation).Horse troops can be either Ordered (such as typical charging cavalry), or Open Ordered (such as dragoons or other cavalry, spread out in order to screen), or Caracole (designed to allow pistol fire and recall against an enemy unit).The rules give basing sizes for troops, which generally doesn't change for the different ordering listed above, EXCEPT for Close Ordered Infantry.  In that case, the player is to remove half the stands of the unit from the table, but to record and remember what their CR is - they have just gotten denser.Foot unit stands represent three ranks of troops, and Ordered and Close Ordered units are 6 ranks deep, so they should be two miniature ranks (or stands) deep.  Double Ordered infantry are only 3 ranks deep, so are only one stand deep (called Double Ordered, because by halving the depth, they double the length of the formation line).  Horse units and artillery have their methods of representing Ordering on the tabletop.  Open Ordered units, it should be pointed out, have the stands dispersed by a short gap between them - typical skirmishing formation representation.Turn SequenceThe game turn is divided up into a sequence of events.  Since this is a game that practices simultaneous movement, it features order writing.  Regular readers of this blog will know my affection for simultaneous movement and order writing (similar to my affection for root canal).  When we played these rules, so many years ago, we would write general battlefield orders at the beginning of the game, and our specific turn orders were only changes to those, as well as announcing charges etc.  It helps to have a referee.The sequenced events of the turn, however, are these:Both sides write down orders for their units.Both sides read out their orders, alternating who goes first every other turn.Moves are performed simultaneously according to orders.Skirmish Fire is assessed, and casualties immediately calculated and removed.Artillery Fire is assessed, and casualties immediately calculated and removed.Other Small Arms Fire is assessed, and casualties immediately calculated and removed.Melee is adjudicated and resolved.Turn is complete.Morale tests can be triggered in any of the firing or melee events.MovementMovement is quite straight forward, and is based on some simple charts showing inches, based on the type of movement (and troop type) performing it.  There are some simple reductions and additions based on different circumstances (road movement, move and fire, direction change, etc).  There are some specifics to be followed if a unit of musketeers is going to be firing by introduction (that is, as the ranks fire, and are replaced from the rear, that they slowly move forward), or extroduction (the same, only the unit as a whole slowly moves backward, as firers run to the rear of their file).Movement for cavalry is slightly more involved, although the chart is every bit as simple.  For mounted troops, the player must determine if the horses are trotting, cantering or galloping.   Rules are given about accelerating through these different states.  A horse, cannot, for instance, go from a simple stand-still to galloping in one move.  It must start at trotting, then the next turn can proceed to cantering, and finally to galloping.  As with foot troops, there are some simple additions or reductions based on circumstance and operations.Finally, there is a similar table, with similar rules for artillery pieces of different sizes, and different situations.Small Arms FireOnce the type of fire (regular, introduction/extroduction, pistol caracole, etc) is determined, then the number of figures, and their CR, can be assessed.  The following procedure is used to determine the number of casualties (expressed in CR reduction to the target unit) is finalized.Determine CRDetermine RangeToss 1 dieCheck Die Adjustment Chart for modsCross reference die results with range, to get an Effectiveness LetterCross reference the effect letter, and the CR firing on the Small Arms Casualty Chart, to get the casualty integer.Modify the casualty integer by modifiers on the final casualty adjustment chart.Take the final modified casualty integer, and multiply it by the point value of the target troops, and deduct the result from the target unit's CROne final consideration, is that armored units (foot and horse) have a reduced calculus of how much total CR damage is inflicted.Artillery FireThe procedures for doing Artillery Fire, are somewhat different from small arms fire. First,  determine your target, and then based on range there is a chance for the artillery shot to go awry.  If at short range, it is a definite hit, but at medium and long range there is a chance to miss.Second, determine the ranks penetrated (light guns penetrate 2 ranks, medium guns penetrate 3, and heavy guns will penetrate 4).  Third, for each rank penetrated, there is a one point casualty integer, and these are all summed up (so for 3 ranks penetrated, there is a total casualty integer of 3).  This is reduced by terrain (such as firing up- or down-hill).  Finally, multiply the casualty integer times the CR of the troops hit, and reduce this from the target unit.  This total amount is reduced by half in a number of situations.The final CR total is subtracted from the target unit's CR.There are similar procedures for other types of shot (the above, is for regular round shot, that does damage by bouncing through multiple ranks of soldiers, and killing them).  Shot types include exploding shell and langridge (case, or hail) shot.MeleeNot surprising, the CR system is core to how melee engagements are adjudicated in these rules.  Each side calculates their current CR (lots of modifiers, such as Horse vs. non-Horse gets multiplied by 125%).  Then, the winner of the melee is determined.  This is done by each side rolling 2d6, and multiplying the result by their unit's CR.  The high score wins the melee combat.  Now, casualties are inflicted as a percentage of the original CR (not the product of the CR multiplied by dice).  The losing side will deduct (from their base CR score) an amount equal to 25% of the winner's CR.  The winning side will deduct 10% of the loser's CR.  The loser then takes, and applies, a morale test.  There are rules for fleeing, pursuits, and how officers affect things.  That is it - it is easy to play out melee combat, and although the impact of multiplying your CR by a 2d6 roll at first blush seems like there can be a lot of variability, the actual casualties (CR deduction) and morale results are more important.Example combat - Lets say a Royalist Pike and Shot unit, with 12 pikemen (including 2pt command figures), and 12 musketeers will have a total CR of 36.  It is facing a Parliamentarian unit with 8 pikemen and 16 musketeers, or a total CR of 32.  The Royalist player rolls a 7 on the dice, and a total of (7x36) or 252.  The Parliamentarian player rolls a 9 on the dice, and a total of (9x32) or 288.  The Parliamentarian unit wins.  The Royalist unit subtracts (.25 x 32) 8 points from it's CR.  The Parliamentary unit subtracts (.10 x 36) 4 points from it's CR.  The Royalist unit, as the losing unit, will have to test moraleExtrasThe rulebook is about half full of appendices. The first few of these go over how units should be organized on the wargames table, and a short guide to painting and flags, as well as advice to the 15mm player (a new scale, for the most part, in the early 1970s).But then the appendices get more interesting.  There is a subset of rules for doing siege games.  These cover the specifics of affecting fortifications and buildings, as well as rules for grenadoes and other siege equipment.  A series of six different classes of storming/sieging are described, as scenarios and what is to be done in each (as well as victory conditions, and how to represent that sort of siege on the tabletop).There is a set of notes regarding the organization of armies and the proportion of units, etc, in the years of the First Civil War (1642-1646).  And finally, there are some blank and sample unit rosters (showing a clean way to record unit CR and orders/status).  Lastly, the book ends with a nice glossary of ECW military terms.Assessment/ConclusionI owned this book before I owned either Forlorn Hope or 1644 (both of which I played more than these rules).  In fact, the only renaissance/ECW rules I owned before these were the George Gush rules from WRG (and, eventually, Universal Soldier).  I only played these a few times, but I returned to the book for information about the period, and units, artillery types, etc many times over while in my early years of ECW playing.  This was one of those rulebooks that back then (in the 1980s) was in many of the wargaming shops I visited, and also on the rack at vendor booths at wargaming conventions. I saw it a lot, but unfortunately the people I played with did not use it.One of the things I found disconcerting (more below, as I discuss this effect in regards to shooting) is the fact that the unit is kept track of by its CR, and casualties and effects are based on total CR engaged, and not individual stands or figures.  I understand the reason for this, with mixed units of pike and shot, but it seemed to introduce as many difficulties as it solved, see my comments below about shooting (both musketry and artillery).The basic scale and representation of the game (in terms of figures per unit, movement and shooting ranges, and also turn/time sequence) works very well.  But for some reason, these rules never quite were the thing in the group I played with. I include it here, because of the impact the book had, and Bill Protz's excellent writing about wargames, not so much because I played it so often (I played almost all the other ECW rules mentioned in this review series - Forlorn Hope, Cavaliers and Roundheads, Universal Soldier, Hackbutt and Pike, and the forthcoming Gush rules and 1644 - more than I played the Wargamer's Guide to the English Civil War).  Eventually, I would get other resources on wargaming units and uniforms and army lists, etc (Forlorn Hope was excellent in that regard, but also great books from Caliver), but early on - this is the book that made me fall in love with wargaming the period.  Even if the rules in this book did not. Pros/Cons for Musketry and ArtilleryOkay, this seems (to me) to be a bit overly complicated, mostly because of the basic structure of WGECW.  The casualty integer is a number of enemy figures killed.  But the final step, of converting it back to points and then deducting it from the CR, is because of the requirement to discuss everything about a unit in terms of CR, rather than in terms of figures.  I give the author (Bill Protz) the benefit of the doubt, because there are benefits of doing a unit as a whole, even when it is comprised of disparate parts (like pike, officers, halberdiers, and shot all in a large battalia, for instance).  That is always hard to do, and rules for the period (even the latest modern rules) always struggle hard in how to do hybrid units.  The CR system is an elegant way to do it, it just didn't appeal to the people I was playing with."},
{"title": "Card based system for wargames deployment", "date": "Saturday, April 29, 2017", "text": "One of the features I like about the various strains of card driven board wargames, is the decision involved in playing a card for activation.  Clearly this does not apply to all card driven systems, but the ones I am thinking of have cards with multiple options on them, that the player must choose from when playing a card.  Does the player use the card for bringing on reinforcements, or to activate an event, or for a special ability/modifier, or simply to activate units/leaders already in the game? This seems like a useful thing to try and bring into a miniatures wargame, to put a little spin on that old standby scenario - the meeting engagement.  So what I am considering here is a system of cards, each with two different pieces of information on it. Each player would, in turn, place one of these cards, from a small handful they have to choose from, on the table, in one of three different sectors.eventually, each player will play two cards in each sector.  Each sector would have one card, for that player's forces, that corresponds to one of the two categories of information on he cards (so, one card for forces, and one card for deployment).The first piece of information is a partial basic order of battle. It would list a number of units that would belong to one of three sectors on the battlefield (left, center, right).  Depending on the period and the number of units a player owns, this could be tailored so that a personal collection could provide the figures needed. This could easily be three or four units, or as many as a dozen, depending on period, scale, and rules used.The second piece of information would control the deployment of forces in that sector.  Are the forces arrayed in a single line? Some units off board? In column on a road?  Dug in with scouts deployed?  Again lots of possibilities, depending on period, scale, and rules.An example might be this, for Blue Army's Left Flank... (Fictional situation, of course)Forces Card: Infantry Division, 6 units of line infantry, 1 medium gun battery. Deployment Card: Probing Line, All units in a battle line, 12\" in from base edge.  Up to two subunits (converged flank companies, or detached squadrons) can be deployed up to 24\" in from base line.  I can see this used in several ways. The easiest, and maybe most interesting, is to deal out six cards to each player, and they need to use all six.  The second way, is to deal three cards each, and as a player places a card, they draw a new one.  Other possibilities exist, but in all cases, the players roll initiative, and high roller places one card, and then the players alternate until all six cards for each side are played.I am looking forward to trying a set of these, maybe for Napoleonics first. Loads and loads of possibilities exist, including special event cards, special decks for special scenarios, and ancillary effects of cards, like logistical conditions, weather, or affects to limit or increase command.A neat project to ponder.I have found a nice blog, by Guy Halsall, on his wargaming activities. Dr. Halsall is an academic that makes a fine study of sixth century history, and starting back in the late 1990s he combined his history pursuits with his wargaming and published a series on King Arthur.  Much of the series found its way into Wargames Illustrated, all of it is on his blog.Halsall goes on to complete a lengthy, and excellent (once he moves away from the touchy subject of Morris) series on both Arthur and the wargaming of Arthur inspired scenarios.  He has a nice introduction to campaigning, here giving a set of simple mapless rules (but with excellent scenario generator guidelines), and also a set of map based campaign (more detailed, naturally) rules. He discusses lists and rules (as I had done earlier here  but while I chose to compare lists against each other, he is comparing them to what he projects to be proper warfare for the period, based on his scholarly research).  In his discussion of rules, he gives kudos to Dan Mersey (Glutter of Ravens) and to Simon McDowall (Goths, Huns and Romans), both of which I highly regard.In short, a great article series. Halsall's historical work is top drawer, and even his criticism of Morris is well placed (he takes down one of my favorites, John Morris, for writing history that is more of the \"enjoyable narrative\" rather than the \"rigorous scholarship\" type of work).  I am forced to agree with his criticism, even if I have a strong fondness for The Age of Arthur. For me, as a wargamer, I am perfectly fine with a strong narrative version of a potential historical Arthur.  It was not an especially literate time, so the lack of much literary evidence doesn't bother me - and an actual King Arthur is not necessary to me as much as a potential Arthur that is consistent with what we do know about the history. I find very appealing the notion of an Arthur-like figure in the sixth century keeping alive the spark of Romano-civilization against the inevitable sweep back into Germanic paganism.  And so it follows that I would want my wargaming to be based on that idea. It is my world view, and my sense of myth and legend of the West.So, I will stick with Morris, and Arthur, warts and all.  And still enjoy the great work of Guy Halsall, as well."},
{"title": "Taking Stock - 15mm Collections pt. 6 - 19th Century", "date": "Wednesday, April 26, 2017", "text": "Wargaming topics and possible theaters of battle in the 19th century are extremely varied and provide for a lot of exciting gaming possibilities.  One of the most popular is of course the American Civil War.  But not for me, I have tended to avoid that conflict ( I had a collection in 25mm, but I only used them for imagi-nations gaming).This period, from the perspective of military operations and wargaming potential, is fantastic.  It is the century that sees musketry evolve from a weapon of mass application (with little precision), into the dominant force on the battlefield (as we evolve from the age of muskets, to the age of rifles).  The introduction of the railroad and mass production also mean that armies and logistics are evolving, so that operational campaigns are very different.  Naval capability changes from being wind and muscle driven, to being steam driven - which means that imperial and global colonialism is not only possible, but commonplace (with the colonial wars that go along with it).I will include in this listing a few armies from the very early (pre-WW1) 20th Century.Mexican-American WarThis is a big enough collection to put on a 6-8 player game. Maybe a thousand Mexican figures, and maybe eight hundred Americans and Texans.  All painted, recently rebased.Mahdi RebellionThis is a larger scale (in terms of larger scale battles) and more serious study of the two parts of the River War (as Churchill called it) than my 28mm TSATF collection ( which is, appropriately, for small scale skirmish engagements).  I have British (painted), Egyptians (unpainted, but also suitable for the Arabi Revolt), and Mahdists (hundreds painted, but hundreds not painted).Zulu WarProbably not worth mentioning except for an impressive stash of very nice, but unpainted, Zulus. Hundreds of 'em.American Indian WarsThis is a recent acquisition for me, a set of very nice (but individually mounted, so suitable for skirmish gaming) figures including US cavalry forces (mounted and dismounted), and a large selection of American Indian figures.  There are leaders and a variety of figures for both sides.  I have not gamed with these yet, but I am planning on trying The Tomahawk and the Flame, Pony Wars, and/or Hey You in the Jail (one of my favorites, now available as a PDF download).Spanish American WarA few years back, Patrick Wilson re-released the Richard Houston Lyzard's Grin collection. I bought in. I have a few hundred figures, all painted nicely by John Callahan. Both sides, and big enough for a modest game. No Philippines or Moro figures.Boxer RebellionVery nice Old Glory 15s, this is at heart a nice, large collection of unpainted Boxers, and some Europeans. Started this collection to take advantage of Americans (from above), and Russians and Japanese (both from below).Russo-Japanese WarAnother nice OG15s set, painted (by me) and large enough for a meaningful game. Maybe a dozen infantry units per side, with 2 or 3 cavalry and artillery units for each side. Many more troops for Russians. In addition, maybe another dozen units each side, of infantry.This series includesPart 1 - Ancients Part 2 - MedievalsPart 3 - RenaissancePart 4 - 18th CenturyPart 5 - Napoleonics Part 6 - 19th Century (this article)"},
{"title": "Medieval Periods - Middle Dark Ages (6th and 7th centuries)", "date": "Sunday, April 16, 2017", "text": "Following on my first article about wargaming in the various sub periods of the Medieval Age, I would like to address what I am here referring to as the middle Dark Ages.  For me, this is roughly the 6th and 7th centuries, so definitely in a Post (Western) Roman setting, but one where the rise of new entities and the rise of Byzantium provide rich war gaming possibilities. As with the first article, I remain focused on Europe.As far as I know, there is no common reference to this period, at least as a period distinct from either the earlier dark ages, or the later dark ages.  If anything, the earlier dark ages, and this period (I am thinking of approximately the 6th and 7th centuries) are part of what is usually referred to as Late Antiquity, although that really stretches back further than I wanted to (Late Antiquity is usually 300-700 AD).But here I am talking about the 6th and 7th centuries.  In the early period (5th century, into the Age of Arthur.  To me that is the interesting activity going on in that period (from a European perspective) for wargaming.  In this period, there are really three things going on that provide for good wargaming.  As I see them these are:beginning of the 6th), I covered the Consolidation of the Barbarian/Germanic KingdomsMuslim Conquest (starting in the 7th century, but lasting into the 8th)Byzantium Ascendency, starting with Justinian in the 6th century As with the other Medieval periods, although infantry is still a very common component of armies of this period, the strength of cavalry is one of the hallmarks of many Medieval military systems (at least for me). That was the reason why I thought of the Romano-British as an example of a very early Medieval army (even though, it is extremely Roman, and infantry heavy, in flavor).So, from a wargaming perspective (although just the history of this period, leaving aside gaming for an instant, is itself completely fascinating) here is what I see for the three periods.  I think I might list things like miniatures rules, board games, and army lists for each in separate posts.Barbarian KingdomsThese are large groups of (mostly) Germanic people's, or confederacies of people's, that were occupying lands in or on the border of the (former) Western Roman territories. They either had been invited to settle and become feoderates by the Romans, or else migrated in on their own, or (as in the case of Theoderic) would be contracted to come in by the Eastern Emperors. Because there are lots of clashes, both with remnants of the Western empire, and with other barbarian kingdoms, there is a lot of wargaming potential here.  Some of the people's I am thinking of (although there are many, many others):Ostrogoths - the Eastern Goths, mostly in and around ItalyVisigoths - the Western (or Bright) Goths, mostly in and around the Iberian lands, filling the space previously occupied by Vandals and SueviFranks - Extremely successful on both sides of the Danube, and against other tribes/confederacies, this period includes the Merovingians.Saxons - As in the earlier period, this may also include related peoples such as the Jutes and Angles, both in Britain (which is now becoming, finally, Angle-land, or England) and back in Europe.  On the British Isles, the series of struggling Kingdoms form the Heptarchy, although rarely is it exactly seven kingdoms.And non-Germanics from the East - Alans, Avars, Huns, etc.  There are a lot of miniature wargaming possibilities here, but also some board gaming titles as well.  Right away, I am reminded of Barbarian, Kingdom and Empire, as well as Catan: Struggle for Rome (a great game, but maybe not a wargame?).  Possibly Rise and Fall  but possibly not (and it is very similar to the already mentioned BKE).  A game I used to play quite a bit is the area control game, Attila.Muslim ConquestStarting in the early part of the seventh century, the armies of the Prophet and his successors provide a history that is ripe with opportunities for Wargamers who want to recreate the battles of this period.  This is divided up into an early expansion period, starting with the battle of Bedr, in 624 (two years after the flight of the Prophet to Medina) and ending in 661 when Muawiya Uthman had the Prophet's son in law (Ali) killed in the civil war for succession.  Muawiya then formed the first Caliphate.  The armies of Islam, with roots in a popular religious undertaking, necessarily had a lot of simple (but effective) foot elements, but also (and increasingly as time went on) both a professional infantry core and large amounts of mounted troops developed.  The Arab cavalry favored the Lance, although there are some Persian elements that use the bow.  This is, tactically, a very interesting army.It clashed, of course, with many of the other armies described in this article, so a Wargamer seeking to develop a collection for this period, would have a lot of scenario possibilities if he were to include the elements that make up this army. A very useful collection of essential troops, that would serve for representing this army over many centuries, would be a decent sized collection of Arab spear, Arab archers, and Lance armed Arab horse. As the conquest settles into an imperial mode in the later part of this period (starting with the establishment of the caliphate) other troops can be added in, representing absorbed people's. This includes horse archers among other things, and even extends to elephants.One of the more interesting enemies of the Arab Conquest, of course, is the Sassanid Persians.  This fantastic army will be described in a later article on the Arab Conquest. Board wargames about this period are rare, and I am only aware of a few. There was a Canadian Papercut games.  More recently, there was, in Freng from Griffon Games, a good looking design called Au Nom d'ALLAH that covers the expansion period from 632-732 AD.  Finally, and this is the one most accessible I think (from the preview material), is the title Apocalypse in the East  from Against the Odds magazine, to be published in 2017. It is about the ten year struggle between the first Caliphate and the Byzantines. Victory Point Games is working up an excellent solitaire, called The First Jihad which should be published soon.Simulations game back in the early 1980s called Jihad, but I don't think it has a following any longer. More recently, three titles come to mind. There was a game in 2007 called Caliphate, that was never quite finished, but is available as a free print and play download from ByzantiumAs the surviving successor to Rome, the empire in the east begins this period with an army very much in the tradition of the old Legion system of the Western army.  However, starting under Justinian, and coming full circle under Maurice, the army transforms into something different - the Byzantine army, which is very much more reliant on cavalry.  This will last throughout the period covered by this article, but will eventually give way to the feudal Thematic system (still cavalry dominant, but structured and supplied very differently).A nice overview and description of the army under Maurice (the Maurikian Byzantine Army) is provided on this DBA page - it talks about DBA army elements for this army, but also gives a nice short history about the various components.  Some very interesting fighting by the Byzantines, in this period, takes place in the Balkan peninsula, as well as else where, and against some of the other armies described in this article.  Other enemies for the Byzantines exist as well.Options for boardgame Wargamers might include a number of titles, such as Justinian from GMT or Byzantium from Martin Wallace. There are some other traditional wargames that touch on Byzantine warfare, but I'll mention them in a later article, as they cover later Byzantine history.  In addition to board wargames, there are even a number of other strategy games in this theme, that may or may not warrant the name \"wargame\".  Some examples might be Justinian from Mayfair (a Byzantine politics game) or Constantinopolis (Trade in Byzantium in the 7th century).That is my start for this topic, but I think I will develop some information about army lists, and tactics, and possible scenarios/campaigns for each of these separately.  Each of these three focus areas has lots of great personalities, will have strong links to the previous and the succeeding historical periods (and armies), and present loads of interesting wargaming possibilities.Note: Since writing this article, I started on a series of articles talking about wargaming the Barbarian Kingdoms.  Here they are, so far:OstrogothsVisigoths"},

But this is for a skirmish game.Condition: Painted and individually based.Notes:  These were acquired from someone who organized them for The Sword and the Flame, so twenty man units. There are regulars for both sides, as well as some irregular infantry (coureur de bois, and rangers) as well as some Indian unitsAmerican War for Independence Size:  Nice collection, probably around two thousand figures or so.

I have options and leaders to do early Pagan Saxons, and later Christian Anglo-Saxons.Condition: painted and ready to play. My only regret is my Saxon fyrd are mounted 3 to a stand.Notes: A nice large collection. Makes me wish I had later Imperial Romans (or Byzantines, or Post-Roman British), to use these guys as fifth and sixth century threats against the remainders of the Empire.  Still, plenty of foes in my collection.IrishSize: I have two distinct medieval Irish collections. One is a medium/large early Dark Ages focus, even including hound handlers and some chariots for those who believed the Irish still used them for leaders.  The other is later, but a smaller collection, and could be a foe for Normans in Ireland.Condition: Painted, based, ready to play.Notes: Personally, I like the Chariots. Also, stands with Druids, and some with Christian priests. WelshSize: Again, two sets. Dark ages Welsh in a sizable collection (enough for a large army), and later Welsh as 13th/14th century foes for England.Condition: Painted and ready to play. The later army, if it goes for a longbow heavy variant, has to borrow archers from my Hundred Years War English, but plenty to go around.Notes: Two nice foes for my other English based armies. I'd like to add some flavorful command stands with Dragon banners.Normans/FranksSize: plenty of figures and options for a large army. Condition: Painted, based, very playable.Notes: Cavalry have the distinctive Norman shield, as do some infantry. Plenty of other infantry to use in a Frankish option.VikingsSize: A vast collection of sea wolves. Easily enough for two large armies.Condition: Painted, based, bloodied in battle.Notes: Lots of options here, included mounted Viking infantry. I have some unpainted Long Ships, but I wish I had more.CarolingiansSize: A large collection,me ought for a big army, although cavalry has to be borrowed from other Early Medieval forces (such as the Norman army).Condition: Painted, based, and ready o play. I'd like to get and paint some actual continental cavalry from the 8th century. Notes: This makes a nice replacement for the Normans, to have a more balanced army against other early medieval infantry armies.  Can fight a Moslem army judicially selected from the units of my Crusades collection.CrusadesSize: Two large armies with many options, one is Christian and one is Moslem. Can definitely cover first and third crusades, as well as other battles of the same period.Condition:  Painted (beautifully) and based, ready to go. Notes: My largest regret here is that I don't have more Moslem figures, and that I don't have more theater specific terrain.Baron's WarsSize: Enough units to do two moderate/large armies.Condition: All painted, all based. Ready to go.Notes: These are \"generic\" medieval figures for battles in the 12th and 13th century. Some overlap with HYW collection. Could use some more lighter troops.SwissSize: A moderate sized army, if the keils are all halberd armed. Could be quite large if pike blocks are borrowed from my Renaissance Swiss.Condition:  All painted and ready to play. Some infantry could stand to be rebased.Notes: A solid foe for other medieval armies here, or could represent mercenary units.Hundred Years WarSize: Two very large armies, one French and one English. Condition: All painted, 90% based properly, ready for St Crispin's Day.Notes: There are some elements I would like to add, especially like lighter cavalry (sergeants, hobilars, jinetes) and maybe some more foot such as peasants/villeins and crossbow.  I probably have too many knights if such a thing is feasible.ScotsSize: A moderate sized collection of specifically Scottish units (schiltrons mostly, and some Scottish knights) but could be padded with other figures.  Easily could field a large army.Condition:  All painted, about half need rebasing.Notes: The long spear units look good, but need some organizing. Otherwise, another nice group to provide mercenaries/allies for other armies, or could be padded to stand on its own.PictsSize: Moderate size, but could easily be padded out with other similar Dark Ages figures.Condition: All painted, all based, ready to take on a variety of enemies.Notes: Another in my assortment of dark age armies, these are a precursor to the above Scottish army, from a few hundred years earlier. Not a lot to distinguish it from say the early Welsh or Irish - spearman, light horse, heavier infantry, slingers and archers.This series includesPart 1 - Ancients Part 2 - Medievals  (this article) Part 3 - RenaissancePart 4 - 18th CenturyPart 5 - NapoleonicsPart 6 - 19th Century"},

Some of my oldest figures. Split between dense infantry (4 figure bases) and loose density (3 figure bases) as well as equipment difference is chief split of Germans.  Need more specific German units to be painted.Carthaginians - Early and LateSize: Enough for a large army, either way.  Some allied figures, i.e. Spanish, could be the basis for their own army.Condition: Painted.  Need organization and basing.Notes: Could be a really nice multiplayer matchup v.

{"title": "Space Gaming - 2d vs 3d maps", "date": "Sunday, April 2, 2017", "text": "A discussion group on Facebook that talks about Traveller related items has been talking about 3d mapping vs 2d mapping.  I am a big fan of Classic Traveller (1977) and its derivative games.  Those include MegaTraveller, T4, T20, T5 and Mongoose Traveller.  One of the things about them, however, is that going back to the original, they render star maps in a 2d fashion, typically on a hex grid.  Let me say, that I am a big fan of the 2d representation, because it is not true (form a Physics sense) but it does represent a presentation of game/setting information in an intuitive and extremely useful format. What could be better?On a Traveller map, the first thing you will notice is hexagons, some with \"world systems\" marked in it.  Each hexagon represents a parsec (roughly 3.26 light years), and any parsec that has a solar system in it that is potentially of interest, has a marker on it showing such.  This is a nice reality on the space involved, for each hexagon might be home to several solar systems (if a denser region of the galaxy, this might be a higher number), or it might be void.  But regardless, only \"interesting\" systems are marked.  That means, systems that either might have a civilization/colony on them, or might represent the possibility for such.Regina Subsector - from the Traveller WikiBut the maps are in 2 dimensions.  Originally they were in simple black and white, and these days it is common to find them in color, with the various regions and system colors indicating some details.  But the maps are still on a 2d hex grid.  So on the example above, the planetary system Forboldn is 1 hexagon away from Knorbes, which means an approximate 1 parsec difference between them.  This is great for the game, because the interstellar capabilities of the ships are measured in the ability to 'jump' between points of normal space, that are limited in (because of the technology involved) distances of roughly 1 parsec.  So a jump-1 ship could travel from 1 hexagon to another (a vast distance) in the space of a week - but that makes this rendering of the starmap very useful for game navigation.But what about a 3d version of space - you know since space is basically a 3 dimensional construct, and all that...  Well, there have been some game maps that have done a good job on this.  I would like to talk about three, briefly, but in the light of a tabletop gaming constraint.  That constraint is that the map should be able to be printed out and passed around at the table, as an artifact to be consulted during game play.  A very nice 3d map on a computer that can be rotated, zoomed in and out of, is fabulous, but of more limited use during tabletop gaming.  In computer gaming, however- but that is a different story.  On to the examples I have.Space OperaIn the game Space Opera, the materials that were released by Fantasy Games Unlimited (the publisher of the game) were often placed on planets in their published Sectors.  These were regions of space, published as game setting modules, that featured a number of planetary systems in a cube of space.  The examples below are from The Mercantile League (which, if I recall, is Star Sector Atlas #2).The maps were published in their 8.5x11 Star Sector Atlas books, and the scale (which required the use of a ruler on the page to determine distances) was typically 1mm to 1 light year.  So you get out your ruler, determine that two worlds are 36mm apart from each other on the page, and you say \"They are 36 light years apart\".   Without having to use X and Y coordinates, and without having to do the Pythagorean Theorem calculation -- square root of ((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2).But, the 3d portion comes in with the fact that each world had a positive or negative measure (in light years, or LY) above or below the plane of the map.  So, taking the difference of these two gives you a second measure, the difference in the Z coordinate between the two points.  So now, with the X/Y measure in hand (the distance on the page), and the Z measure (calculated from +/- height differences) you can get the absolute 3d difference by again applying pythagoras as above.The game publications gave you, in each Star Sector Atlas, a basic travel distance table that listed the distances (and some game economic factors) for the pairings of the more interesting/important worlds within the sector, so the distances were already calculated.Finally, the last thing that was provided, in terms of a mapping assistant, for the FGU Space Opera Star Sector Atlas products, was the map showing the common space lanes (i.e. - the ones described in the \"Fares and Cargo Rates\" table).  This was simply the sector map with star lanes drawn on it.Pros/Cons of the FGU method - these are easy enough to understand, and having the Z coordinate on the map makes for an easy transition to 3d.  As always, with a 2d depiction of 3d space, the map can be illusionary in some instances, where there is a sharp Z difference between two points that are otherwise (X/Y) close on the map.  These maps are nice because there is no real grid (they would come, later, with an Index, matricing a number vs. a letter axis, to make finding planets a little easier), but the obverse of that coin is that you need a ruler graduated in millimeters (or would have to convert inches, each to 25.4 mm), in order to find distances that are not on the quick look up table.UniverseThe SPI effort to enter the roleplaying game market was with the game Universe.  Universe had three very nice things going for it.The character generation sequence had a great way to compare physical stats for characters from different geophysical planetary backgrounds (i.e. - difference in physical parameters based on the planetary environment you were born/raised in). The starship construction/combat rules were very nice (describing a setting with generally common ship hulls, perhaps as in the Niven Ringworld universe, but with different modular components), as you might expect from an experience board game publisher that had devised printed several sets of starship combat rules by the time the RPG arrived.  In this case it is the DeltaVee game.The 3d space map of the area roughly in a sphere of about +/- 25 light years around Earth.This article is interested in discussing the space map.  It worked, in concept, very similar to the map from FGU but with some important differences.  It incorporated iconography and color (as do the more modern Traveller maps) to indicate something about the stellar systems mapped.  In the case of Universe the colors correspond to the stellar sequence.  Different from the FGU Space Opera maps, it used a graph/grid to show the location of the worlds, so you did not need to use a ruler to find the difference of planets. But it did mean you had to apply Pythagoras.  One of the nicest things about the Universe map is the fact that it included the X,Y and Z coordinates for each system.  Also, Earth/Sol is at (0,0,0) so measure to other worlds from Earth is pretty easy to do.Finally, the third method of showing a 3d space on a 2d map is from the old Metagaming science fiction empire building game, Godsfire.  This game represented three dimensional space on a hex map.  The measurements for space were abstracted (slightly) and objects pressed on to a hex map, to make counting and measuring movement and disances between star systems to be quite easy (just count the hexes).  The Z component was brought in by making sure that each hexagon only represented the space at the plane of the map.Within the hexagon, there was a series of 11 spaces, 5 representing levels below the map, 1 representing the planar level of the map, and five representing levels above the map.  As this was a map for a multiplayer wargame, moving objects on the map was necessary, and could be accommodated by moving the object (ship, fleet, etc) by moving it \"up\" or \"down\" within a single hex, or from hex to hex (arriving at the same level in the new hex, as the level that you departed the old hex from.Pros/Cons - It is abstracted (as mentioned), and not as precise as the other methods, but it is certainly quick to navigate and move pieces around in.  Very simple and straightforward for campaigning and wargaming.As you can see from the image, each \"hexagon\" is actually represented as a square, but using offset rows, means each is spatially related to the six around it (essentially a hexagon).  And the spiral showing the levels (from +5 down to -5) within the hex.  Very convenient.This map was used by a group I played in years ago, as the campaign map for a Leviathan wargaming campaign.  It was an elegant way to do three dimensions, and it was very interesting to see players get surprised by a fleet that appeared similar, only to realize that it was at +4, and they were -3, adding (effectively) 7 more spaces of difference between the two fleets.So, there.  Three different methods of doing 3d mapping, on a 2d space, with different pros and cons for each.If interested in this topic, I can (not strongly enough) recommend Winchell Chung's page on 3-D Starmaps over at his Project Rho website.  Winch is a wargamer and artist and generally interested in the intersection between science and sci-fi and gaming, and his web pages are chock full of the most excellent information."},
{"title": "Chainmail Variant Rule - Post-Melee Results", "date": "Wednesday, March 29, 2017", "text": "Chainmail has many ways in which to recommend itself as a fast play set of big battle Medieval rules.  One of the more troubling areas, however, is in post-melee morale.To a modern eye, this is a set of mathematical calculations that will slow down the flow of the game.  It is actually all just simple math (addition and multiplication, for the most part), but it does seem to be out of favor with modern war game design philosophy.To that end, I offer the following system (but first, present the current system, for comparison).The Post-Melee Morale system, as is On page 15 of the rule book, there is a procedure for calculating Post-Melee Morale.  It involves three factors, added together:A factor for the side that took fewer casualties in the melee.  This is the difference between the two casualty counts, times a d6 roll.  Only the side that took fewer casualties gets this factor.A factor based on the current size of the unit, as number of total figures times their Morale Rating.  Both sides get this factor.A factor based on who has more figures surviving after the melee.  This difference between the two totals of surviving figures, and is multiplied by a d6 roll.  Only the side with more figures gets this factor.Add up the factors.  Each side will have at least one of these (number 2), but only one side or the other will benefit from the others (numbers 1 and 3).Compare the two totals, and then consult the difference on this table:DifferenceResult0-19 differencemelee continues20-39 differencelower total side moves back 1/2 move, but in good order40-59 differencelower total side moves back 1 move, but in good order60-79 differencelower side retreats 1 move80-99 differencelower side routs 1 1/2 move100+ differencelower side surrenders, and victorious side may continue a charge if possible, leaving behind 1 guard per 5 prisonersFactor number 2 above, is the current total value of each unit - meaning the total number of remaining figures, multiplied by the Morale Rating of the figures.  In a mixed unit, each figure is multiplied by it's own Morale Rating, and then the subunits are added together.  Here are the Morale Ratings:TroopTypeMoraleRatingPeasants3Light Foot and Levies4Heavy Foot5Elite Heavy Foot6Light Horse6Armored Foot, Janissary7Medium Horse, Landsknechte8Heavy Horse, Swiss Pikemen9The New Post-Melee Morale System, ProposedFirst, the concept - This method involves taking a morale test.  Both sides calculate what their target number would be, and the lower total tests first (2d6, trying to roll the target number or less).  If the first test fails, then depending on the nature of the fail, it will consult the Post-Melee Morale Test Results table below.  If the first test passes, then the second unit will make a test against it's target number.  If the second unit fails, then it will also suffer the results from the table below.  If it passes, then both units are still engaged in combat, and the melee continues next turn.Method -Each side determines their target number.  This is based on the Morale Rating from the above table.  To that number, add/subtract the following:+1, if larger than the enemy+1, if took fewer casualties than the enemy-2, if 1/4 of the original unit is dead-4, if 1/3 of the original unit is dead-6, if 1/2 of the original unit is dead, or moreEach side will calculate this target number.The side with the lower target number tests first.If the first testing unit fails, then it consults the results table below.If the first testing unit passes, then the other side will test.If the second unit has to test, and it fails, consult the results table below.If the second unit has to test, and it passes, then that means both sides have passed, and the melee continues.In practice, this amounts to a quick comparison of target numbers, and the lower number tests.  If it fails, that is the end.  If it passes, then the other side tests.  That's all.If the two target numbers are tied - both sides roll.  Either side that fails will suffers the results.  If (extremely rarely) both sides try to surrender, then both sides rout instead.Post-Melee Morale Test ResultsTestResultsPassContinueMiss -1back 1/2 move, good orderMiss -2back 1 move, good orderMiss -3retreat 1 moveMiss -4rout 1 1/2 moveMiss -5 or moresurrenderMiss -1, etc, means the 2d6 dice roll missed the target number by 1 (i.e. target=7, and 8 is rolled on the dice).Here is the whole process reduced to a flow chart, and with the Morale Rating, and Test Results charts included (click to make bigger/more readable).Multiple UnitsIn order to apply this method to multiple units, calculate the Target Number for all units involved on all sides.Starting with the lowest value unit, begin testing.  Apply results to each unit, as it tests.If any units have the same Target Number, always test them simultaneously.  Apply the \"Took Less Casualties\" modifier to each unit on the side that took fewer overall.  Apply the \"Larger than the Enemy\" modifier to the side that has more total figures (counting all units involved), to each unit on that side.  Apply the modifiers for unit loss to each unit individually.Stop testing when only units from one side or the other remain in contact.If a unit is to Surrender, but the final results have a friendly unit still in contact, then that unit Routs instead. Example - A heavy foot unit (12 figures), and a medium horse unit (9 figures) hit a large armored foot unit (24 figures).  In the melee, the heavy foot unit loses 4 figures.  The medium horse unit loses 2 figures.  The armored foot unit loses 5 figures.  Start by calculating Target Numbers:Heavy Foot - base value of 5Medium Horse - base value of 8Armored Foot - base value of 7After the Melee, the Armored Foot unit is larger (19 remaining, vs a total of 15 remaining on the other side).  The Armored Foot also took fewer casualties than the other side (5 figures killed, vs 6 figures killed).  So the Armored Foot unit gains a +1 for Fewer Casualties, and a +1 for larger than the enemy.  The Heavy Foot have lost 1/3 of their figures, so take a -4.  That makes the Heavy Foot unit have a target of 1, the Medium Horse unit still has a target of 8, and the Armored Foot unit has a target of 9.  Rolling, in order, for the Heavy Foot (roll of a 6, which means that they will surrender to the Armored Foot).  The Medium Horse is next, and must test (even though the Heavy Foot failed) because there are still units in contact from both sides.  The Medium Horse rolls a 7, and remains in contact.  The Armored Foot rolls a 6, and also remains in contact.  The melee will continue next turn between the Medium Horse (with 7 figures remaining) and the Armored Foot (with 19 figures remaining).Because the Heavy Foot still had a friendly unit in contact after all tests, rather than surrender, they rout instead.ThoughtsIn practice, trying this out with just nominal units fighting it out using pencil and paper, this works fine.  It rewards the better quality unit (very medieval), but also modifies that by the realities of the melee.This method seems to work, it only has to be put into practice in a few solo games.  If anyone reading this tries it out, please let me know your results."},
{"title": "Dice Spreads, Probability Curves, and Rules Writing", "date": "Friday, March 24, 2017", "text": "In advance of an upcoming article I am planning to write, where I review the Knights and Magick rules (by Arnold Hendrick, and published by Heritage back in 1980), I wanted to address a rather interesting dice mechanism that are employed in the rules.That is the 1-15 dice roll.  This is accomplished by rolling two dice, and adding them together.  The first dice is a rather common d6, and the second dice is the typical d10, but numbered from 0-9 (the 0 face on the die is valued at zero, and not at ten).  Adding the two results together yields a number from 1 to 15.Now, the asymmetry of the roll always bothered me.  How could you possible hope to have game feng shui when you are rolling two different dice, and adding them together?  It was preposterous!  Sort of like the damage rolls from early Runequest and Call of Cthulhu and other games, where you might have 1d8 for the weapon, plus 1d4 for your strength, and maybe +1 for a good quality blade - so your damage looked like 1d8 + 1d4 + 1.  Weird, but okay for roleplaying games.  Wargames were supposed to be above all that sort of thing.  Better.  More pure.But here we were, with Mr. Hendrick's rules using a D6 and a D10 added together.Let's look at the results.  To compare it, a brief examination of the (much more common) 2d6 bell curve.  Here we see a smooth progression from one result (for a Two), up to six results for a Seven.  And then back down again to one result for a Twelve.  There are a total of 36 possible dice pairings, so the frequency is a number of times out of 36.  This is pretty standard stuff, that is part of any study of probability, but also should be pretty intuitive to just about any long time gamer, and/or game designer.ResultFrequency21/3632/3643/3654/3665/3676/3685/3694/36103/36112/36121/36But now lets take a look at the rather interesting D15 result.  Here we have 60 possible results, rather than 36.  There are more possible results (1-15, rather than 2-12).  Plotting the possible results we see:ResultFrequency11/6022/6033/6044/6055/6066/6076/6086/6096/60106/60115/60124/60133/60142/60151/60Okay, so what do we see from this?  First, the numbers of all the middle results, from 6-10, have the same frequency - 6, our of 60 results, or a 10% chance of getting any of those numbers.How does this behave in the game?  Well, we end up with many more middling values (half the possible results are from 6-10).  Plus, in a game that deals in + and - factors added to the dice, for a variety of different causes, this will tend to balance out and level the impact of the dice modifiers.  What I mean by that, is that in a 2d6 dice roll, a single +1 or -1 can have a very high percentage impact on the dice chance, especially if your base number is off the middle.  In this case, the middle (or stable region) is spread out, so that dice modifiers are more predictable in their impact (a minor change with a +1 or -1).  This also means that having additional plus or minus factors won't be an overwhelming impact, as it is in a 2d6 curve.Once I pulled out the results, and looked at them, the asymmetry doesn't bother me AS MUCH, but it is still there.  I think I would prefer a 3d6 roll, or 5d4 roll, to balance out that middle and level it - but that is a different story.Now, with the recently reviewed Hackbutt & Pike rules (written by Ben King, in the Tac-50 rules series), we see that the casualty table is driven by a dice difference.  Again, looking at the 2d6 probability table, but selecting results based on the difference between the two numbers (agreeing that doubles results have to be rerolled), we have the following:Die DifferenceFrequency110/3628/3636/3644/3652/36Of course, the total frequency of pairs with a difference only adds up to 30 out of 36, again because we tossed out the possible results where doubles are rolled on the dice (6 chances out of 36).This is a very flat progression.  It is also interesting that on the Tac-50 tables, the least valued result is always a difference of 5, followed (in order) by 1,2,3,4.  A very interesting use of an interesting probability spread.One more thing - I have a plan to (very soon) write a review of the original Sword and the Flame rules.  In those rules, as in many others before and since, combat is resolved between two miniatures by rolling a dice on each side, and the high scorer wins the fight.  With no modifiers, and with Tie results not counting, there are 15/36 chances for each side to win, if using six sided dice.Side A wins - 15/36Side B wins - 15/36Neither Side (tie) - 6/36But what happens when we change this by just a little bit?  Say, as in The Sword and the Flame, one side or the other gains a +1.  In this case, what if Side A gains a plus 1?  Very different results.Side A wins - 21/36Side B wins - 10/36Neither Side (tie) - 5/36Looking at the results it shifts, from even chances, to a Two-One chance of winning - from just granting a +1 on the dice.With a +2 on the dice, it is even more extreme.  In fact, looking that the following table, we see it is 5-1 in favor of the side with a +2 on the dice.Side A wins  - 26/36Side B wins - 6/36Neither Side (tie) - 4/36Now, lets stretch this even further, and take a look at what happens, with no bonuses, but with one side winning Ties...  Again, lets assume that Side A has the advantage, and with no dice modifiers, will win ties.Side A wins - 21/36Side B wins - 15/36Neither Side (tie) - No TiesFrom these results, the odds change slightly, from even chances, to 4-3 chances for the side with the advantage.  Not as extreme as a +1, but then again, conceptually, saying that one side or the other wins ties is like saying they got a +1/2.What we see is that in the case of an opposed dice roll (found in games going back to Featherstone and Grant, of course, but still present in modern sets) getting a +1 or even the benefit of winning ties is a very large bonus.This idea of opposed dice rolls is common in many rulesets.  But in some others, there is the possibility of a player rolling several dice (typically more dice, for higher skilled combatants, for instance), and then selecting the highest dice, before comparing it to the opposition.  In this case, for instance, there is a much greater chance for a soldier who rolls 3d6 and selects the highest, to have a great number than his opponent, who is only rolling 2d6 to select the highest.  The component of a good number is still present, as a singleton dice can always come up as a 6, and the highest opposition roll could be any value less.  But what is the probability?Lets construct a table, where we record the odds (and percentage chance) of getting a number, between 1 and 6, if it is the highest (or tied for the highest) out of a pool of dice.  To keep this simple, and illustrative, I am going to do it for three pools of dice - a single D6, 2d6, and 3d6.  Notice the shift in probability...HighestResult1d6 Prob.2d6 Prob.3d6 Prob.11/6 (17%)1/36 (3%)1/216 (.5%)21/6 (17%)3/36 (8%)7/216 (3%)31/6 (17%)5/36 (14%)19/216 (9%)41/6 (17%)7/36 (19%)37/216 (17%)51/6 (17%)9/36 (25%)61/216 (28%)61/6 (17%)11/36 (31%)91/216 (42%)Again, there is a dramatic shift in probability, just by changing the dice rolling mechanism slightly.  By rolling 2d6, and selecting the highest number, your chance of having a 2 is halved, and your chance of having only a 1 is dropped to approximately 3% chance.So the chances of rolling a higher number, when you can pick from a pool, are better.  That is intuitive, but looking at the table for 3d6, we see over a 40% chance that your number will be a 6.   And if you need AT LEAST a 5 (which means that the results for a 5 or a 6 will satisfy) your chance increases to 60% (42+28), and so on.At this point, I will abandon the exercise.  It might be nice, to compare the chances of a player rolling a pool of 2d6 to beat a player rolling a pool of 3d6, but I think I would rather return to writing reviews.  And maybe lunch."},
{"title": "Hackbutt & Pike - review", "date": "Thursday, March 23, 2017", "text": "This is another review in the Once and Future Rules series, of wargame rules that are out of print, but that got a lot of play at one time (at least, in the clubs and groups I played in since the early 1980s).This review is of Hackbutt & Pike, the Tac-50 series rules for Renaissance wargaming.  These were printed in 1977, but copies are still available through Cotton Jim Flags (write and ask - I think they are $5, which is a great price for a rulebook these days, and they still read well).The period of the renaissance has remained (through most of my adult life) one of my favorite periods of history for both study, and for wargaming.  As you can tell, if you have been following this series of reviews from the beginning, I have dabbled with or played a number of different rulesets for the period. The Universal SoldierForlorn Hope Dominance Cavaliers and Roundheads Tercio And I am at least planning to do the Protz ECW rules, and the Gush Renaissance rules in the series. Chesapeake Military Society - a Reminiscence Along side all those other Renaissance rules, why am I reviewing Hackbutt & Pike?  Simply for two reasons.  First, they are rules that I played in the 80s and 90s (which fits the criteria of this series of articles).  Second, they are part of a series of rule sets that helped to define my earliest exposure to a wargaming club.In the early 1980s, while in High School, and shortly after I began driving, I discovered (through an advertisement at a local bookstore in a mall - remember mall book stores?) that there was a local wargaming club that met in Hampton, Virginia at the local National Guard Armory.  That club was the Chesapeake Military Society (CMS).  Prior to my exposure to the club they previously met at one of the old batteries at Fort Monroe.  By the time I encountered them, they were meeting once a month at the Armory.  Now, the National Guard Armory, in Hampton, consisted of a large muster area for the Guard meetings, plus a large building that included a basketball sized gymnasium. This is where the gaming club met.  As a testament to the gross popularity of tabletop gaming at the time, they would fill up the place.  There would be all sorts of miniatures games going on, and when I first went, there were also some role playing games.  There was a terrific WW2 naval battle (using Seapower III I think), with 1:1200 ships, on the floor of the gymnasium (the old school - with long surveyor's tapes run out to lengths of 20+ feet between ships for salvos, etc).  And there was a large Napoleonic game, in lovely 25mm, being played on a large table.This Napoleonics game being played (and refereed) by the core members of the club, although there were many other games going on.  The rules for the game were Valeur et Discipline, written by the luminary behind the club - Mr. Ben King.  Ben had several other rules that the club used, and in this particular series (which is called Tac-50 - as they are all based on a 1:50 scale) there are four sets proper - Mitre, Mustache & Musket for Seven Years War (and mid 18th century), Valeur et Discipline for Napoleonics, Kepi & Pickelhaub for mid 19th century, and Hackbutt & Pike for Renaissance.  Another set, for Vauban era siege warfare and early 18th century field battles exists called Fusil & Fortress, but it is on another scale of detail from the rest of the series, and covers so much more than the rest.  I plan to review several (or perhaps all) of these in this series.Shortly after this time, the peninsula location of Campaign Headquarters (the original was in Norfolk, Virginia) would open, and CMS would change to have their monthly meetings at the store.  It was at these meetings that I became familiar with the Tac-50 rules.  Usually, but not always, refereed by Ben, the rules are very clear, and are also quite \"bloody\" - leading to a high casualty rate, for quick play games.Hackbutt & Pike is not the set of Tac-50 rules that I played the most often (that is probably Valeur et Discipline), but it is the set that I refereed several times, and the set I played most often outside of the CMS club meeting settings.  And it is one of my favorite periods, as mentioned earlier.  The ruleset does not lay down a specific time period (probably for the best), but could easily stretch back to the 14th century (as the introduction to the history section begins there), which includes the later Medieval period, and could run up to the middle of the 17th century - the Monmouth Rebellion or War of the Grand Alliance might be possible, but would be a stretch.Battle of Rocroi, by Augusto Ferrer-DalmauIntroduction The rules come in a nice 8.5x11 booklet, running to 44 pages in length.  They are divided up into eight sections:Game StructureTerrain & WeatherHistory, Tactics & OrganizationMovementMeleeFirepowerCasualtiesControl, Reaction & MoraleThey follow up with a nice bibliography.  This ruleset's bibliography first introduced me to Charles Oman's Art of War in the Sixteenth Century, so for that alone I am forever indebted.The Game Structure is basically an overview of scale (1 model soldier represents 50 men), and how to base figures for the game.  Time scale is given, also - turns are 25-30 minutes, and ground is 1\" to 25 yards.  This is followed by some basic game concepts - you should write general orders for your army, and also fire priority for all your missile troops.  There should be a command figure representing your general on the tabletop, and each turn, both armies should write tactical orders detailing things like charges, changes in move, etc.  If a player wishes to change the overall battle orders for a unit, they must be carried from the general to the unit by a courier figure (the general has two such figures at the start of the game), which may be captured or killed in the process.Swiss Mercenaries crossing the Alps, by Luzerner SchillingOne word right up front.  I have remarked in this series of reviews over and over again how I don't care for simultaneous move rules (which Tac-50 sets all are), and how I dislike writing orders.  However . . . every rule has it's exception.  Some of the Tac-50 games I played were extremely enjoyable, and with a knowledgeable and active referee it can work.  Arguments can still arise, but if the referee is respected by all the players, it works out well.  Forward.The next section covers terrain and weather this has several sections in it.Roads - how to depict them, and what they mean for movementGround condition - roll 3d6; 3-7 bad ground; 8-18 good ground.  Optional of course.Weather - what it is, and how it changes.Forests - dense and lightHills - 10 yard contours, and how they affect movement and visibilityObstacles, Barriers, and Field Works - how to pass them, how to lay them, and war wagons (Hussites?)Rivers and Streams - how to depict them, how to ford themBridges and BoatsHousesThis is followed up by a nice, but sadly too concise, section (running about 6 pages) on the history, tactics, and composition of some major armies of the Renaissance period. Following this, which includes some nice diagrams showing some of the major battalia formations of the period (such as the Spanish Tercio, or the Swiss Keil), we then move on to section 4, which begins the meat of the rules.Turn Order and MovementSection 4 is called Movement, and begins with a short overview of the turn structure.  The turn is intended to be simultaneously executed, with both sides moving, and then fighting and shooting all taking place simultaneously.  This works well if you have an organized and knowledgeable referee guiding things.The turn sequence, as presented here, is this:(Implied) - Write OrdersSkirmishers may fire weaponsMovement of TroopsFire of weapons by Formed Troops (and artillery)Hand to Hand Combat As mentioned, skirmishers may fire before all moves.  Or, they may do a split move and fire.  If, while doing this, they come into range of enemy troops, they may still be fired on by those troops in the proper turn sequence.Other actions other than regular moves are covered, as a function of how many they can perform in a turn (or how many turns they will take).  This includes such things as infantry moving backwards, crossing obstacles, entering a building, passage of lines, or forming a wagon lager.The movement chart gives moves for formed units and skirmishers.  For cavalry it also lists Caracole movement (moving up, discharging pistols, and return).Artillery and Wagons are given movement rates for draught animals (being pulled along), or being manhandled. Hand-to-Hand FightingThe next section of the rules covers hand-to-hand fighting, or melee combat.  Although this period, in history, and as described in the history section of the rulebook, is a period when disciplined soldiery began to replace the heavy knight on the battlefield.  However, the heavy knight is still a superior weapon, even if it cannot win battles on its own any longer.  And, much of the replacement of the knight is in the form of pikemen and other polearm supplied troops (although this would give way, and evolve into, the bayonet).While there is currently a debate about the use of the pike (see my earlier article Push of Pike), in wargaming the possibility exists that they may be exercised effectively - so rules have to exist.  And with these two arms of the renaissance battlefield (the horse, and the pike) being focused on hand-to-hand fighting, it is fitting that this is a major focus of the rules.A side note - although above I make that case that hand-to-hand fighting is a major feature of renaissance warfare, and thus the Hackbutt & Pike rules, it is true that close combat is a major feature (a battle winning feature) of all the Tac-50 rules.  This is appropriate, because it is what wargamers seek to engage in.  And whether the encounter reflects the actual casualties that occur from bayonets and pikes piercing the enemy soldiery, or if those casualties reflect a fleeing soldiery that lost their nerve in the face of such weapons, it matters little - it is a part of combat in these periods, and something wargamers regularly rely on to win battles.In these rules, the key to Hand-to-Hand fighting is the point value of the soldiers involved.  Light Infantry figures are worth 1 point each, up to Heavy Cavalry (Knights) are worth 4 points each.  The basic procedure is to total up the number of points you have fighting, more on how that is calculated is described below, then find that row on the casualty table, roll some dice, and you get a number of points inflicted (by consulting the proper column on the table).  Divide this number of points by the point value of the target unit, and you get the number of figures killed.The Casualty TableHow many figures will fight?  This is found by consulting a table called the Melee Matrix.  There, you will cross reference two different letters - each reflecting the weapon system of one of the two units involved (attacker on the left, defender across the top), and the result will give which column to roll on, on the casualty table, and will also tell you how many ranks of figures get to fight.  From there, take a look at the point of contact - all figures on the front rank in contact, and all those to their flanks within 2\" (about 1 multi figure stand) on either side of the contact, will get to fight.  Plus a similar number of additional ranks, if additional ranks get to fight.Melee Matrix, and Point Values of FiguresDifference of Dice is printed boldly across the top of the Casualty Table.  This is how the exact number of points is determined.  The players will roll 2d6, and determine the difference between them.  So if a play rolls a 6 and a 3, the difference is 3.  Doesn't matter which dice is first or second, it is only the difference that matters.  Doubles must be re-rolled.  In this way, a weighted series of results is determined (take a look at a simple 6x6 matrix, with the odds of each difference counted up to see what I am talking about), and a curve is introduced into the casualty table, while still preserving only 5 columns of numbers.Which column on the Casualty Table to use?The basic system is similar to a few other rule sets (point values goes back to Charles Grant, I believe), but of those reviewed in this blog, it is very similar to Forlorn Hope, the biggest difference being that the results in Hackbutt & Pike are in points, rather than in whole figures.As mentioned, one of the lacking elements of the (otherwise excellent) quick reference sheet provided with the game (the book comes with two copies), is the table of letters defining a unit's fighting style.  Here is the table (note that there are two entries for 'E'): A - Dry PikesB - Supported Pikes (with swordsmen, dopplesoldners, polearms, etc)C - Short Hafted Pole Arms (halberd, glaives, etc)D - Targeteers - Sword and Targe (or Buckler) armedE - Disciplined Soldiers with Misc Weapons (sword, axe, spear, etc)E - All troops that are in Open Order (this is usually missile armed troops)F - Infantry in Skirmish FormationG - Dismounted Warriors - trained, but undisciplined, such as foot knights or most Turkish infantryH - Cavalry in Close OrderI - Cavalry in Skirmish Order (horse archers, etc)Example: A unit of 18 'dry' Medium Infantry Pikemen (3 stands across, in two ranks, 1.5 points each) are facing a unit of 24 Sword & Buckler Light Infantry men (4 stands across, in two ranks, 1 point each).  Consulting the weapon system table in the book (frustatingly, this is the one table that is not on the quick reference sheet, but the letter of each unit could be recorded on an order of battle sheet), we find that 'dry' Pikemen (so called because they are not supported by zweihanders, polearms, or other supporting infantry) are the letter 'A'.  Also consulting, we find out that the Sword & Buckler men are the letter 'D'.   Comparing this, we find that an A unit vs a D unit (on the Melee Matrix) rolls on Column I, and uses 1 rank of troops.  Similarly, the D unit vs the A unit rolls on Column III, and uses 1 rank of troops.  Both units will use their whole front rank (9 figures for the Pikemen, and 12 figures for the Swordsmen).  Checking for the pikes first, we find 9 figures times 1.5 points is 13.5, or rounded up, 14 points on the casualty table.  The dice are rolled, a 4 and a 2, or difference of 2 in column I.  This means '2' points have been inflicted, which means 2 whole Swordsmen have been killed.  Returning the favor, 12 swordsmen, at 1 point each, is the 12 roll on the table.  Consulting column III, with a dice difference of 3 (a 4 and 1 were rolled), we see that 9 points were inflicted, which means (at 1.5 points each) 6 pikemen were killed.Not mentioned in the above example, which serves to illustrate the use of the melee matrix and the casualty table, but there is a list of possible dice modifiers.  Compared to many rulesets this list is blessedly short, as can be seen here. Now for the exciting part.  Combat is fought in (potentially) up to 6 rounds.  First, assuming that both units pass morale tests, they enter combat, and fight three rounds.  Then some mid-combat tests are further performed, and if both pass, they fight another three rounds.  The second three rounds assume that there is now a general melee and discipline is flown out the window, so all the niceties of the melee matrix is ignored, and all combat is only in column I.  What can stop this slaughter?  Well, if a unit has taken results that meet their Maximum Allowed Loss (M.A.L.), then it can trigger an end to the hostilities, or if the morale tests dictate so (see morale below).  Usually, three rounds are fought, and that is decisive.  Those three rounds are fought in rapid succession, not over three turns, by the way.  So when a unit hits another, there are (possibly) three or six casualty rolls for each side.  It is bloody, but is is also dramatic, as you see how one unit starts to fail and eventually is swamped.  Stubborn units get to go all in for six rounds of fighting - massive carnage!The close combat section ends with rules on how to fight encounters between leaders (say, with a personal duel).  Also, once a combat is over and one side or the other retires, it is important to determine if either side captured a standard.  This can have an impact on morale tests, and provides for great bragging rights. It is based on a reaction test (see below).Ranged Combat The whole series of Tac-50 rules, if taken chronologically (and including the 18th century set Fusil & Fortress), is a series of wargaming rules charting the evolution of firepower from the late medieval period (the eponymous hackbutt of the set being reviewed here), up through the height of the age of rifles (the end of the 19th century, as portrayed in Kepi & Pickelhaub).This period we see not only the muscle powered weapons of antiquity and the medieval period (spears, slings, bows, etc.) but also the introduction of gunpowder weapons.  This includes the hackbutt (or arquebus), the musket, the pistol and of course gunpowder based artillery. A weapons table details the range of the firepower based weapons, and also which column to use on the casualty table.  It also includes such useful information as to what the effect is if the target is wearing no armor (the default case is that the target figures are wearing some armor), and also what happens if they are fully (plate) armored.  There is also a detail about which factor row to consult when firing artillery.Not every weapon can fire every turn, and the loading table details how much of a turn's worth of movement must be sacrificed to reload the weapon.  In practice, we found that marking a unit with gunpowder blasts (i.e. - cotton balls) is effective to show they are unloaded.As was clear from the die modifier table, most of the modifiers in the game for combat have an affect on missile fire.Unlike close combat, there is only one round of missile fire per turn.CasualtiesThis section of the rules details (as described above) how to use the casualty table, and how to get a dice difference. It also points out that the vagaries of the point system mean that sometimes a unit can never inflict enough points to kill a single enemy figure.  In those cases, it suggests that the total number of attacking factors/figures be multiplied by 2 or even 3 to get a reasonable result - but this must be done equally for both sides in a melee or firefight.Since the rules (especially the close combat rules) are so very bloody, there is also a section here that allows you to detail, after a combat, exactly how many of those \"casualty\" figures are actually casualties, and how many return to your ranks, ready to march again immediately.  In this way, even though tabletop battles are quite bloody, forces remain relatively intact for the purpose of playing campaigns.Reactions and MoraleUnits are rated, according to their training and dedication, as one of five different classes.Class I - Untrained, Undisciplined -  peasants, feudal levy, untrained burghersClass II - Semi-Trained - town militiaClass III - Trained - fighting for a cause, such as Royal body guards, noble's retinueClass IV - Trained - mercenaries or national troopsClass V - Arrogant - Swiss, Knights, FanaticsUsing this class, a unit will have to occasionally make a reaction test (reasons are listed below), and will result in one of four reaction results - 0, A, B, or C.0 - Leadership has lost control, Unit takes matter into their own hands, Advance at nearest enemyA - Unit will continue to follow ordersB - Unit will retire from the battle, but in good order, and will defend itselfC - Unit has given up hope and will throw down weapons and fleeThe reasons for making tests are as follows:When enemy first comes into view.Prior to melee (on contact)After each three rounds of meleeAfter leader of army is killed or capturedAfter M.A.L. (Maximum Allowed Loss) is reachedAfter all unit leaders are killed (rules detail if one of three leader figures are killed in combat) A unit rolls 2d6, and applies modifiers (such as based on MAL, or situational modifiers) and then consults a chart based on their class. This gives one of the four results (0,A,B,C).The reaction section also details such events as asking for quarter, units that are NOT granted quarter can roll for desperation (determine bonuses to morale for fighting on); looting; the chance of capturing a standard based on morale results from melee combat; and others.Review/OpinionI like the Tac-50 sets of rules, but they are somewhat dated these days.  One of the things I will still decry, in spite of having numerous successful (and memorable) games with these rules, is the simultaneous nature of the turn sequence.They are fast - the method for rolling multiple close combat rounds in a single turn will see to that.  But these are (approximately) 30 minute turns, so each combat round represents 5 minutes (more or less) of hard fighting.  That isn't exactly so, because the turn can also include movement, but it does represent a possibly large amount of fighting.  Still, the casualties generated are extreme and obscene - but they work very well.  The game is very playable, and very fast.  I have played in games with hundreds of stands of figures on each side, to a complete result within 3 hours or so of playtime.These work great, in my opinion, for the Italian Wars, and other wars of religion.  As well as the later medieval battles (These would be great for Hundred Years War as well as Wars of the Roses games).  They are intended to cover English Civil War and Thirty Years War, and do so pretty well, but the rules for mixed battalions of pike and shot are not included.  Each body is its own \"unit\" for the purpose of the game.  Equally, there is not a chance (that I recall) to evade, so a shot unit cannot, for instance, run for cover under the pikes.  Most of the other Renaissance rules I have reviewed in this series of articles do such representation with either maneuver, combat, or morale rules (or a combination of all three).Cavalry is dealt with exceptionally well here, and the simple rules for pistols, caracoling, and so forth give the different tactical systems of the time good coverage.These may be something of a challenge for me, in a future article and perhaps some solo gaming, to come up with a You-Go-I-Go variant of the game.  Perhaps allowing for reaction moves?  Not sure, but it could work.  The rules are too good to keep that bugaboo of simultaneous turns in the way of playing them."},
{"title": "Angriff! - review", "date": "Thursday, March 9, 2017", "text": "This is another review in the Once and Future Rules series, of wargame rules that are out of print, but that got a lot of play at one time (at least, in the clubs and groups I played in since the early 1980s).This is a review of the Angriff rules, by Myers and Zimmermann, from 1968.  The version I have, and am reviewing (in particular) is the version I played just after high school, from the 1982 printed version.  While I only played these, by themselves, a little in the 1980s, I liked them, and would continue to use the infantry rules with other sets of tank rules, for a very long time.  Before I get into the detailed review, a little history and nostalgia about my history with WW2 rules and wargaming. World War 2 wargaming, has been a very large part of my wargaming experience from the beginning.  Before coming to miniatures and miniature wargaming, I started with board games that had a WW2 flavor, and also I had been an avid military model builder, mostly of US ground vehicles from WW2.  Moving into miniatures, my first foray was into Napoleonics, as described earlier in another review, and that gave way to medieval skirmish gaming very quickly (as something my co-gamers at the time were interested in).However, my brothers and I, like lots of kids from that generation, also grew up on a steady diet of WW2 war movies and books.  So when the possibility of building some WW2 miniatures, and coming up with rules, came upon us, we used the plastic HO (including all the near-HO scales, 1:87, 1:76, and 1:72) models for infantry from Airfix and Atlantic, as well as all the many HO scale models we had built and painted.  The rules were based on my experience, at the time, with the Hinchliffe guide, as well as some books from the library on wargaming.  It seemed to me that these types of games, unlike the \"obviously\" much more scientific SPI and Avalon Hill games, could be written by an amateur.  So I came up with some rules.  They were simple.  Tanks moved 8\".  Jeeps moved 12\".  Infantry moved 4\".  Shooting was by numbers of D6, and the number of 6s rolled were casualties.  A US Sgt with a SMG was by far the most dangerous element in the game (thanks John Wayne movies).Moving forward, I got a little more interested in more formal rules.  I got a copy of Tractics, from TSR.  I really liked the first book - Tank and AntiTank, but it was just a little bit too much detail.  That remains true today for lots of people who encounter Tractics.Moving forward, I tried some other rules sets, eventually (later on) setting on Overwatch, but in the meantime, I tried the Angriff rules and also the WRG 1925-1950 rules.  One thing I encountered early on was the fantastic magazine, Wargamer's Digest, from Gene McCoy.The pictures of battles, and the fantastic tabletop scenarios and maps, along with Gene's system 76 order of battle system were extremely exciting, and one of the things that drove my interest in this period.  So when I got into Angriff, and saw the possibility of representing troops in a way similar to Gene's - with a single tank for a command vehicle, and then a tank representing each platoon, so a company might have a total of four models.  That works great for Angriff, and was the scale of gaming I wanted to do.  I never used a total of 30 miniatures on a stand to represent the infantry, as Angriff requests, but usually I would have a stand of three miniatures to represent a platoon or section. The rulebook itself is divided up into (roughly) two sections.  The first, up to page 24, is the actual wargames rules.  This covers a variety of different topics:Unit organizationPreparing for BattleMovement of ForcesSightingTerrain DescriptionsArtillery FireTank FireSmall Arms FireThe MeleeThe ChargePercentage and Direct Fire TablesEngineersUrban WarfareMorale FactorsOdds-n-EndsThe second section is the set of detailed appendices.  This runs from page 25, through to the end of the book, at page 62.  This is an excellent set of charts covering not only the modeling of combat phenomena in the wargame rules (such as vehicle parameters, and weapon systems range and accuracy), but also things like typical order of battle charts for common organizations from WW2.  As a very useful resource from the time, there is also a list of manufacturers that make HO and Micro scale WW2 models.ScaleSo, as mentioned, the rules call for a 1-to-1 representation on tabletop by vehicle models, but using stands for infantry is recommended (a stand for 10 men is perfect).  However . . . as mentioned, most of the time when I played these rules, we used 1 vehicle for a platoon, when translating a historical OB or one of Gene McCoy's excellent scenarios.  That gets a little funky sometimes, but seems to work for most scenarios.Ground scale is 50 yards to an inch.  (I can't find it now that I am looking, but I recall that in micro scale it is 100 yards to an inch).Turns appear to be about a minute per turn (calculating backwards from the movement rates).Turn SequenceAngriff has each player roll 2d6, to determine initiative.  High roller gets to chose to be player A or player B in the following sequence.  Note, as you read through this, that phases 1 and 2, as well as phases 6 and 7 are each roughly simultaneous.  So, while player A does phase 1, then player B does phase 2, the results of those are simultaneous.  Everything else, happens when it happens.Side A moves 1/3 of its move, plus an additional 3\" for all vehicles or men on roads.Side B moves 1/3 of its move, plus an additional 3\" for all vehicles or men on roads.Artillery fire, if any, commences.Tanks or vehicle mounted weapons fire.Small arms fire, if any, commences.Side B moves the remaining 2/3 of its move (but only 1/3 if it has fired).Side A moves the remaining 2/3 of its move (but only 1/3 if it has fired). Melee combats.No movement plotting, no order writing.  The importance of moving first or second, in turn phases 1/2 and 6/7 is of course the psychology of giving away your intended position before your opponent moves, so it may be useful to move second (i.e. choose being Player B if you are high roller for initiative).  Equally, being player A could be important, it is up to the player.MovementAs can be expected from the turn sequence, all movement distances (given in the rules by vehicle type; or a total of 6\" for dismounted infantry) are divisible by 3.  So dismounted infantry can move 2\" in the first move phase, and then 4\" in the second move phase, if they did not fire.Infantry that are dismounted, can also move an additional 6\" at the end of a move, representing a forced march.  This takes place, simultaneously for infantry of both sides, following phase 8 of the turn (i.e. - after everything else, include melee combats).  An infantry element can only force march three rounds in a row, and then has to take a break of a Full turn with no movement.  If an infantry element force marches for two rounds in a row, then it has to take a Half turn rest.  Alternating force march with regular moves mean that no rest periods are needed.What this 'force march' business means is that an infantry element can cover 12\" of tabletop distance in a turn, by force marching (pretty good for most WW2 rules).  Also, while force marching, the infantry can fire, but only at half effect.Terrain, in the game, is officially in four different types - Woods (which may be moderate/light or dense/heavy), Hills (which are assumed to be contoured, like \"wedding cake\" hills), Swamps, and Rivers (which come in 3 classes, or widths).Loading a vehicle is handled very much like old school rules handled Artillery in horse and musket games.  Infantry in Angriff, as regards loading and unloading, can do any two actions.  These can be (1) loading, (2) moving, and (3) unloading.  The same applies to towed guns and equipment.  Large artillery can only be moved by heavy movers, not being manhandled.SightingThe typical sighting distance is 1750 yards, or 35 inches.  The game handles units that are out of LOS, or beyond sighting distance, by using poker chips to represent small groups of troops.Looking into or through woods is even more limited (10\" if looking  into moderate woods; 5\" if looking into dense woods).Rules are in place for how much can be hidden in a building, and how and where visibility markers are replaced by actual units, etc.Artillery FireThe rulebook covers barrage fire, but recommends against it for the scale engagements the rules are representing.  That never stopped a wargamer, however here I will cover the recommended use of artillery pieces in direct fire (and limited indirect fire, such as with a forward observer).So, firing an artillery piece, or even a tank weapon, that is firing High Explosive rounds (rather than armor penetrators) allows the weapon to have an impact on crew members of towed weapons, and exposed infantry, within 2\" of the point of attack of the weapon.  The effect is very simple, and is a number of casualties in that impact circle based on the caliber of the weapon.  If this kills all the crew of a served weapon, then the weapon is also considered destroyed (for game purposes).  Note that such fire is limited to the normal 35\" sighting range.Indirect fire, by using an observer, is allowed for any range up to the maximum for the weapon, as long as an observer is within 35\" of the target.  The rules prohibit towed AT and AA weapons from firing this way, as they were designed and intended to work differently.As mentioned, barrage fire is defined in the rulebook, for artillery assets that might be off board, but it is advised against because it is out of the scope for the engagements envisioned in the rules.  One of the interesting things about barrage fire in these rules is how simply it is handled (another mark for the elegance of these rules).Construct a grid like the one pictured here, on clear acetate (12\"x18\" for HO; 6\"x9\" for Micro).  Place the star over the aiming point of the barrage fire, with the top of the star pointing aligned in the direction of the barrage (i.e. - pointing away from where the firing battery is located).  Then roll 2d6.  If you are using a small battery (i.e. tubes smaller than 135mm), then the two numbers are the squares that are hit by the barrage.  If you are using a large battery, then those two numbers, as well as the sum of the two, are the squares that are hit.  If you roll doubles on the dice, then that is a bad barrage, and only the one square is struck (plus the sum, if a large battery).  The book then gives a series of four charts corresponding to different artillery tube sizes (75-99mm; 100-135mm; 136-175mm; and 176mm and up).  The sum of the two targeting dice are consulted on the corresponding table, and it gives the total number of AFVs, soft vehicles (listed as trucks), and dismounted Men that are killed in each square affected.  Simple, and fast.Direct Fire - Tank and Anti-TankConsidering the era that these rules were first published, and the rarity (at the time) of percentile dice, the method that the rules handle percentage-chance-of-hit for firing direct heavy weapons is rather clever.  Also, consider that for most WW2 land rules, the bread and butter is the tank-on-tank set of adjudication rules - and for Angriff this is no different.  They work well, and that is what makes the ruleset memorable.First, the chance to hit with a weapon is determined from national weapon characteristics tables (in the appendices) that give a basic chance for each range bracket, for each weapon type.  That basic chance represents the typical chance to score a hit, with no significant modifiers.The possible percentage numbers (resulting from the weapons/range chart), along with the hit numbers for 2d6, are:PercentChanceHit on (2d6 scores)78%2 3 4 6 7 8 10 11 1272%3 4 6 7 8 10 1167%2 4 6 7 8 10 1261%4 6 7 8 1050%2 4 6 8 10 1244%6 7 833%4 7 1028%2 6 817%4 1011%3 116%2 12Second, look up that percentage on the Percentage Table (above).  This will then give a number of results on a pair of D6 dice (2-12).  If those results are added up, the percentage is approximately the numbers represented on the table.  Scoring any of those numbers on 2d6 (with one of them being red, more later on that) means a hit is scored.The simplest modifier for this is that if the weapon is stationary (i.e. - did not move this turn) then the number 5 (in the 2-12 spread) is also counted as a hit (if you look at the above chart, you will see that 5 and 9 are never regular hit numbers).  And if both the firing weapon and the target are stationary, then the numbers 5 and 9 are added in as hit results.If firing at a concealed target, the first time firing at it, the percentage table drops one category.Third, determine the effects of a hit.  If against a towed weapon, it is automatically destroyed.  If against another AFV, then the red d6 comes into play.  There is a hit location table, for direct fire combat. It is divided up into five columns, corresponding to the facing of the target vehicle that the hit came in on.  It can come in on the Front, Side, Rear, or Front-Side (front corner), or Rear-Side (rear corner).  Then, the red d6 is consulted, and a location is generated.  These include:Gun ShieldFront TurretFront DriverFront BottomTrackSide hullSide TurretRear HullRear TurretFor each location, the national vehicle characteristics tables will give an armor thickness.  For each range bracket of a weapon, in addition to giving the accuracy of the weapon at that range, the amount of armor penetration is also given.  If the shot penetrates the armor, the target vehicle is dead.Here is an example of the hit location chart.  Assume that the shot is coming in the front of the vehicle, and consult the red d6:Gun ShieldFront TurretFront DriveFront BottomFront DriverTrack This is a very elegant system, again from a time when percentile dice were not common.  Tractics, if I recall, tried to get away from a dice spread that was different from what you could easily do with d6s, and they used a random number generator that was based on 20 numbered chips in a bag, draw one to simulate rolling 1d20.PzMkIV F1Modification/Houserule: Rather than using the d6 system... you could just roll percentile dice against the number you have gotten from the weapon/range chart.  To this add 11% if  you are firing while stationary, and 22% if you AND the target are stationary.  Example: if you get 61% chance, then roll percentile dice, and on a 61 or less, you have a hit.  Of course you then have to roll 1d6 for hit location, and of course, that means that you will lose the charm of certain hit locations not happening on certain percentile rolls (because of how the 2d6 method works), but it means one less chart look up during direct fire adjudication.  This assumes that a modern wargamer could get, and want to use, percentile dice rather than the one pure die type - the sacred d6.Example of direct fire AFV combat -A Panzer Mk IV F1 tank is facing off, face on, against a T34 A.  The range is 1000 yards (20\") and both tanks moved this turn.The MkIV fires a 75mm/L24 gun, so we consult the German chart for that weapon, and find that at 1000 yards the 75mm/L24 has a 44% chance to hit and penetrates 51mm of armor.The T34 fires a 76.2mm/L30 gun, so we consult the Russian chart for that weapon, and find that at 1000 yards, the 76.2mm/L30 has a 61% chance to hit, and penetrates 85mm of armor.The firing is simultaneous.  According to the percentage hit table, the German tank will hit on 6,7, or 8 on the dice.  The Russian tank will hit on 4,6,7,8 or 10 on the dice.The German player rolls, a 3 and a 5, with the 5 being the red dice.  A total of 8 means a hit, on location 5.  Looking at the Front table for hit location (above), we see that a 5 is the Front Driver position of the tank.  Looking at the Russian vehicle table, we find that the T-34 A has only 45mm of armor at that location, so the German gun (which penetrates 51mm) will score a kill.The Russian player rolls a 5 and a 2, with the 2 being the red dice.  A total of 7 means a hit, on location 2.  Looking at the Front table (above), we see that a 2 is the Front Turret position of the tank.  Looking at the German vehicle table, we find that the PzMkIVF1 has only 30mm of armor at that location, so the Russian gun (which penetrates 85mm of armor) will score a kill.T-34/76 A (1941)Direct Fire - Small ArmsThis system is, if anything, even simpler than the tank/anti-tank system.It involves calculating the total number of firing points (from a chart) that are firing on an enemy target (which could be a single stand, a weapon team, a group of stands, or a vehicle).  These points come from infantry stands (1 pt per stand, if it represents 5 or more men), LMGs (2 points), HMGs (3 points), Mortars (2 points), and Flamethrowers (2 points).  there is a slight modification to the total number of points for the range.  Then 2d6 are rolled against a Kill Factor table, which gives a resulting number between 1 and 3.  Multiply the kill factor by the number of calculated points, and that is the number of casualties.  This is simultaneous.If firing small arms at vehicles, the only which may be affected in this system are soft vehicles, and wheeled armored vehicles (such as armored cars).  Tracked AFVs are immune to small arms fire, in this sytem.  Against a soft vehicle, if the vehicle takes small arms fire, and that includes either rifles or MGs, then there is a 50% chance for a hit (roll 2d6, as above, with a hit on 2,4,6,8,10,12).  Further, if the results are either 2, 6 or 8, then it is a kill (otherwise a disable).  Against a wheeled AFV, this chance drops to 33%, so a hit is on 4,7,10.  No chance to kill a wheeled AFV, only disable it.Close CombatAs with Small Arms fire, the close combat system is interesting, works well, and is based on a number of points of Attackers vs Defenders.  Infantry is easy, with 1 point per man involved in a close combat.  Vehicles get points for thickness of armor, and also for the number of machine guns.The procedure is to add all the points for each side in a melee together (Note: a melee is when a group of attackers end their last move of the turn within 1 inch of the defender - this makes for an interesting twist on the turn order - in order to be the attacker you have to be Side A).   Compare the two points totals, and derive a ratio.  The attacker must have at least 1-2 odds in order to attack.  Then the attacker rolls 2d6 on a Melee Effects Table, and it gives a resulting letter.  Look up that letter on the Melee Losses table, and you will find what percentage of Attackers or Defenders have died, in terms of the points for their side.The results on the loss table will be a percentage of loss for each side, and an indicator of which side (attacker or defender) has to retreat (which is a full move for vehicles, and Infantry must retreat 18\" or to the nearest supporting unit).ChargingUnits can charge into combat, which they announce at the start of a turn, then move.  Vehicles get a whole move, and infantry gets 9\".  If contact is not made, then the unit gets no further move that turn, but can engage in small arms fire at half effect.If the charge is successful, then both sides can (possibly - 50% chance) engage in small arms fire before the melee.   This is at point blank range, and the chance is determined by rolling 2d6 (again, the percentage table is consulted, so at 50% success is at a 2,4,6,8,10,12 on the dice).  If this is successful (each side rolls separately), then the Defender can fire at full effect, and the Attacker can fire at half effect.  If the Defender is successful at the 50% test, then he may also introduce reinforcements from units within 6\".On turns after a charge, infantry can only move 2\" and vehicles only 1/3 of their normal move.ExtrasThe rules cover a number of extras including the following:Engineering (including entrenching, vehicle repair, laying bridges, demolition, mines and obstacle breaching, and laying smoke).Urban WarfarMorale (which affects campaign moves and committment to combat) WeatherCapturing equipmentThoughtsAs you could probably tell from my review of the rules' sections above, I am a big fan of Angriff.  Yes, there is the problem of having to consult four different tables for each AFV firing (weapon table for the firer's chance and penetration, percentage table for dice chance, hit table for location, and target vehicle table for armor).  But this is no different from other rule sets.  Consider Overwatch, very similar.  But Angriff plays fast, and it gives great results.  It was relied on by the gaming groups I was in for many years as a means of providing reasonable Infantry (and other small arms fire) adjudication for other tank-centric games (like the already mentioned Overwatch).Some of the problems in the system are the problems of scale - in some places, the scale is different for HO (or more commonly these days, 20mm or 15mm in addition to HO) and Micro scaled vehicles and ranges, but it is never clearly laid out (like the 9\" move for infantry charges - is that only 4.5\" in micro?).  But these are minor problems, and could easily be settled on by a group as a set of rules by practice, rather than rules as written.  It lends itself to all sorts of additional house rules (aircraft, parachuting operations, landings, etc) - but in the end it is a very solid set of move and shoot rules for armor and infantry, with reasonable artillery rules that play fast.More modern rules might do things differently - for instance, I love the command and control rules in Blitzkrieg Commander.  Other rules might introduce a random factor for penetration (such as in Firefly, if I recall).  But as written, for a nice evening game, or a convention game where you want your gamers to know the rules after just a turn or two Angriff is still excellent.My own house rule suggestionsAngriff works great if you prepare vehicle information cards for each side, or a  simple vehicle information sheet, that has the vehicle and weapons stats JUST for the platforms used in your particular game. Add in an extra factor to small arms and close combat for command stands/vehicles.Use the percentile dice system (described above) instead of the Percentage Table."},
{"title": "Sub Roman British Army in Wargaming (Early Dark Ages part 2)", "date": "Sunday, March 5, 2017", "text": "Continuing the discussion on Early Dark Ages Britain, and wargaming in the earlier part of that period.The above is a simple statement, but it begs the question as to how one decides to define what the Dark Ages are . . . but presumably that period between the end of Antiquity, and the beginning of the proper Middle Ages, or Medieval Period.  Of course any definition that is itself based on non-specific terms opens up further labeling cans-of-worms, but it generally works out to about 400AD until about 1000AD, more or less.  Rather than putting a year on it, I think it is more useful (both here in wargaming, and also in my history studies) to consider identifiable periods.  It is still an abstract way to define a time period in history, but it gives some definition to the reader.  So, for the Gaming with Chuck discussion, the Dark Ages in Britain is roughly from the end of the Roman presence in the Isles, until the coming of the Normans.  And further dividing that, into an early Dark Ages, which runs from the end of the Romans, until the time of Alfred the Great, and the later period, from Alfred until the Normans (including the majority of the Viking age). - Gaming with Chuck HQLooking at this period, as we saw in the prior article, a major military force to consider are the various British kingdoms that inherited from the Roman traditions, and fought against (and absorbed, in some cases) a variety of invading peoples.  This article will take a look at the army list representations of the Sub-Roman British in a variety of different \"generic\" rulesets.  By that, I mean the rules that cater for a broad variety of ancient and/or medieval history, but that provide for specific army lists for military organizations within that period of history. These are referred to as the Sub-Roman British, or sometimes (more rarely) the Post-Roman British.  Taking a look at the WRG Army List, Book 2, listing from 1982, we see that army number 82 is:Sub-Roman British425 AD to 945 ADC-in-C mounted on horse equipped as heaviest cavalry type present (or on foot as Light-Heavy Infantry, with Javelin or Long Thrusting Spear and Shield). 1 per army.

Up to 9.The army is interesting, and of course the minimums of the various Mercenary groups and Allied groups (Saxons, Irish, Visigoths and Franks) only apply if any of that nationality are used..Ignoring the Mercenary and Allied troops for a minute, the core of the army are the actual Britons -Cavalry (light and heavy), Spearmen, and Archers.  This will be followed throughout the other army lists, and while it is probably true (enough) it also seems somewhat generic for an army of this time period and place.  With what historical evidence that exists, this is probably enough.The text that goes along with the list is interesting.  It reads as follows:This list covers British and Breton armies from the rise to power of Vortigern until the absorption of the last remaining British lowland kingdom, Strathclyde.  I assume that earlier armies still follow the Late Imperial Roman pattern, that the Welsh diverge early on because of their mountain environment, and that the Bretons assimilate close to the French military system after the mid-9th century.  All these points are of course susceptible of being questioned.  I have relied mainly on near-contemporary literary evidence, and reluctantly discarded the reconstructions of historical fiction from Geoffrey of Monmouth onwards.  1,000 praying monks appeared at a battle in 614 AD, and were attacked first by a pagan opponent who decided that those who invoked the gods against him could not fairly claim the privileges of non-combatants.  Saxons were hired by Vortigern in the 5th century, Irish and a homeless Visigothic fleet in the 6th, and Franks possibly in the 9th.  The option to use 4 \"Regular A\" cavalry in attendance on the C-in-C represents a 100-strong \"round table\" for an Arthur or similar personality.  They cannot be used together with praying monks.  Surviving literature proves conclusively that cavalry were armed with javelins and usually wore mail.  Horse armour was used throughout the period by some of the Bretons of Armorica, so its use in Britain during the 6th century cannot be ruled out.  \"Regular D\" cavalry represents surviving units of the Dux's northern border army, and \"Regular D\" infantry other of his units and militia raised by the southern lowland cities.  No regulars can be used after the 6th century.  LTS (long thrusting spear) had probably replaced JLS (javelin/light spear) as the standard British infantry weapon by the end of the 5th century, and was to remain that of the north Welsh and southern Scotland throughout the medieval period.  The use of LB (longbow) by south Welsh archers was a later development.Some interesting comments here.First, referring Geoffrey of Monmouth as 'historical fiction'.  I am still chewing on that comment, 30 years after first reading it.  I get that some of Geoffrey is fantastic, but then again so is Livy and Polybius - not to mention Herodotus, the father of lies.  Geoffrey is propaganda, trying to create a history that exemplifies a British, but not English, origin - and he is prone to the fantastic, but he at least attempts to stay with known sequences of events and sources.  And if you accept Geoffrey's sources as history for some things, why not others?  Especially where he agrees with Gildas, Bede, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, William of Malmesbury, Wace, and others? So, I am willing to think of him as non-rigorous history, but not quite historical fiction.Second, within little statements, huge history is hiding - such as the statement about using the Saxons in the 5th century, because 'Saxons were hired by Vortigern'.  Of course, Big V hired the two Saxon leaders, Horsa and Hengist, and from them we get the militarized arrival of the Saxons coming to establish lands and kingdoms for themselves, eventually creating the Anglo Saxon people.  But, at least for a while, the Romanized Britons held out against the Saxons, first Vortigern against the mutinying Saxon mercenaries, then Arthur against the encroaching Saxon immigrants/invasion.Moving on to another view by WRG, we see in DBA (looking at my original 1990 copy), army number 82 (retaining the numbering system from the earlier army list books) is in residence.  Using the DBA element system, for a 12-element army, we see the following.3x 3CV (Cavalry)1x 3Kn or 2LH (Knights, or Light Horse)4x 3Ax (Auxilia)2x 3Ax, or 2x 3/4Wb (Auxilia or Warband)2x 2Ps (Psiloi).The general of the army would be one of the CV stands (unless the knight is used?).  The 3 CV stands represent the British cavalry, of course.  The option of 3Kn, or 2LH is either Knights (Visigoth or Scottish mounted), or Light Horse (the British light cavalry).  The Knights option is also for players who envision an Arthur, and his knights or comitatus, as heavier armed (or simply elite) cavalry compared to other specimens of the period.Moving ahead to other interpretations, we can look at the army as presented in Bob Bryant's excellent Might of Arms rules.  They have armies based on the earlier WRG army books, and other sources, but rather than giving figure counts, they give numbers of stands per unit type.  They give (again, stretching the point up to 945AD, to include the last remaining British kingdom at Strathclyde - in practical terms. the British were done as a force roughly around 580AD or so) the army's details as the following:Medium Cavalry (C morale) 6-24 standsLight Cavalry, Javelin (C morale) 0-12 standsSubheavy Infantry (C morale) 0-12 standsMedium Infantry (C morale) 24-102 standsSkirmish Infantry, Javelin (C morale) 0-12 standsSkirmish Infantry, Bow (C morale) 0-6 standsThe Subheavy Infantry here represent either Frankish or Saxon allies (Horsa and Hengist again?).  Options exist to convert up to two units (using the recommended unit size of 3 cav or 6 foot stands) of Medium Cavalry to Heavy Cavalry, also the option to convert up to two units of cavalry (either Medium, or the upgraded Heavy) to B morale.  Again, the Knights of Arthur, or some Dux' comitatus is the inspiration here, it seems.Terry Gore's most excellent rules, Medieval Warfare, offer up an Arthurian Britons army (mid 5th to mid 6th century).  This does not go on to cover the surviving Britons, but focuses on the main event.  It is interesting, and of course the units are different here from some of the other rulesets, but here is the army list:8-24 stands Cambrogi (Heavy Cav, Warriors, Jav or Spear and Shield)4-16 stands Light Cavalry (Skirmishing Cav, Warriors, Jav and Shield)24-72 stands Spearmen (Lightly Armored Infantry, Poor, Jav or Spear and Shield)6-24 stands Archers (Lightly Armored Infantry, Poor, Bow)0-16 stands Saxon Ally (Unarmored Infantry, Warrior or Warband, Spear and Shield)6-18 stands Skirmishers (Skirmishing Infantry, Warriors, Javelin or Bow and Shield)0-6 ships These rules give some more tactical details - for instance, they allow the Spearmen and the Archers to form mixed units.Once again, the Cambrogi can upgrade to Veterans if they like.Equally, the Cambrogi can upgrade to Full Mail Cavalry, Elite Morale, Lance and Shield (Arthurian cavalry according to just about everyone from Geoffrey on down the line to John Boorman).Options to upgrade the training and morale of the spearmen and archers exist.  The writer of the list (it appears in the rulebook, as published by Foundry) refers to the Heavy Cavalry as Cambrogi - which he defines as \"Literally, fellow countryment.  British warriors who supported the remnants of the Roman leaders.  Well armed and armoured as well as loyal followers and trusted fighters, they often served as personal bodyguards.\" Taking a look at a recent element based (in the same vein as DBA and Armati, where you can either move elements singly or as groups) ruleset, L'Art De La Guerre comes to us from Herve Caille in France.  A very nice English translation is available, and it is a lovely book with lots of data, rules, and ideas for games in it.  The Sub Roman British are available here, as army number #101 - Romano-British.  Again, the army stretches from early 5th century (407AD, in this case) on up to the year 945AD.  The army list gives the option for doing an Arthurian list, with the de rigeur option of upgrading the cavalry, in that case.Britons Horsemen (may be medium or heavy cavalry) 4-8 unitsScouts on Pony (light cavalry with javelin, mediocre) 0-2 unitsSpearmen (medium or heavy spearmen, may be mediocre) 8-24 unitsSaxon Mercenaries before 442AD (heavy swordsmen, impetuous; may be elite) 0-2 unitsIrish Mercenaries before 580AD (medium swordsmen) 0-4 unitsBowmen (light infantry with bow) 0-2 unitsLight Infantry with Javelin 0-2 unitsChristian Martyrs before 664AD (levy, mediocre, expendable) 0-1 unitsFortifications 0-8 unitsArthurian Elite Cavalry 475 to 539AD (Replace Horsemen with heavy cavalry, impact, elite) 0-4 unitsAn interesting army, carrying on much of a muchness with the others (spearmen, archers, light and heavy horse, allies), but this one introduces the idea of fortifications.  Camelot?  The Christian Martyrs represent great flavor, but little tactical usefulness that I can think of.  If they were a religious standard, that might be more useful.  A player can choose allies from Western Romans, Saxons, Welsh or Vikings in different periods.  If sticking to the strictly Arthurian slice as defined here (475-539) then only the Welsh are available, the others being either earlier or later historical allies.Some interest creeps in with the Shock of Impact army list, written for the Romano-British Successor (Army 48, page 27 in the army list book), for the Shock of Impact rules from Tabletop Games.  These army lists give you two ways to construct an army.  First, the typical method, where you employ a set of points with unit types, minimums and maximums.  The second is by means of a set of percentage dice, to determine an army of so-many units.  That is interesting for our study here.  Automatic, Army General (Heavy Cavalry)01-17 Heavy Cavalry (HC, spear javelin, shield)18-34 Retainer Cavalry (MC, spear, javelin, shield)35-37 Pict/Scot Cavalry (MC, spear shield)28-40 Pict/Scot Cavalry (LC, javelin, shield)41-52 Pict Javelinmen (LI, javelin, shield)53-58 Pict Archers (LI, bow)59-76 Pict/Scot/Saxon Infantry (MI, spear, shield)77-100 British Spearman (MI, spear shield)The interesting thing here, of course, is the commonality of Picts.  The Saxons are present, of course.  The army list allows you to upgrade (of course) the army general and the Heavy Cavalry to regular troops.  The British Spearman are, in the army list, of higher morale than the Picts/Scots/Saxons.  Considering that the Saxons are professional mercenaries, I find that encouraging for the depiction of the British from these authors.Another interesting thing about these rules, compared to the others covered already, is that these really focus on the period of the 5th and 6th century.  It makes no pretense to cover the periods that stretch up into the 10th century with the dubious hangers-on at Strathclyde, etc.Returning back to an army list that covers the gamut from 410AD to 945AD, the excellent rules by Neil Thomas (Ancient and Medieval Wargaming, 2007) cover the Romano-British Army.  Here we see four troop types, with a variation in number of units the player choosesCavalry (HC, medium armor, elite) 2-4 unitsRoman Remnants (DAI, medium armor, average) 0-2 unitsMilitia (DAI, light armour, levy) 2-4 unitsArchers (LI, bow, light armour, average) 0-2 unitsAs usual, the option to upgrade the cavalry (again, as Knights of the Round Table, Comitatus, descendants of Sarmatians, etc - it isn't clear, but bows to the scant history and rich legend) exists, making up to one unit of Cavalry into Knight Cavalry (HC, heavy armour, elite), with some extra hand-to-hand combat capabilities on turns that they charge.  The army does not permit the Roman Remnant past the end of the 6th century, but they are allowed to fight using a shield wall technique.I have long been a fan of Neil Thomas' simple rules, and the Dark Ages variant that this list supports is no exception.  Easy to teach, easy to play, and it gives appropriate results - great for a newcomer.  With this army list, someone interested in either the historical period, or a plausible historical Arthur could get playing very quickly.  Mr. Thomas again disparages the excellent (but, sadly, not-so-very-exacting in the historicity department) Geoffrey of Monmouth.Finally, a look at an army list that provides for some more options than most of the lists (the most options, so far, being on the original 5th/6th edition WRG army lists, but most of the variation there came from listing different allied armies separately - Saxons, Irish, Visigoths and Franks.  But this last ruleset I am covering here is De Bellis Multitudinis.  In Book 2 (500BC to 476AD) of the army list collection, using the June 1993 version here as reference, we see the following Sub-Roman British army (407AD to 945AD), which is army number 81 on page 71:C-in-C, Regular Cavalry or Irregular CavalryBritish ally general, Reg Cavalry or Irregular Cavalry; 0-3Cavalry Reg Cavalry or Irregular Cavalry; 8-15Light Cavalry on Hill Ponies - Irregular Light Horse; 0-5Pedyts - Regular Auxilia or Irregular Spear; 36-120Archers - Regular Bow, or Irregular Psiloi; 0-8And that is it, for the basic army.  As with Shock of Impact, the option exists for the General(s) and the Cavalry to be either regular or irregular, depending on the player view of the situation.  But, there is a long list of other elements that can be added in for various sub-periods and special cases of the army.  Before 425 AD, Late Imperial Roman allies are available429 AD, Saxon mercenaries and longboats are available (Horse and Hengist ride again)430-441 AD, Saxon Allies475-539 AD, Arthur properly done, with Cavalry and General upgraded to Regular Knights507-550 AD, Visigothic fleet and crew, shipwrecked and part of the armyMainland Britain before 580 AD, Irish Mercenary (or Votadini foot)Armorica before 580 AD, Alan Mercenaries (from Alan army list in Book 2)Prior to 664 AD, Praying Monks (irregular horde)After 790 AD, Viking Allies (from Norse army list in Book 3)This is, at it's heart, very much apace with the other armies listed here, but the historical detail given with the list options, and in the book text, make for a very nice snapshot of the history of the British from the 5th century until their disappearance.  The Praying Monks are back, which is a good thing.  How a single stand of them could make a difference, I don't know, but they would be a fun addition to the army. Not the Arthur being discussed hereThis is the wrap up of this article on the general representation of the army. The agreement is on fair (mediocre) quality infantry, and better quality cavalry.  Under a cavalry commander, such as an Arthur like figure, the cavalry can be improved.  This is a pretty good representation, but there are some rulesets that go a little deeper, especially for this time period. The next article will take a look at some Arthur specific rulesets (and modules) including:Song of Arthur and MerlinDux BellorumThe Age of Arthur (for Warhammer Ancient Battles)I could include the SAGA supplement on the Sub-Roman British, and also the excellent Glutter of Ravens.  The former, I will leave off, because I have an article just on SAGA planned for the next period after this - the age of Vikings.  The latter, I will leave off, because the author (Dan Mersey) is already covered in two other rulesets by him (Song of Arthur and Merlin, and Dux Bellorum), which are currently much more accessible to gamers than the former (but still excellent) Glutter of Ravens.For grins and giggles, see the BBC documentary on \"historical\" Arthur from Francis Pryor.  I enjoy Francis, but he certainly does seem to be attracted to out-of-the-mainstream theories about pre-Roman, Roman, and Post-Roman Britain.  Here is the first part of a three part video on facebook that presents his documentary on the Arthur topic.There are two more parts of this video, also.Part 2 - https://youtu.be/N_tMiA1KBPMPart 3 - https://youtu.be/8iksrDIQWUAThere are of course many other \"documentaries\" on Arthur to be found on Youtube and elsewhere, some are more or less dreadful, and others might be useful, but as in the first article in this series, nothing (for narrative) beats John Morris. Although even he (rightfully so) has his critics."},
{"title": "Medieval Periods - Early Dark Ages (5th century)", "date": "Wednesday, February 15, 2017", "text": "Early Dark Ages Wargaming You say 'Sub-Roman' I say 'Arthurian'A very interesting time for study and gaming in British military history is the period of the various kingdoms and migrations/invasions that took place between the 5th and 9th centuries, AD.  The armies are small, much of the surviving historical matter (which is, admittedly, very little) is steeped in legend as much as in fact, and Dark Ages Briton is a nice compact area for any sort of strategic study in warfare or wargaming.  That applies also to campaigns, linking together tactical studies and games.  Especially miniature wargaming.For a wargamer this is a rich time to investigate this period of history.  There are, of course, many great miniatures and wargaming rules available for miniature gaming play (some covered in this article).  But there is also a load of great modern fiction and television that covers the period.  There is the excellent series (The Last Kingdom) of historical fiction from Bernard Cornwell.  There is even a BBC series based on the same novels.  A really fun young adult novel from the last century is The Dragon and the Raven, written by the fantastic author of such things, G.A. Henty (excellent review here at Vintage Books).  A terrific list of fiction from the period (modern, and less-than-modern), along with historical resources, is on this page about King Arthur available at Abe Books.  Much more is available, if you look for historical fiction in the Anglo-Saxon period, or even moving up into the early Viking Age.There is, of course, the temptation to immediately jump to the historical archetypes for King Arthur - a sub-roman Briton, perhaps a descendant of a Roman soldier, or himself trained as a Roman soldier, or cavalry officer, with a small but well trained band of warriors, that has an unduly large effect on the local political/military situation.  But there are also other interesting historical events during these centuries - the arrival of the Saxons.  The generation of the first Christian kingdoms.  The (almost) loss of the Christian culture to the Germanic.  The rise of Alfred the Great as king of the West Saxons.  The burning of cakes in a swamp cottage.  Eventually the establishment of the Danelaw.I'd like to take a look at the first part of this period, the Arthurian period, in the rest of this article (covering the later part of the period in the future).  Roughly that is the 5th and 6th centuries, AD.  I am assuming this period for Arthur, and not the earlier possibility for Lucius Artorius Castus (probably 2nd or 3rd century AD) as the historical figure.  That Arthur, of course, was an incredible soldier and deserves to be remembered to both history and legend, if even half of the inscriptions about him are correct, but as I am focusing on this period in Britain, any references to Arthur will be to this possible post-Roman Arthur.A fantastic amount history on the period exists from lots and lots of different authors.  John Morris (The Age of Arthur) is a favorite, as is Leslie Alcock (Arthur's Britain).  Geofrey Ashe, although later on the field, also gives a good tilt with The Discovery of King Arthur, incorporating more modern evidence.  Ashe actually predates Morris (the 73 version) and Alcock (71) with The Quest for Arthur's Britain (1968).Uniquely wonderful work by Angus McBride - from OspreyThere are many more, a short list starts on the Abe Books community page on the Age of Arthur (referenced earlier, for the fiction listed there).  A nice introduction to the period from an academic viewpoint is available here from Mark Gardner.  If you have access, the Great Courses title King Arthur: History and Legend from Prof. Dorsey Armstrong is quite excellent, and covers such modern topics as Hollywood treatments, and even Monty Python (along with a great survey of all the historical literature - Monmouth through Mallory, and many others beside).Dorsey Armstrong lecture series - Excellent! Of the list of resources above, the introduction to the wider period by Gardner, and the Morris and Alcock books are properly Sub-Roman British history, the others are peculiarly Arthurian (albeit with one foot firmly in history, in all cases).  A most excellent survey of serious historical works on Sub-Roman Britain can be found in the article by Snyder at the Vortigern Studies website.Online there is a fantastic historical resource available from History File that has an interactive map of the various kingdoms of this period, each providing a resources page with notable leaders and historic events of those kingdoms.There is an extremely useful Fashion of the Centuries website with a history of Anglo Saxon costume (both civilian and military) from 460AD to 1066AD.A lot has been written on Arthur, and whether or not he existed, was he just a prototype of an actual warrior, just a fiction?  I am going to concentrate here, on the version that a lot of Arthurian scholars might say is the best chance of being close to a historic personage.  This is the Arthur of the 5th/6th century - not the Arthur we find in the later Romance fictions (such as the excellent works all after Geoffrey of Monmouth - including Chretien De Troyes, Mallory, and later authors).  A reasonable web resource is a series of articles written by Barry Jacobsen and published on his military history website The Deadliest Blogger (a corrected, and reordered, version of the series is on Scout, linked below).  The articles are accompanied by loads of images and paintings from things like Osprey manuals, and other sources, but the information is sound, and of interest to a potential gamer interested in this period.The Age of Arthur (in 21 parts) - Part One starts hereThe end of Roman Rule in BritainVortigern's struggle for powerThe Defense of Roman BritanniaThe Armies of Vortigern and HengistThe Saxon TerrorAmbrosius AurelianusShadow in the EastBritain Stands AloneOrigins of ArthurPossible Origins of ArthurCerdic the SaxonThe Lindsey CampaignArthur's Northern CampaignWar to the KnivesThe City of the LegionDux BellorumRevolt in the NorthThe Hill of AgnedA Gathering of WolvesArthur Returns SouthThe Battle of Badon HillThis is a fun to read series, and has a lot of valuable references in it.  One of the things that the author, Jacobsen, does here is cover (in reasonable detail, given how much evidence we have available) the 12 battles of Arthur, as recorded by Nennius, the Welsh Monk responsible for writing History of the Britons, at around the year 828 AD.  He covers Arthur with surprising detail, given that earlier Arthur references were mostly in folklore and settled into the mythology of a variety of peoples.  Nennius relates Arthur's battles to specific places, and describes (somewhat detailed) the effect it had on the Saxon leadership.  Whether or not these battles were actually fought (and won) by a war leader (Dux Bellorum, or simply Dux) named Arthur is not as important, for the wargamer, as the fact that they are descriptions of plausible Dark Ages battles.  The book was written in the height of, or even the late, Dark Ages, but the battles described certainly go back to the first century or so after the departure of Roman authority in the isles.  The twelve battles, as described by Nennius, are:1. Battle at the River Glein2., 3., 4., and 5. The Campaign in Lindsey6. The River Bassas7. The Celyddon (Caledonian) Forest8. Guinnion Fort9. The City of the Legion10. The River Tribuit11. Agned Hill12. Badon HillFor a wargamer of the period interested in the geography of Britain, there is a nice article describing the sites mentioned in the Nennius account, online, as the 28 Cities of Britain by David Nash Ford.  Using that information, along with the descriptions of Arthur's 12 battles would make for a nice set of wargaming scenarios.A lot of gaming resources are available for this period, but one that I have always enjoyed (and made use of a few times) is the Diplomacy Variant known as Bretwalda (or, specifically, Bretwalda-2).  This is a variant map and some additional rules for the British Isles (including Ireland) starting in the year 620.  The kingdoms involved are:DalriadaEast AngliaGwyneddKernowLeinsterMerciaNorthumbriaPictlandWessex Years ago we ran a fantasy campaign of \"Hordes of the Things\" set on that map, with special rules for Merlin and a Dragon (non player units that roamed the map, randomly, and affected armies).  There was also a possibility of a great sea serpent swallowing up any fleet that remained at sea over a turn.Earlier on Gaming with Chuck, the most excellent supplement for Warhammer Historical Battles that covers this period was covered, the Age of Arthur.  It is a great book, with historical armies for the period, tons of evocative art and pictures of perfectly painted miniatures, and a great selection of scenarios.Sometimes it seems as if Daniel Mersey is keeping the dream alive for early medieval wargaming these days - first he had Glutter of Ravens (Arthurian rules and information from Outpost Wargame Services), then it was Dux Bellorum (Arthurian rules and lists,etc, from Osprey), and these days it is Lion Rampant (general medieval from Osprey) and Dragon Rampant (fantasy heir to the previous).  Great games, all of them, and Daniel (as an archaeologist, I believe) is well suited in his medieval knowledge, and certainly in his Arthurian knowledge.  Not pictured below, he is author author of Song of Arthur and Merlin from Ganesha Games.  Answers and discussions about Dan Mersey games can be found at the Dux Rampant forums.In recent years, the ruleset Saga has really taken off, and it covers the expanded Viking age, including some of the period in discussion here.  With the supplements, they tend towards the later part of the period - solidly in the Viking Age, and beyond (1066 is not the end for these rules . . .).  Extremely popular.  Lots of great websites and resources for Saga, but the fan run Tapestry is a great spot for info.  One of the things that has made Saga more interesting (to me) for this period is the recent supplement, Aetius and Arthur, covering the Sub-Roman (Arthurian) period of Britain.  Excellent...Finally, there are (in the miniatures category) the wide, wide variety of general miniatures rules that cover this period.  This goes back to the earliest days (Grant, Featherstone, Bath) and on up through WRG, many others, and today's offerings such as Warrior, DBM, DBA, Art De La Guerre, Field of Glory and many others.  Some have been reviewed on this blog, and I have long been a fan of Might of Arms.  The Hail Caesar rules (Rick Priestley) are extremely popular, and Warlord is doing a great job of supporting the rules with fantastic figures - both metal and plastic.  Their army book covering Late Antiquity to Early Medieval is a perfect companion for battles from this time period. The Warlord website has loads of information and articles about the rules, armies, painting, etc.These days, I am also very much a fan of the (the late) Terry Gore rules - especially the reprint that Foundry did a few years back, \"Medieval Warfare\".  These start in the year 450AD (the same year that the other set from Terry Gore - \"Ancient Warfare\" - ends).  Army lists are included, and the Foundry version (not surprisingly) has great art internally.  The cover is a bit garish, but hey - it catches your attention!Because of their interest in the period, and because of the fantastic figures they have come out with support for Tomahawk Studios and SAGA, the miniatures manufacturer Gripping Beast has a ton of great figures for this time period (Dark Ages).  They have recently come out with their own set of big battle rules, that look pretty good, but I have not read them or played them yet.  They are called Swordpoint, by Martin Gibbins. Wargames Illustrated has posted a great video introduction to the rules.  Well worth watching, if you think they might serve for this period.Lots more can be done, and this article should be followed up with a second on the Later Dark Ages.  A separate article on the boardgames covering this time period is also warranted, but this is an introductory piece, and I wanted to share some images and links that I have had lurking around in my bookmarks list.  I hope they are useful."},
{"title": "General Quarters - review", "date": "Sunday, January 29, 2017", "text": "This is another review in the Once and Future Rules series, of wargame rules that are out of print, but that got a lot of play at one time (at least, in the clubs and groups I played in since the early 1980s). This is the second set of naval rules that I am reviewing in this series (the first, was Seekrieg).  Please note that this review is of the old (1975) version of General Quarters. The new version (GQIII and the WW1 version, Fleet Action Imminent) from Old Dominion Gameworks are excellent games, but they are different enough (and improved in many ways), that I felt like a review of the old school rules was warranted.  Besides, the older ones are still popular in our club.In 1975, L.L. Gill published General Quarters.  These were originally published by Brookhurst Hobbies, and then by C-in-C (the version I have of GQ1 is from C-in-C), and these days by Navwar (I believe that in spite of the new version from ODGW, that Navwar continues to publish GQ1 and GQ2).  From the cover, these are \"Complete and Comprehensive Rules for Naval Wargaming\".  It is hard to argue.  Although in comparison with the Seekrieg rules, they are certainly Naval Wargaming in a different language.  I came to these rules as the third set of commercial miniatures naval rules I ever read.  The first was Seekrieg.  The second was Heart of Oak (from FGU, 1978).  And then there was General Quarters.  I found them in one of several boxes of miniatures rules that were for sale at Campaign Headquarters.  Looking through them, they seemed so very simple.  I had played several naval wargames, by the mid 80s (when I came across GQ) - including Wooden Ships and Iron Men (Avalon Hill, at least the version I had), Battlewagon (Task Force Games), Fire when Ready! (Metagaming), and Fast Attack Boats (Yaquinto).  I had read several books about Naval Wargaming, as mentioned in the Seekrieg article - these contained several miniatures rulesets.  So, when I came to GQ, I did not have the newcomer's eye.  It looked very simple, and couldn't possibly be any good.  And what was that turning gauge all about? And the broadside indicator?Finally, however, in the late 1980s, I got a copy of GQ, at the suggestion of a friend, to look at the torpedo rules.  Which had to be an improvement on the torpedo rules in Seekrieg. At least from the perspective of play-ability.  At this time, I had also written my own set of naval rules, covering modern small craft (river craft, hovercraft, and small patrol boats) for a modern warfare campaign.  I began to appreciate the essence of simplicity. And that was what GQ offered - sensible systems, that have the detail backed into the calculations and factors, that offered a quick game, with good (historical) results.  The systems worked so well, and lacked complexity, so that many aspects of WW2 naval combat could be very easily incorporated, where they caused heartache in other rulesets.  I became (and remain) hooked.ScaleAs with most naval games (but not all) a single model represents a single naval asset (ship, submarine, etc).  Very small craft (such as motor torpedo boats), and aircraft, are represented by a single model for a group.  Torpedoes (except a very few special cases, such as the Japanese Long Lance) are resolved in a single turn, so aren't marked on the tabletop.The surface scale is 1\" to 250 yards (8\" to a nautical mile).  Not that this is half the size of the table top scale for Seekrieg, by comparison.The time scale is 6 minutes to a turn (10 turns to an hour).  A quick mathematician will point out that a 30kt vessel, in 6 minutes, can travel 24\" on the tabletop.  However, the ruleset has purposefully halved the movement distance of all the vessels in the game (so the 30kt vessel can travel a total of 12 inches), to keep people from steaming all over the place (and requiring a shorter turn, or smaller scale, as Seekrieg does).  Engagements are best played on a large-ish tabletop, or floor, with long range shots of 9-12 feet not being too extreme for large guns.  With smaller (more reasonable) guns, such as on cruisers and destroyers, a much smaller play surface would suffice, as would converting inches to CM, or halving everything.A quick note about distances - the game gives distances (movement, and gunnery) in inches.  It is quick to mentally convert this to thousands of yards, or nautical miles, but as inches it makes it very easy to play.Turn SequenceThe game is (thankfully) played without any movement plotting at all.  In fact, no written orders are required for anything (except aircraft operations, and torpedo runs).  So, because of that, there is an integrated turn sequence that works quite well.1. Ship Movement  a) Side A moves and lays smoke screens  b) Side B moves and lays smoke screens. (the two sides alternate being side A)  c) Collisions are resolved  d) Ships in minefields are checked for detonation  e) Mine damage takes effect2. Torpedoes hit targets - those fired on the preceding game turn reach their targets (or two turns ago, if Japanese long lance torpedoes).  If there is an interception, then damage is calculated.  Immediate effects of damage.3. Air attacks  a) Air to Air combat  b) AA fire against aircraft attempting surface strikes  c) Surviving aircraft conduct strikes on targets  d) Damage from all air strikes takes effect immediately4. Gunnery combat  a) Search lights illuminate targets during light action  b) Gunnery attacks resolved for both sides  c) Damage from gunnery takes effect immediately5. Torpedoes are launched (for next turn) by both sides.6. Repair  a) Damage Control hits (Critical Hit #3) may be attempted to be repaired  b) Fires in CVs, CVEs, AKs and AOs may attempt to be extinguished  c) Stationary ships (i..e - non functioning engine room) may attempt to regain power  d) Ships which sink this game turn are removed from the table7. Smoke Screens laid the previous turn are removed. (we found it useful to have them be modeled as black cotton on the turn they are laid, and on this phase, remove all white smoke, and then turn all black smoke to white)MovementMovement is quite simple.  It is marked on the Ship Display as a number of inches, based on how much damage the hull (and, by extension, the engine room) has taken.  A ship may move that many inches ahead.Turning is done by the use of a small gauge, that allows a 45 degree turn for each inch (or more) traveled ahead.  In practice this is a very simple procedure, and can be done without the gauge - although it proves useful for tight areas.  Very small craft (Motor Torpedo Boats) can turn on a dime, up to 180 degrees.Acceleration and Deceleration is by 3\".  This is 4\" for small vessels (DD and smaller).  Note that this is based on the distance the ship moved last turn, so if the engine room gets severely damage, and the maximum speed drops from 12\" to 6\" in a single turn, the ship can still only decelerate by 3\" (but will be forced to do so each turn, until it reaches it's new maximum speed, based on damage).Ships within an inch of each other are in danger of collision (unless, one is attempting to secure a tow of the other).Ships within four inches of a land mass are in danger of running aground (shoals and reefs, of course).  The referee can introduce any sort of terrain he desires - including additional areas where a ship can run aground.Ships should be divided up into divisions of 2 to 8 vessels, and move either line ahead, line abreast, or in an oblique formation.  Ships must remain in a division, but can reform.  Special exceptions are when avoiding torpedo attacks, or because of the effects of damage, etc.Small ships can use evasive action.  There are also detailed rules for collisions, towing, and smoke screens.GunneryThe rules for gunnery determine who may shoot (based on line of sight, line of fire, spotting, radar, and so on).  Each ship that is armed has one or more batteries (on large ships, there are main, secondary, and tertiary batteries - which may also be AA guns).  Fire against a target is by a complete battery.  It is probable that a ship has a secondary (or tertiary) battery that is identical on each side (port and starboard) of a ship.  The main battery, if it is comprised of center line turrets, is singular, although it may be split between fore and aft, based on whether the turrets involved are those before, or behind, the main superstructure of the ship.The rules determine how to make sense of this battery stuff, although some knowledge of the layout of the ship is helpful - we found that a reprint of a WW2 era Jane's Fighting Ships proved invaluable (the sort that can be had cheap at a book store or Amazon).  I prefer Conway's to Jane's, but my copies of Conway's all disappeared years ago.  Sad tale.Once you determine which battery is firing (which is really amazingly simple, I've spent too much time discussing it here), your ship data will have a note of the gun caliber, and also the AF (attack factor) for that battery.  Using the gun caliber, find the entry on the straddle table that represents the range bracket you are in, and a \"to hit\" number for a D6 is there.  If this number is rolled, on a D6, then your battery has scored a straddle (it hit the target).  There are a number of modifiers for this, and there are two sets of \"to hit\" numbers, one for day actions, and one for night actions, but it is extremely easy to understand (and, more importantly for convention play, to teach).Example - The straddle chart is easy to read - find the column that corresponds to your battery you are firing.  Then find the row that lists the lowest range value that exceed the actual range you are from the target.  So, if you are firing a 12\" battery, at a range of 88 inches (11 nautical miles) on the tabletop, consulting the table, we find that the lowest value that exceeds 88 inches, is a 96.  If this is a daylight engagement, we see that a dice score of a 1 or 2 is needed on a D6 to score a straddle at that range. The Straddle TableThat is it.  Compared to the hit determination sequence in Seekrieg, this is fiddler's green.  In fact, most players will roll three dice at once - a white, a black, and a red.  The white dice is to see if a hit is scored, the black dice it to check for hull damage, and the red dice is to check for armament damage.Damage  Once you score a straddle, the next bit of gunnery detail is to determine if you have scored any damage.  This involves (first) noting from the straddle table, the entry of the range bracket will note an Armor Type that will be penetrated.  This is in (basic terms) of ship class, and it and all lesser ship classes are penetrated by that gun, at that range bracket.  So, for instance, given the example above, of a 12\" gun firing at a range of 88 inches, we find that the entry on the straddle table (the 96\" entry) states that a 12\" gun at that point will penetrate CA (Heavy Cruiser) armor, or lighter.If a battery scores a hit against a target that it cannot penetrate, it can still do damage, but it will be Non-Penetrating Damage.The next step in determining damage is to see what the straddle did.  Compare the AF (attack factor) of the battery, against the DF (defense factor) of the target ship.  This will allow you to compute a ratio.  Round the ratio in the favor of the defender, and consult the Gunnery Combat Results Table.  Remember that you rolled three dice (white is \"to hit\", black is \"hull damage\" and red is \"armament damage\").  The black dice entry on the chart, for the ratio of AF to DF, gives the number of damage points to the target ship's hull.  The red dice gives the number of damage points to the target ship's armament.SDS of a Japanese Cruiser - three rows of boxes - Critical Damage, Armament, and Hull These damage points represent boxes that are crossed off, from left to right, on the Ship Display Summary (SDS).  This is the box that represents the ship, and has the basic info for the game on batteries, movement, armor, etc.  Each point of damage represents a box crossed off, either on the Armament Row (which has attack factors for the main battery, and secondary battery, and torpedoes), or on the Hull Row (which has the current maximum speed listed in inches).  When all the Hull boxes are crossed off, a ship will sink.  When all hull boxes that have numbers in them are lost, but the ship has not sunk, then the ship may not move (although there are rules for emergency restarts of the engine room, giving a basic movement capability).If the target ship's armor is NOT PENETRATED, then armament damage does not affect Main Batteries (but will affect secondaries and toredoes).  Also, if the ship's armor is NOT PENETRATED, then hull damage is halved.If the hull dice (the black one) is a '2', this means that an additional dice roll can be made for a Critical Hit.  Roll 1d6 and consult the critical damage table.Notice that critical hits number 4,5,6 have an (A) - that means that the armor of the target ship must have been penetrated for this one to take place.  If not, then there is no effect for these results.TorpedoesTorpedoes do require a small amount of record keeping.  When launched, a note of the position of the launching ship should be made, and also the target ship.  The player launching the torpedoes makes a note of how many, the target ship, and what his guess is to as to the maneuvering of the target ship over the next movement.  This represents the guess work that goes into leading the ship when firing, so that the torpedoes are on target.  If the player guesses right (his guesses are - Stay Straight, Move port, Move starboard, or Move Reverse - based on the location and bearing of the target ship when the torpedoes are launched), then there is a chance for torpedoes to strike.The procedure is, if the torpedo run is on target, note the number of torpedoes, and based on some modifiers, roll a dice to see how many actually strike the target (there are modifiers for speed and range and some situational conditions).  Again, there is art (guessing the move of the target vessel) and science (determining how many fish strike home).  The rules also allow you to select a depth of run for the torpedo - which means that they will strike more effectively against some targets, but may pass underneath others.Torpedo tablesOnce you know how many torpedoes hit, for each one, roll on the Torpedo effect table, to see how many Hull/Armament boxes are lost, whether there is a Critical Hit, and/or whether or not the target ship is simply sunk.  It is all based on the DF (defensive factor) of the target ship.  Large ships are harder to damage with torpedoes.  Note the same procedure is followed for ships moving through minefields.SubmarinesSubmarines have the ability to launch torpedo attacks.  There are rules for moving the submarine on the surface, and also what happens when a submarine finds a task force.  They really work much better in a campaign, but it is possible to include them in a set piece surface scenario.Spotted submarines (either before or during the attack) can then be attacked by escorts, etc.  Surviving submarines can launch torpedo attacks.AircraftAircraft can fly several missions (search, CAP, bomb, torpedo, etc).  There are rules for launching and recovering float planes (used for spotting), and for carrier and land base operations.Once strike aircraft find their target ship (usually this takes place in a campaign setting), then they are able to make an attack.  They first must survive attack by the defending CAP aircraft that might be patrolling.  There is a simple chart where the number of attacking aircraft roll a dice to see how many enemy aircraft are destroyed, or must return to base.  The same procedure happens with A/A fire.  Surviving aircraft then then roll on a bombing or torpedo run chart to see if any of their deadly payloads hit, and (based on the DF of the target vessel) how much damage is done.These operations are very simple, but very sensible.  Knowing how many bombers and how many fighters to include in a mission becomes more of an art, because the science of adjudication is kept so simple.  Again, this is a subsystem of the rules that works very well.  It does require some record keeping - how many aircraft are on the carrier, what types are they, are they ready to launch, or arming.  When a mission is launched, what is the composition (4 fighters, 8 bombers, for instance).  But it is all pretty simple.Additional RulesThere are rules covering minefields (and the laying/sweeping of same), motor torpedo boats, weather, logistics (including endurance of ships, and resupply), and so on.  For a little 5x8\" book, there is a surprisingly comprehensive coverage of WW2 naval operations.While a lot of this detail, and the extra weapons systems and situation rules, can be used in set piece battles and/or scenarios devised by a referee or based on history, the real strength of these rules shines in campaign play.Campaign PlayThe book gives two types of campaigns.  The full scale map campaign (that will cover weeks, if not years, of campaign time), and the mini campaign (that covers hours, and/or days of campaign time).  The former will have full blown naval operations, including long range planning, movement, logistics, and missions.  The latter will focus mostly on search operations, leading to surface engagements.  Again, the systems (such as endurance, map speed, air operations in searching, spotting enemy units, etc) are very straight forward, but this is where the gameplay shines.  And because surface engagements are so easy and fast to set up and adjudicate, the campaign works well, and is not bogged down by large tabletop affairs.Thoughts, ConclusionWhile I have an immense amount of respect, and fond memories, for all the games of Seekrieg I played (and I truly appreciate the herculean amounts of research that have gone into those rules), I really enjoy playing General Quarters.  There is a second book, GQ2, that covers (extensively) WW1 operations - including the vagaries of WW1 ship design (wing turrets?), and things like the difference between coal ships and oil ships in campaigns, plus airships.  But GQ2 also has more campaign rules, and additional rules for WW2 - including a more nuanced straddle table (and critical hit system) based on using a D10 instead of a D6.  To be honest, I like the purity of GQ1 - mostly because I like rolling D6s, and because it works.Campaigns in this system really do work well, and I have fond memories of some one day map campaigns I ran, while living in South Carolina, at a monthly wargame club meeting.  We used maps from the Columbia Games Victory series, and there were two sides the British navy and the Japanese navy.  Both sides had goals and missions, and there was hidden asset map movement.  Both sides were trying to land troops and supplies at some islands in an atoll, and both controlled airbases in the areas - Japan had, for instance, the island of Palikai, while the British had a naval base inside Mina Bay - see the map below.  Things like fishing vessels would trigger false reports of enemy ships, and air operations were a lot of fun, when things like two float planes firing at each other (presumably with flare pistols?).  The Japanese players loved their submarines.Map used for 1 day mini-campaign. Based on extra maps for VictoryThe rules are simple and clean, but still preserve a lot of detail about the difference between ship classes, weapon systems, and resulting tactics.  I have seen some more modern rulesets that are even less complex, but I like GQ.  The new versions, put out by ODGW, are fantastic, and truly excellent examples of fine wargame rules, but I think I still like GQ1 (and 2)."},
{"title": "Seekrieg Fourth Edition - review", "date": "Tuesday, January 24, 2017", "text": "This is another review in the Once and Future Rules series, of wargame rules that are out of print, but that got a lot of play at one time (at least, in the clubs and groups I played in since the early 1980s).I should preface this review by stating that I was very much interested in Naval Wargaming from early days.  While in high school, while I was threading my way through medieval wargaming and miniatures in general (and playing lots of boardgames, of the Avalon Hill and SPI varieties), I was luck enough to have at the local library, copies of the Barry Carter, Paul Dunn, and Paul Hague books that introduced naval wargaming.  I never (back then) saw the Featherstone one.  I also was a big fan of War at Sea from Avalon Hill.  In high school, I wrote my own set of WW2 naval wargame rules based on War at Sea, and a little book on the ships of WW2 (which gave speeds and ranges), and the Hague book.  It was great fun, and we played on a ping pong table.  But, as rules go, they were awful.  And we didn't have miniatures - we used paper cutouts of photocopies of silhouettes.  But it was a start down the road of Naval Wargming.  I wrote a history of the hobby for the Old Dominion Military Society blog.This is a review of the fourth edition of Seekrieg, which was released in 1981 (I first came to the game, and played it, in the late springtime of 1984).  Seekrieg (the original) was printed in 1975, and went through a lot of revision, very quickly, to get to 1981.  These are a set of comprehensive naval battle rules, including rules covering ships and technologies from approximately 1890 up until the end of WW2 (1945).  The game has rules covering almost all tactical operations in surface engagements for that time period, plus air operations, and strategic games (map campaigns, searching, etc).  Written by Richard Sartore and Jack Joyner, they were published by Sartore.  The game was recreated/updated in 2004, as Seekrieg 5, which is still available for purchase.  Seekrieg 4 is available, graciously, for free download (a bunch of files, as you'll appreciate from below), on the Seekrieg website.The set of the rules that I own is the second printing, which came out in 1984.  At the time, they were released in a handsome dark blue linen covered box, with a line drawing of a battleship on the front cover, and it contained two hole punched books, and a sheaf of charts on cardstock.  The two books were (1) the rulebook, and (2) the ship data book.  The ship data book covered the ships for the period in question (1890-1945) for the world's navies, but did not cover variants or conjectured ships that were either never laid down, or never launched.  There was supposed to be a volume 2 of the ship data book, covering such alternative vessels, but to my knowledge it was never produced.The Box, picture from Boardgame GeekBefore I get into the various subsystems of the game, let me say up front that I played a lot of Seekrieg.  Lots of surface actions, campaigns, tournaments - both as a player and as a referee.  It is a very satisfying game, for the naval gamer that thrives on detail - which is de rigueur for rulesets of the 1980s.  But, internally, the rules themselves presented a bit of a conundrum (in design philosophy), which I will cover in my remarks at the end of the review.The many charts included in the gameScale 1 model ship represents one actual ship (this applies to boats, submarines, ships, etc).  Aircraft are frequently marked by a single marker for a squadron of planes.   Torpedoes are marked by a single marker for a salvo.  The surface scale of the table doesn't matter, however as all ranges in the game are given in (thousands of) yards, and speeds are given in knots.  With a turn/time scale of 2 minutes to a turn, and  the suggested surface scale of 2\" to 1000 yards, that means 2 knots of speed is 1/4\".  So a ship moving a stately 12kts, will cover a total of 1.5\" in a turn.  A speedier vessel moving at 30kts, will be moving at 3.75\".  Movement measuring sticks, marked out in knots, proved invaluable.Turn Sequence The turn sequence for Seekrieg is very simple - all movement and firing is simultaneous.  It is suggested that the physical moving of the miniatures on the tabletop be alternated each turn, to see who goes first, but since this has (usually) only minor impact on the decisions an opponent will make that turn, it doesn't matter too much.Movement As mentioned above, the movement is in knots per turn.  There are rates of acceleration and deceleration given, as well as rates of turning for ships (defined below).  The speed of all vessels is listed in a ship listing in the volume of ship data.  For maneuvering, a ship is allowed to turn up to 180 degrees in a turn.  Alternatively, if a ship has slowed to 0kts, it can then move in reverse.  But when a ship is actually turning, it has it's total allowable move (for it's allowable speed for this turn) divided up into legs, that will include turns of 45 degrees.  So if a ship wants to turn a total of 90 degrees, it's move will be divided up into 3 legs.  Move one leg; turn 45 degrees; move the second leg; turn another 45 degrees; and move the third leg.  Simple, and it does not require turning gauges, etc.  On chart B there is a nice set of movement measuring sticks for the suggested scale (of 2\" = 1000 yards).Target BearingSpotting and line of sight Line of sight is a simple affair of a line between the firing ship and the target ship.  If another vessel is in between the two, it only blocks if it is as large, or larger, than the target ship.  This is determined by looking at the standard measure in the game reflecting vessel size - DP.DP stands for Damage Points, and is calculated by multiplying the basic tonnage of a vessel by 0.033.  This is the total number of Damage Points that a ship has, once those are destroyed (by gunfire or torpedoes, for instance) then the ship is destroyed (possibly sinking).Weather There are (based on different sea zones around the world) a set of weather tables on chart B.  These will modify the distance at which you can spot another vessel.  This is based on the DP of the target vessel, the DP of the spotting vessel and is detailed on chart C. The reason that the spotting vessel size is involved, is because it is a general indicator as to how high up above the surface of the sea the spotting control center is located - it makes a difference, when you are trying to spot an enemy vessel at the limits of the horizon (based on the curvature of the earth).  All this is reduced to a simple spotter vs. spotting table on chart C, and gives the max visibility in thousands of yards (which then translates into inches on the tabletop).Hit Determination Here we get to one of the more interesting sequences of Seekrieg, at least for me (since I am a surface gunnery fan of Naval Warfare - torpedoes and aircraft are fussy things, and I prefer cordite and big shells).  First, it must be determined which of the firing ships' guns may fire.  This is based on the mounting of the gun (what kind of turret, or casemate, it is mounted in) and whether or not those guns can come to bear on the target.  This is based on the real life type of turrets, and also the era they are from.  Wing turrets from WW1 (an ill-conceived design concept) are not as flexible as center line turrets from WW1 or WW2.  Arcs of fire are printed on chart J2.  There are a lot of tables in Seekrieg, a list of them is below.  In a particular game, you will not use nearly all of them, but there are some that you will consult again and again.  Chart J2 is something you will consult once or twice when you are first using a new type of vessel, and then you will remember the arc of fire for that vessel's turrets, or mark them down.Chart H1 - basic \"to hit\" - for landlubbers and other sad dogsNow that the bearing guns are known, next (from the ship details in the ship description volume) consult what type of gun it is, what type of shells can fire, what type of fire control system the firing ship has, the range, rate of fire for the type of gun, and whether or not the target is close enough to allow rapid fire.  Once you have all those details (they are presented, all together, in the ship information block), you can begin consulting the firing tables.Chart H2 - Advanced \"To Hit\" - for old salts and rum culliesThere are three types of hit determination in Seekrieg.  Basic, Advanced, and Range Estimation.  The group I played with almost always (like 99%+) used the Advanced method.  This incorporated the most historical details, but assumed that things like range estimation and salvo adjustment was being done by the fire control center, and gun crews of the vessels.  Some players (notably those of the older style games like Fred Jane's rules, Seapower III, and others) liked playing with range estimation, where you actually estimated the number of inches between you and your target.  Pshah, I say.  Fine for those who like it, but not my cup of tea.The Advanced Hit Table was chart H2.  Basic hit table is chart H1. Best to ignore it, it is for those who are weak, and do not like strong coffee.  However, for the sake of completeness, it is described here.  Range estimation, for those members of religious orders that prefer to purge the soul through pain, can be found on chart H3.The basic (chart H1) to hit method takes into account a positive or negative value for each of seven different categories of modifiers.Target SizeBearing from Target (this is determined using the overlay on Chart F - which is a basic overlay on the target, and the bearing from your firing ship to the target will tell you which bearing you have)Fire Control System (a basic modifier based on the era of the ship)Radar Assisted Fire Control (only for certain navies, and only from 1939 on)Change of Target (if you change targets, you get a -10)Range to Target (close is good, far is bad)Speed of TargetAdd up all those modifiers and you get a basic hit number.  The advanced to hit method (chart H2) works much in the same way, but there are 14 categories, and they have much more detail incorporated into them.Target SizeBearing from Target (3 categories, instead of 2)Is the Firing Ship under Fire?Over Concentration (too many similar shells from different ships on the target)Fire Control System (not only the era, but also the type of Fire Control)Radar Assisted Fire ControlRange to TargetChange of TargetSpeed of TargetSpotter Aircraft (is your spotter up, and sending you targeting information?)Evasive ManeuversSea State (from weather)Smoke ScreensVisibility (again, from weather, but also morning, evening, nighttime)When we played, both players typically had a calculator in front of them, and would punch in the numbers from each category that applied (again, they could be positive or negative), and would result in a hit number.We're just starting.How many Shells Once you have your hit number, determine how many tubes you have that are firing.  For instance, a broadside from the main guns on the Bismarck would mean that all eight of the main guns (which are 15.0\"/47 guns - or in terms of Seekrieg, it is a type D1 gun) could come to bear and fire on a target.  Each gun has a rate of fire of 6 (maximum), but that will be based on range (for, you see, the game only allows you to fire as fast as your fire control teams can see the shells drop, and then adjust fire accordingly), and the max range of the big guns on the Bismarck is 39,600 yards, or a total of 79\" on the tabletop.  All this information is easy to read in the ship information block, and a player would copy it all to a log sheet before a game, so all the data is in one place, and easy to look up during the game.From the range (to see if rapid fire is allowed), and the type of gun, you have a maximum rate of fire.  Say, for the Bismarck, at a decent range of maybe 20,000 yards (well within the maximum range of the big 15\" guns), we consult chart G3, and see that the maximum rate of fire is 3 (even though the guns could theoretically fire at a rate of 6 shells every 2 minutes, the range limits that to 3 shells each so that fire control could observe the fall of the shells, and adjust fire accordingly).  So, multiplying eight guns, times 3 shells, means we are determining a hit chance for a salvo of 24 shells.Looking at chart I, we see that across the top of the chart we find a column corresponding to the hit number we calculated from chart H2 (or H1 for basic, or H3 for range estimation), and then look down the left side of the chart to find the number of shells fired.  The table only goes up to 10 shells, so we will have to consult it a number of times.  For each time consulting the chart, roll the percentile dice once, and it will tell you if (for that part of the salvo) if 1 or more shells hit the target.  At this point, we know that some shells have actually hit the target (or not).Ship Data Block - the actual data block is at the bottomDamage DeterminationThe next part of determining the hit results is in rolling to determine hit location - this is a simple percentile dice roll on chart G1.  This is based on whether or not the shot was short range (less than half maximum for the gun) or long range.  A roll will determine whether the ship was hit at the:DeckSidebeltConTurretSuperstructureIf the target was an aircraft carrier, then the hit locations could be:Flight DeckHangarConIslandSidebeltIn both cases, there is a chance of getting a Dud (a shell that did not explode against the target).Now, we look up the Shell type.  This is found on chart G2, and could be Armor Piercing Capped (APC), Semi Armor Piercing (SAP), Common Rounds (COM), or High Explosive (HE).  This would be allowed to different navies/ships at different eras (historical data).  From that chart, you would get a multiplier to the Penetration Factor, Damage Factor (if you do not penetrate), Damage Factor (if you do penetrate - much higher, of course), and the Probability Chance of a Critical Damage.  Also, there is a chance for Pass Through.  This last represents, against a ship with thin armor, the chance that the shell passes clean through the target vessel without exploding.These factors are then used as multipliers for the numbers found on charts R1 or R2.  These are the Range/Penetration/Damage chart.  Chart R1 is the average penetration chart, which averages (based on range, and types of shell fall) both the Vertical (or plunging) fire and Horizontal fire.  Chart R2 gives the specific penetration values for either, based on which type of fire you are doing (plunging or horizontal).  Guess which table we used - of course!  R2.  Using penetration averaging was considered a sign of weakness, and anyone suggesting it was driven from the Naval Wargaming tribe.The chart also gave the basic damage factor.  These numbers would be multiplied by the factors that were looked up on chart G2, based on the type of shell fired.   So you would end up with an Actual penetration value.  Then, based on your hit location, and the armor of the target ship at that hit location (from the ship information block), you would know if your shells actually penetrated, or only impacted on the surface.  In either case, you would use the appropriate damage multiplier times the basic damage value of the shell, and you would know how much DP to subtract from the target vessel for each shell.  You would do this (hit location, and penetration/damage calculation for each shell that hits the target).Each shell would have a chance for a Critical Damage.  These would be rolled up based on chart N1 (for basic surface vessels) or N2 (for aircraft carriers), to see what the particular critical hit you scored, was.  Then you would look that up in the table, and find out that you (for instance) shot off a searchlight, or (for instance) flooded a magazine, or (for instance) destroyed a whole turret or gun mount.  This was where the interesting parts of damage came into play.Damaging ShipsSubtracting DP from a ship has the effect of slowly degrading it's performance.  The ship information tells you, for each subsystem (speed, reflecting the engine rooms, and each type of gun or torpedo tube), how many you lose for each multiple of DP that the ship takes.  For instance.  The Bismarck has a total of 1,386 DP.  Once those are gone, the ship is ineffective, or sinking.  However, for each of the eight 15\" guns, one is lost for every 173 DP that the ship takes.  Also, every 92 DP the ship takes means the ship's speed is reduced (from a maximum of 30kts) down by 2kts.  So as the ship takes damage, it loses (proportionately) guns and speed.There are rules for fires, damage control, and several other aspects of the ship taking damage.Extra RulesThere is a whole section on Air Operations, which I won't cover here.  But it is to the same level of detail as we see above in gunfire.  Also Torpedoes.  And there are rules for Evasive Maneuvers, Smoke Screens, loss of Radar, and other situations.  It is possible for a ship's crew to fail morale and surrender or leave the vessel.ThoughtsNaval wargaming is often a mathematical affair.  This is good, and it appeals to certain players quite a bit.  Seekrieg certainly satisfies in this area.  As you can see, there is a great deal of detail that goes into determining if a hit is scored, how many shells strike, where they strike, the damage they do (based on shell type, hardness of armor, hit location, class of target vessel, etc etc etc).  This is a great system, and very detailed.I mentioned earlier, there is (to me) a conundrum in Seekrieg.  And that is, that some areas are very well detailed, and some are glossed over.  In the rulebook it freely admits that different fire control systems should have been detailed separately, but this is beyond the scope of the game.  Really?  A factor for fire control couldn't be listed for each ship class?  This seems like a trivial thing, and could be based on historical performance of the ships as much as the other researched datum for each vessel was based on.Similarly, the simple (but effective) DP system for determining damage to ships.  No modifier for different types of defensive structure and architecture?  A compartmented hull built in 1935 sinks at the same rate as a hull built in 1890?  Again, this is something that would add some great detail to the amount of research that was done, but could have been (like fire control) a modifier base don era.In the end, the lack of these things does not matter, for the game plays well, gives good results, and satisfies the naval historian/wargamer who wants to know the difference in behavior between different ship classes, and how best he can make the operational decisions to operate a ship or squadron against the enemy.  For it's day Seekrieg was a fantastic ruleset, and it still has many fans.  I love it, but I don't know who I would get to play it these days.This is the first set of Naval rules I am reviewing as part of this series, and I played the game a lot in the 1980s.  Probably my last frequent play of the game was in 1989 or so, after playing it a lot over a period of 5-6 years - totaling a few dozen games each year, maybe more (and campaigns, and tournaments).  But I changed over, during that time, to another system (that I will also review) - General Quarters.  I will draw comparisons between the two styles of game, when I write that review."},

{"title": "War Cry - a review", "date": "Thursday, January 19, 2017", "text": "This is another review in the Once and Future Rules series, of wargame rules that are out of print, but that got a lot of play at one time (at least, in the clubs and groups I played in since the early 1980s).This review will be of War Cry, from Judgest Guild.  But first, a short description of why I am reviewing this ruleset, and why it means so much to me.The rules, in shrinkwrap - old copies are still aroundWhy War Cry? - A reminiscence My first exposure to miniature wargaming was through the purchase in the spring of 1980 of the Hinchliffe Guide to Wargaming (of which there is a complete scan available on the most excellent  Vintage Wargaming blog).  I had the version produced by Heritage in the US, with the color cover showing a wonderfully painted vignette of British redcoats fighting hand-to-hand with some inspired looking Zulu warriors.  The booklet had an overview of the miniature wargaming hobby (which I instantly fell in love with), and offered tips on building terrain, painting miniatures, setting up a table, and offered two sets of rules.  One was a set of rules for Napoleonic battles, and the other was a one page set of Medieval skirmish rules by John Sharples (also available at Vintage Wargaming).  I immediately began collecting Airfix figures from their Battle of Waterloo set, and wanted to try the Napoleonic rules.But, alas, I had no opponent.  My brothers, and some friends, however, were keen to try medieval skirmish, so off we went.  The idea of bigger armies and bigger battles, however, appealed to me.  I found a few packs of 15mm Minifigs models from their Rome and the Barbarians line.  I purchased some and painted them, but they sat with my other early collection of random wargaming figures.Fast forward a few years, to when I started hanging out in the Campaign Headquarters hobby shop in my first year of college (it was 1984).  I joined in with a group of guys who were going to play a large game of 15mm ancients.  The armies were fantastic - mostly they were the Minifigs figures I loved but never played with.  I still have extremely fond memories and feeling for those lines of figures, and that style of army building.  Almost every figure in a unit was identical.  Occasionally, there might be extra command figures (like for the Romans pictured above).  Regular units were all painted identically, but irregular units (barbarians, skirmishers, etc) had different color cloaks and shields, etc. It was all glorious and beautiful.  We set up a very dense pair of battle lines on a 12' long table, and began playing.The armies were something-something-Late-Roman vs. something-something-Gothic.  It was sort of a blur, because the guys setting up the game all brought their figures, and we made up (sort of) armies for the occasion.  The rules used were War Cry.  This was the second edition of the rules, published in 1981 (I own both versions, although my 2nd edition copy is in much better shape).  This version of the rules had all the charts of the game printed on two \"Giant Wall Charts\" (as described on the cover of the rules).  They were 22\"x34\" posters, with all the charts of the game reproduced in large print.  We had several sets of them proudly tacked to the walls of the wargaming room, where everyone could see them during the game.  I was hooked, and thus began a lifelong love for 15mm ancients wargaming.  For that reason, I felt that my series on out-of-print miniature rules would not be complete without a review of War Cry.War Cry - the rulesWar Cry is a set of rules for fighting tabletop battles for armies of the ancient period, up through the medieval period.  Just about anything from the earliest armies of the ancient near east, up through just before the Renaissance is covered.  These were written by Dave Petrowsky (with credit also given to Jim Allen), and published by Judges Guild.  Like most Judges Guild products, which 90% of were roleplaying adventures and supplements, these were printed on inexpensive paper, just a grade or two above newsprint.  The first edition (published 1978, and called \"War Cry and Battle Lust\") was printed in mostly black and white, with some red ink embellishments.  The second edition had a color cover and a few color pictures in the interior.Picture from Boardgame GeekAs mentioned, the charts were printed on poster sized paper, and are double sided.  The rules come with two such posters, so you can mount them on the wall during a game.  The rules themselves are pretty much complete, covering turn sequence, moving, shooting, fighting, morale, and some optional rules including topics such as ships, bombardment of fortifications, and so on.Table of ContentsGame Scale Sequence of Play Orders Movement Terrain Reaction Moves Evading Troops Missile Fire Arcs of Fire Artillery Melee Combat Chariots Cavalry Melee Rules and Chariot Melee Rules Elephant Rules Point Values Regular and Irregular Troops Fortifications Melee Weapons Disarray Overlapping Morale Morale Charts Percentage Loss Table Organizing Your Army Army Morale Chart Battering with Artillery Assault on Fortifications Optional Rules Questions and AnswersThe game is suitable for 15mm and 25mm figures, and gives basing for both (it uses standard WRG basing sizes).  The standard troop types from WRG are also mentioned, and mostly relied on in the rules.  In fact, it has been remarked that War Cry is a cleaned and simplified version of pre-5th edition WRG (maybe an amalgam of 3rd or 4th, but with some different systems in the rules).Turn Sequence and OrdersThe sequence of play is as follows:Phase I: Order writing (more on this later)Phase II: Movement - two subphases, first are charge declarations (which might trigger certain orders or reactions), and then all movement (both sides, simultaneous, based on orders).  Reaction moves also happen here.Phase III: Missile fire - some occurs during phase II, but most happens nowPhase IV: Melee (anyone in base-to-base contact with the enemy will fight)Phase V: Morale Check phaseOrder Writing - readers of this series of reviews will know that I am not a fan of rulesets that require the players to write orders.  However . . . here it seemed to work.  The game is pretty straight forward, so orders are mostly of the \"unit X will move 8\" oblique to the left\" or \"unit Y will charge the enemy archers\".  I recall playing these rules using simple order markers (like the sort used in Johnny Reb), showing basic move orders (straight, left, right, re-order), or charge.  A simple unit roster with room for each turn could be used, such as the one pictured in the old Hinchliffe guide...Hinchliffe idea for an Order Chart, from Vintage WargamingMoves, Reactions, Evades Movement distances are given on the chart, based on troop type and given in inches for each troop type, for Normal moves, Charge moves, and March Column moves.  These range from 8\" for most formed infantry (Armored Infantry move 6\"), up to as much as 16\" for Light Cavalry.  There is also a chart for how terrain affects movement.  Terrain types listed include:FordRiverWoodsGentle SlopeSteep SlopeAbrupt SlopeEach of these will list a multiplier for that terrain type, vs a unit type.  For instance, Heavy and Armored Infantry are 4x in the woods (meaning that each inch crossed in the woods, takes 4\" off the movement for that unit, for that turn).  The costs for doing formation changes, or turns of 45 degrees, are also given.  The game supports basically a line formation, and a column formation.  Change formation is done with the unit standing in place, and rotating about the center.  Wheeling is done by measuring the outer edge of the wheeling unit.  When a unit is performing a charge, it is at a higher movement value - and the difference between regular move (example: Heavy Infantry 8\") and a charge move (Heavy Infantry 12\") is the amount of the charge move that must be in a straight line (so the last 4\" of a charge move by Heavy Infantry must be in a straight line, although the unit may have turned or wheeled before that point).Reaction moves are a possibility, so that a unit that finds itself being charged, might alter it's ordered movement for the turn, in order to respond to the charging enemy.  The unit must follow it's movement orders for part of the turn (1/4 of the move for regular units, and 1/2 of the move for irregular units) before it can react (such as stand, or turn in place, etc).Light Infantry and Light Cavalry can attempt to evade charging units.  Deep units may not evade at all, and others must pay the penalty for a Front-to-Rear evolution, then move away from the charger.  Pretty straight forward, especially when you check the chart and find that Light Infantry pay no cost to do a front-to-rear change, and Light Cavalry only pay a 3\" penalty (from a regular 16\" move).  So lights can move pretty far away from a charger.  Evaders can also dice (there is a basic chance based on training, and weapon) to see if they can fire before evading.  Firing by an evading unit is at a penalty.Missile FireShooting by units is pretty generous.  Stationary units can fire two ranks deep.  Most moving units can fire one rank deep, but some can fire 1 and a half ranks (the whole first rank, and half the figures from the second rank).  If missile troops are charged, and the chargers move over half their move to reach them, then they missile troops can fire, and also engage in melee.  Orders are not required to fire.  Mounted troops can split move and fire (move, shoot, and move again).  Very nice for mounted archer types like mongols...There is a simple fire priority.  If more than one unit is in your firing arc, and range, you must fire (first choice) at a unit that can reach you for melee next turn.  Next choice would be an enemy missile unit (some restrictions here).  If there is a choice, or no priority targets, the shooter can choose whichever target they like.   Rules for how many missile hits a chariot can take are given.The fire procedure is simple - calculate the number of figures that can fire (this is the number of \"factors\" on the firing chart).  Add or subtract situational modifiers to the number of figures (these are called \"factor modifiers\").  The modifiers to the number of figures is somewhat small (it is usually only -1 or -2 figures, from the total allowed to fire).  Here is a list:Mounted Unit -1 Long Range -2Foot Firing Unit Moved -2Short Range +2 Now, against this, a single dice is rolled, and it has a number of dice modifiers.  Compare the two on the firing chart, and the number of enemy figures killed is given.  Dice modifiers are cumulative, and range from a +2 to a -4 depending on the modifier.  Here is a list:Cataphracts or Plate Armor  -4Other Metal Armor  -2Other Armor  -1Oversized Shield  -1Unshielded  +1Formation 3 or more Ranks Deep  +2Non-Barded Cavalry or Camelry  +1Defender in Light Cover  -2Defender in Dense Cover  -4  Fire at Moving Target   -1So, the resulting dice roll can be modified by these factors, quite a bit.  Usually, there is a modifier for armor, less frequently there are cover modifiers, or a moving target modifier.   Cross matrix the number of figures (\"factors\") vs. the modified dice roll, and you get a number of dead enemy figures.Ranges vary by weapon, from a maximum range of 4\" for a heavy pilum, out to 26\" for longbows, 30\" for heavy crossbows,  and even 48\" for ballistae.Missile fire rules are completed with a section describing how various ancient and medieval artillery works in the rules.  Ballista type weapons, and catapult type weapons are covered.  The former are a simple point and shoot weapon, much like missile fire from a unit.  The latter are handled by the firer announcing a firing range, then dicing for over/under and shot drift.Melee CombatThe rules for melee combat are, at their heart, very similar to missile combat.  You count up the eligible number of figures that can fight (\"factors\"), and then roll 1d6.  To that you add or subtract a number of modifiers, and then matrix the modified dice result with the factors number, to derive a number of enemy figures that are killed.The basic dice modifiers come from a chart that cross-indexes all the troop types of the game, and the result is the first modifier for the dice roll (so for instance, Heavy Infantry fighting against a Medium Chariot is a -1).  The situational modifiers include the following:SituationModifierMed, Hvy, A Inf Charging +1Med Cav Charging +2Hvy Cav Charging +3E Hvy, S Hvy Cav Charging +4Elephant Charging +5Berserkers Charging (1st round) +2SituationModifierUpslope from Opponent +1Opponent has light cover -2Opponent has Dense cover -4Opponent in March Column +2Against Opponent's Flank +5Against Opponent's Rear +7Opponent Shieldless +1SituationModifier2H Chopping Weapon v. M H and A infantry +32H Chopping Weapon v. Cav, Camels, Chariots, Elephants +32H Chopping Weapon v. all others +2Heavy Javelin or Pilum used in 1st Round +1Lance, used in 1st round +1Rules exist for Chariots (they can swerve or crash, when you attempt to charge home with them), Elephants (the can go berserk, and only die after taking a number of \"casualties\").  There are descriptions of how many ranks of troops can fight, based on weapons: for instance, pikes have the whole first rank, and half each of ranks 2 and 3.  Finally, there are rules determining things like Unit Disarray, Overlapping an enemy unit, and break-off moves.MoraleThe Morale system of War Cry is interesting, and I admit to liking it.  Each unit of troops has a starting morale value that is an indicator of it's training, physical courage, determination to fight, etc.  This ranges between 5 (extremely poor quality troops) and  13 (fanatic berserkers).  That number, or less, is rolled against with 2d6 for a morale check.  There are a few modifiers (not many) but one that is always in effect, is that you always get -1 to your morale value for every 10% of casualties that you take.  Considering you don't start taking tests until you are 30% down, you will start your first number as 3 less than your starting value.  So a good quality Roman Praetorian Guard unit is a MV of 11.  When it takes 30% casualties, and has to test morale, it is trying to roll 8 or less.If you roll less than your modified MV, then you pass your morale test.  But if you roll more, then you use your unmodified dice roll to consult a chart and see what the effects are.  The effects chart is structured so that if you roll high, the results aren't too bad, but if you roll low, then they are terrible.  This works well with the overall morale test mechanism, since you only blow your test with a low number, if you have a modified (down) MV.Calculating the 10% of casualties on a unit with 18, 24, or 36 figures can be a pain on the fly, so the rules suggest that you make an army roster, listing each unit, their base MV, along with how many figures they will be once they lost 30%, 50% and maybe 60 or 70%.  With that number, list their modified MV for the new level, so that it is a simple matter of looking up how many figures are remaining in a unit, then you get access to their current MV.Example Morale RosterUnit (Original Size/MV)30%50%60% SizeMV SizeMV SizeMVGreek Heavy Infantry 50/8 355 253 202Creten Archers 20/7 144 102 81Thracian Light Cav 10/6 73 51 40So, looking at the above chart, we see a unit of Creten Archers, that starts the game with 20 figures.  When it gets down to 14 figures, it has taken 30% casualties and it's morale value drops to a 4-.  So if it has to take a morale test (ignoring, for now, any other modifiers), it has to roll 2d6, and score a 4 or less.  If it does not, then it looks at the morale results table to see what happens.Setting up the chart takes some time, before the game, but it makes the game roll very nicely.ExtrasThe rules include a points system, which also covers a Weapons Category system (a figure gets a hand weapon for free, and a weapon from one other category, all others are paid for).  There are guidelines for which historical armies were regular, irregular, or either. There are some short rules for including ships and boats, and how they behave (although, to me, the page with the boat rules looks like it came from another Judges Guild set of rules - \"Sea Steeds and Wave Riders\").  Finally, there is a section of optional rules.  These include pursuits of fleeing units; cohort relief (to emulate the Roman manipular system); Chivalry Honor for knights; caltrops; Normal Cavalry (those Norman horses bite, you know); Poison weapons; the effect of Camels and Elephants on cavalry (smell); Levy troops; the Elephant Graveyard (they respect other dead elephants); and finally Shield Wall and Testudo formations.Thoughts on War CryWar Cry is a nice adaptation of the basic WRG factors and table type system, but without using 20 casualties per figure - all casualty results are given in whole figures, which is nice and runs smoothly.I have some problems with playing it.  As I remember, these where some complaints back in the day, but we ignored them in order to have a simple set of rules that gave good results.Complaint 1: order writing. This could be remedied by having a variant turn sequence.Complaint 2: combat and morale modifiers don't seem to be very well thought out. Just a thought.Complaint 3: there is little reflection of morale grade differences in actual combat, only in the results of combat.  That is pedantic, but it does have an effect.Otherwise it is a nice set of rules.  I have great memories of playing, with some of my best friends from college and my early wargaming years.  Sadly some of them have passed away since then (and my attendant melancholy which might add to my fondness of those games, I admit).  But it is a good adaption of the WRG system, and plays quickly.  It gives pretty good results, and some of the \"chrome\" rules (chariots, elephants) make it a lot of fun to play.The rules in the game are clearly meant for 25mm figures, and the ground scale is given absent a figure scale (1 inch equals 10 yeards).  But the basing chart gives base sizes for 15mm and 25mm.  As I mentioned, way back in the 80s, we played these (out of the box, so to speak) with 15mm figures, with no modification to the ranges.  I think that still works, but a 15mm cavalry unit moving over 20 inches in a turn is a bit much for a small table.  Good thing my is 6'x10'. We used it for some basic fantasy type wargaming as well (I recall a game of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, where the Oliphants made it up siege ramps to the top of the outer walls of Minas Tirith, then 1 of the beasts went berserk and ran down the whole length of the wall).  Since it was sold by Judges Guild, a company known for their support of fantasy roleplaying games, I am sure that many other groups did the same thing.These days, I don't know how I would rank these rules against some of my other older favorites for the period (such as Might of Arms, Chainmail, Universal Soldier or others).  I think I might try a game of it soon, with a modified turn sequence that would support Solitaire play."},

{"title": "The Thanksgiving That Was", "date": "Tuesday, November 29, 2016", "text": "Thanksgiving was celebrated with great joy and thankfulness at GwCHQ (i.e. - our family home).  We had plenty of feasting, and a good friend spent the weekend with us (rather than at home, alone) and we had a parcel of other friends join us on Saturday for a game day.  There was supposed to be (perhaps) an RPG session - never happened.  There was supposed to be some miniatures gaming (Frostgrave, Chainmail, and maybe Lion Rampant) - also never happened.  Did that pose a problem?  No, we had a great time anyway!The guy in the hat kept asking about King of TokyoWe played a number of board games over the weekend (standard fare - Dominion, Catan, Lanterns, Ticket to Ride, etc), and we played a bunch of Legends of Andor.  Fun game, and it really scratched that \"we would like to play an RPG but can't get the whole band together\" sort of desire to go adventuring, fight monsters, and complete quests.  I don't know what the German version of the game is like (published by Kosmos), but the version we have (the Fantasy Flight English version from 2012) was fantastic.  One of the best things about the game was that artist Michael Menzel (who paints really stunning maps and images used in a lot of boardgames) was also the game designer.Board showing the above ground map of Andor (reverse shows below ground)The basic mechanic is one of using time slices to perform tasks (usually movement and combat against monsters).  This is very similar to the mechanic used in a lot of other games, but immediately Tinner's Trail and (to a lesser extent) Thebes spring to mind.  Also, the many Kramer boardgames that use action points to limit your moves.  But in the other examples, and in Legends of Andor, everyone is doing their actions interspersed, instead of the whole pool of action points all at one time.  Very clever, really gives a feel for doing your actions during a day of adventuring, and it makes the game flow well, and introduce some nice decision making for the players.To end this recap on gaming over Thanksgiving, I thought I would share a few other game boards that were painted by the talented Mr. Menzel.  Below are boards for Pillars of the Earth, Stone Age, and Castle for all Seasons.  Other than each of them being stunningly beautiful abstract landscapes (showing the country side, and other features important for the game, but illustrating scenes of local activity and inhabitants, albeit out of scale to the countryside), are all also very informative and intuitive in indicating play areas, and active spots, on the board/map.Pillars of the Earth Stone AgeA Castle for All SeasonsSo it was a lovely Thanksgiving - with Family, Feasting, Friends, and a bit of Faith.  The year has been very good to us, and we had a great time forgetting about our toils and jobs and school and cares for a while, and enjoying each others company over a gaming table (also, plenty of pie and coffee helped).  Now, on to Christmas!"},

{"title": "Koenig Krieg - review", "date": "Thursday, November 17, 2016", "text": "This is another review in the Once and Future Rules series, of wargame rules that are out of print, but that got a lot of play at one time (at least, in the clubs and groups I played in since the early 1980s).This review is a little bit different from some of the others, in that KK is a ruleset that is currently available, so it is not out of print (a great review by Mark Severin at Deep Fried Happy Mice makes a good read).  It is, however, in a very different format from the wonderful set by Barry Gray that I bought back in the mid 80s for about $3 or 4.The version I have, (actually I have two versions, the one from 1982, and the one from 1986) does not have much information in it, as to publishing info, etc.  There is a cover page that mentions Barry Gray by name, and inside the back cover, there is an advert for Mike's Models. The advert mentions Austrians and Prussians, and offers them at $4.50 for 18 figures (or 9 cavalry).  The good old days.Admittedly, in the 1980s, I was not too interested in the Seven Years War in Europe, but I was interested in the North American portion (the French and Indian War), and also the American War for Independence.  It was with that in mind that I first approached the rules.  Later I would become a fan of Seven Years War era warfare, in Europe, and learning more of the history went arm-in-arm with the wargaming.So what is KK like?  First, it uses rectangle elements for basing the infantry, with 4 figures on a base, 2 each in 2 different ranks.  Other than Johnny Reb, from Adventure Gaming, I do not recall other rule sets using similar basing at that time (that would all change, with the advent of Napoleon's Battles...).  Cavalry and Artillery were mounted much like many other rulesets.  But it wasn't the basing that made (and still makes) KK a good ruleset.  It was the turn sequence.The turn sequence has five phases in it, which the players execute through in order, and roughly simultaneously, each turn.  I say roughly simultaneously, because while each side will do their part of a phase before progressing to the next, within each phase where order matters, the two sides will determine initiative through an initiative test.  Here are the phases:Command PhaseMovement/Fire PhaseClose Combat PhaseMelee PhaseExploitation Phase Going through these is a great way to explain KK.The Command phase This is when you check to see which units will be \"in command\" or \"out of command\" during the turn.  Any units out of command will have to dice to see if they can act during the other phases - Infantry will only act on a 1-2 (on a d6), and Cavalry (being more independent?) can act on a 1-4.  Out of command units can always fire, but cannot change formation or facing (even if it can move)The Movement/Fire Phase This is when units (you guessed it) move and fire.  This is done by alternating Brigades.  The Phase starts with determining Initiative.  The player with initiative activates the units within a brigade, then it passes to the other player, etc.Now is a good time to bring up Operations (OP).  Each type of unit has a number of operations that it can use during each of the Three Main Phases (Move/Fire, Close Combat, and Exploitation).  If a unit is Moving, it simply decides how many of its OP for this phase to put towards movement. Each one generates 4\" of movement.  An OP also allows for a formation change, or a backstep (of 1\").  Cavalry, of course, have more operations than Infantry, especially in the Move/Fire phase, so can move further.  Depending on current formation, etc, some units have a +1\" modifier, that they might use to add to the total move they will get (for instance, Foot Artillery has 1 OP in the Move/Fire Phase, but it also has +1\" - so whatever else it does, it can also move a bonus of 1\";  Horse Artillery is the same, but with 2 operation points, and +1\"; etc.).Firing also uses an OP.  So, Infantry in Line, has 1 OP in the Move/Fire phase.  That means it can move 4\", or it can Fire.  It cannot do both. This is what gives the game it's very nice feel for Linear Warfare of this period.  You can extend a unit out by moving it away from it's friends, but it won't be able to do much, quickly, on it's own - so you better be supported.Special Rules for strategic moves for units well away from the front exist, as well as rules for retreat moves (which don't require an operation point).Firing is done during this phase, and is adjudicated by determining the number of dice per figure (roughly, 1 dice per two infantry firing; or 1 dice per artillery crew firing).  The chance to hit (on each d6 rolled) is based on a Fire Table, and is typically a 5+ or a 6, but in some cases can be as generous as a 3+ or 4+.Losses are marked with casualty caps, and when a stand has accumulated enough, it is removed from the unit.So to recap, the available OP a unit has in the Move/Fire phase can be used in the following way:Move 4\" (except Infantry in Square)Change facing/formationFire (except cavalry)Backstep 1\"All very reasonable, which is suitable for warfare in this Age of Reason.The Close Combat Phase The next phase is the Close Combat phase, which allows for charges, in certain situations, that will result in melee combats.   Again, the phase starts with determining Initiative. Then alternate Brigades. Units that are within 2\" of the enemy may activate during this phase.  Again, each unit has a certain number of OP.  The allowable ways to spend OP in this phase are as follows;Skirmishers (only) can move 4\"Any unit may Change Formation or FacingInfantry can charge an enemy within 1\"Cavalry can charge an enemy within 2\"Infantry and Artillery can fire at a unit charging themCavalry can counter-charge a unit charging them.Each of these costs 1 OP.The Melee PhaseThe next phase is to determine the outcome of Melee Combats that resulted from charges and contacts made in the previous phase.Melee combat is done by adding a dice roll to the morale of the unit involved.  This produces a melee total for that side.  Then both sides are compared, and the lower total loses the difference in casualties.  If there are multiple units involved, then the average morale is used, but each unit gets to roll a dice to add to the total.  There are, of course, situational modifiers.  The losing side then retreats, and if the winner was the unit that charged, the loser loses another figure.  If the melee totals were a tie, then both sides lose a figure, and all units involved have to make a morale check.  Losers will retreat, if both pass, then fight another round.The Exploitation PhaseUnits that charged, and won a combat, may now execute OP during the Exploitation Phase.  This begins, again, with testing initiative, and then alternates, one brigade at a time.  Of course, only the brigades that have units doing an Exploitation can move this phase.  Infantry and Artillery may fire, even if they did not earn an Exploitation move.  So the actions allowed for OP to be spent on in this phase are:Move 4\" per OP (exploiting units only)Change facing or Change formation (exploiting units only)Infantry and Artillery can fire at a unit charging itCavalry can counter-charge a unit charging themIn this way, a successful charge in the Close Combat Phase, that is resolved successfully in the Melee Phase, can result in an Exploitation Move that generates another combat.  There is a chance for Cavalry to become unhinged (er. uncontrolled - sorry, my infantry bias is showing through).  If so, they begin a charge to glory that might take them off the board, or might take them through any enemy units in the way.There are some rules for morale, army morale, and some optional rules (weather, dragoons, etc).  The beginning of the book has a good section on setting up a table, basing figures, and organizing brigades.  Finally, an appendix has great information on army contents, and information on building armies (how many units, what types, ratio of guns to infantry, etc).A great set of rules - always fun to play, represents the combat of the time nicely, plays quickly, and has an easy set of rule systems.  As I mentioned I played these first with AWI armies, so we didn't have a lot of cavalry - which really cuts down on things like exploitation and charges, and focuses on fire combat.  So when I first played a large Seven Years War battle, it was like *Something Wonderful* had occurred, and the game took on a whole new dimension.  And it never even required me to get some sort of thing about flutes.KK is fun, and I still like it.  It, to me, was always much more fun to play than Warfare in the Age of Reason, but maybe a bit less specific.  I'll take fun over specific."},

{"title": "Lord of the Manor - Sample Army - Bombastia", "date": "Saturday, November 12, 2016", "text": "(This is a continuation of my thoughts about a mapless Medieval campaign supporting tactical medieval rules, such as Chainmail.  This is the first version of the random generation of lands and troops.)This is a partner article to the one on the army of Poppenheim.   As mentioned previously, Bombastia is the other medieval state that was part of pre-modern Furstenberg. It was often at war with Poppenheim, even into the early modern period, when the 1696 Crisis of the Pumpkin-King Throne between the Principality of Bombastia and the Grand Duchy of Poppenheim would lead to the Unification Wars of Furstenberg (ending up establishing the modern state of Furstenberg).  But, as early as the 11th century, and on up until the 18th, the two states were often at war with each other.So, relying on the Lord of the Manor system, lets take a look at what the medieval state of Bombastia looked like, and what the army looked like.First, the chief Manor of Bombastia is at Hofbrau Burg, and the ancestral feudal duty of the Hofbrauen means that the army of Bombastia starts out with a unit of Knights and a unit of Crossbow.Hofbrau BergThe other lands that make up the Demesne of Bombastia are as follows:Four farmlands, which the player chooses to provide 3 Spearman units, and 1 unit of mounted Sergeants.Two forests, which the player chooses to provide 2 units of Archers.One town, which provides 1 unit of Billmen, and 100 bezants.One Church, which the player decides to tithe 100 bezants, and gains the use of 1 unit of Holy Order Knights.Two Highlands, which the player chooses to provide 1 unit of Highland Pike, and 1 unit of Reivers.One Orchard, which provides the player with 1 unit of Men at Arms, and 100 bezants.This means that the army of the Demesne of Bombastia consists of:1 unit of Knights (9 figures, heavy horse, lance)1 unit of Holy Order Knights (9 figures, heavy horse, lance) 1 unit of Sergeants (9 figures, medium horse)1 unit of Reivers (9 figures, medium horse, lance)3 units of Spearmen (18 figures, heavy foot)1 unit of Billmen (18 figures, heavy foot, polearms)1 unit of Men at Arms (18 figures, armored foot)1 unit of Highland Pike (18 figures, light infantry, pike)2 units of Archers (12 figures, light infantry, long bow)1 unit of Crossbowmen (18 figures, light infantry, crossbow)And the player has access to 200 bezants, but spends 100 of it to secure the unit of Holy Order Knights, from the local Church.This is a very good army, but the player might be eager to either conquer the Towns or the Port that the Poppenheim player has, to balance out the money situation - very lopsided, at 600 bezants (Poppenheim) to only 200 bezants (Bombastia).(This is a continuation of my thoughts about a mapless Medieval campaign supporting tactical medieval rules, such as Chainmail.  This is the first version of the random generation of lands and troops.)In the past, some of my wargaming with Imaginary Nations (or Imagi-Nations) has featured a number of substates and states in a fictional region called Balkania.  In 19th and 20th century conflicts, I have used the two states of Furstenberg and Rumpwhistle.  Earlier conflicts have been between the two medieval states of Poppenheim and Bombastia (they were baronial lands that became part of Furstenberg).Here is the treatment that a medieval Poppenheim receives, when using the Lord of the Manor method to determine the army. So, the demesne of Poppenheim has 12 lands. The first is automatic (a Manor), the other 11 were generated using the dice method presented in the earlier article.First is the Manor, which we will call Schloss Romfels, and is the seat of Poppenheim power. It provides two units to the army, a unit of Crossbowmen, and a unit of Knights.Schloss RomfelsThree Farmlands, which the player chooses to provide 2 units of Spearmen, and 1 unit of mounted Sergeants.One Forest, which the player chooses to provide one unit of ArchersOne Pasture, which the player chooses to provide one unit of Slingers, and 100 bezants.Two Towns, which provides 2 units of Billmen, and 200 bezants.One Port, which provides 200 bezants, and access to hire Foreign Mercenaries.Two Highlands, which the player chooses to be 2 units of Highland Pike units.One Fish Pond, which provide 1 unit of mounted Men at Arms, and 100 bezants.  This gives a family consisting of:1 unit of Knights (9 figures, heavy horse, lance)1 unit of mounted Men at Arms (9 figures, heavy horse)1 unit of mounted Sergeants (9 figures, medium horse)2 units of Spearmen (each, 18 figures, heavy infantry)2 units of Billmen (each, 18 figures, heavy infantry, polearms)2 units of Highland Pike (each, 18 figures, light infantry, pike)1 unit of Archers (12 figures, light infantry, longbow)1 unit of Slingers (12 figures, light infantry, sling)1 unit of Crossbowmen (18 figures, light infantry, crossbow) And the player has access to 600 bezants, and has access to hiring Foreign Mercenaries.This is a very interesting army, and should provide a lot of interest to the player who is commanding it.  There is a lot of strong infantry, although the Highland Pike are going to be tough to manage (they hit very hard, and might be a terror, if the enemy army lacks any pike units - but they are light infantry, and would be susceptible to flank attack, and archery)."},
{"title": "Lord of the Manor - Lands and Troops", "date": "Friday, November 11, 2016", "text": "(This is a continuation of my thoughts about a mapless Medieval campaign supporting tactical medieval rules, such as Chainmail.  This is the first version of the random generation of lands and troops.)The Player represents the Lord of a Manor, which owns a Demesne.  At the center, of course, is his Manor, or Castle.  This provides two military units, A unit of Crossbows (light infantry, 18 figures, crossbow), and a unit of Knights (heavy horse, 9 figures, with lance).So, if we go with this chart for the random determination of lands: 2 - Vineyard 3 - Port 4 - Town 5 - Freeland 6 - Forest 7 - Farm 8 - Pasture 9 - Church10 - Highlands11 - Fish Ponds12 - OrchardsThen the next step is to determine what a Lord will receive for his feudal escheats from each of those types of land.Vineyard - Lands with grape vines, plus wine presses, cellars, and a local population of workers to draw from.  The wine is a valuable trade item, so this land produces not only feudal soldiers (heavy infantry) but also money, from the wine trade.  Provides a unit of Spearmen (heavy infantry, 18 figures), and 100 bezants.Port - This land is along a navigable river, and a trading town has been built up at the spot of a natural mooring spot on the river.  Some money is produced from the trade port, but more importantly, the ability to hire foreign mercenaries is possible, due to the amount of seagoing traffic that comes through here.  Provides 200 bezants.  May hire foreign mercenaries.Town - A sizeable independent town has grown up here, meaning that it supports not only a sizeable market (large enough to service the town, but also the surrounding lands and villages), but also a church, guildhalls, mills and other urban services.  The feudal obligation of the town is met through providing troops drawn from the town population, and the marketplace generates a regular flow of tax money.  Provides a unit of Billmen (heavy infantry, 18 figures, polearms), and 100 bezants.Farm - This is not just a single farm, but farmland representing multiple hides worth of feudal farms and subtenants.  The feudal obligation of all these farms and villages is met in the form of heavy infantry, but also the natural horsemanship of the population means that some mounted soldiers can be classed as sergeants.  Provides either Spearmen (heavy infantry, 18 figures), or Sergeants (medium horse, 9 figures).Forest - Representing the waste of the demesne, the woodlands provide the serfs with the means of producing charcoal, harvesting firewood, and hunting for small game.  Of course, there are enough villeins and scoundrels lurking along forest roads that a ready supply of archers can be conscripted.  Depending on the area around the forest, it is also possible that some mounted archers can be found, and could be formed into units of hobilars.  Provides either Archers (light infantry, 12 figures, longbow), or Hobilars (medium horse, 9 figures, bow).Pasture - This represents closed lands for the Lord's private flocks of animals.  Open land is found in the farm lands for the serfs to graze their own animals, this is representing husbandry of animals on a large scale.  Local villages supporting the economy of shepherds and drovers will produce feudal troops suitable for light cavalry duty, or as slingers.  There is also some money to be made from the wool trade.  Provides either Slingers (light infantry, 12 figures, sling), or Riders (light horse, 9 figures), and 100 bezants.Highlands - These lands are in hills and mountains with terrain typically too rough for large scale farming or grazing.  The locals are rough independent clans and tribes, that owe fealty but may not provide much for the manor other than occasional military service.  The troops are irregular bands that are useful for scouting and skirmishing, best described as light infantry or mounted raiders.  Provides Highland Infantry (light infantry, 18 figures, Pike; or 12 figures, Bow), or Reivers (medium horse, 9 figures, lance).Orchards - Lands given over to long term agricultural produce, such as fruit and nut trees.  Typically such lands are a sign of a successful Manor, and so the presence indicates that there will likely be more money to provide armored and trained infantry, such as men-at-arms.  Provides one unit of Men at Arms (Armored Foot, 18 figures), and 100 bezants.Fish Ponds - The lands of the Lord of the Manor are all his, including all wild produce (salmon from the rivers, deer from the forests, and so forth).  In order to increase the amount of fish that a Manor produces, fish ponds would be instituted.  Again, this represents a wealthy and vibrant Manor, which would attract scutage from wealthy families aligning themselves with the Lord - such families would produce heavy cavalry, if not knights, so are represented as mounted Men at Arms.  Provides one unit of mounted Men at Arms (Heavy Horse, 9 figures), and 100 bezants.Church -A Manor would typically have several churches on it.  This would include at least one Chapel in the castle and perhaps a small church in each of the peasant villages, towns, and ports.  But when this result is indicated, it means that there is a higher status Church on the lands of the Manor.  These lands, while included within the demesne of the Manor, are actually independent. However, they might have the Knights of a devoted and powerful patron on call for feudal duty, or there might be a chapter house associated with the Church from a religious order of Knights (such as the Templars).  The presence of a Church, therefore, allocates to the Lord of the Manor the use of a unit of Holy Order Knights.  Provides one unit of Religious Order Knights (heavy horse, 9 figures, lance - treat as Religious Order), but only if Church is paid 100 bezants.Money raised from Lands in the Demesne can be used to purchase extra equipment, to hire mercenaries, to pay for Scouts or Spies, to fund Adventures, and of course to tithe to the Church, in order to secure the services of Holy Order Knights.  Details on these will be in a future article.A sample army, for Medieval Poppenheim, is detailed here.A sample army, for Medieval Bombastia, is detailed here."},
{"title": "Overwatch - review", "date": "Wednesday, November 2, 2016", "text": "This is another review in the Once and Future Rules series, of wargame rules that are out of print, but that got a lot of play at one time (at least, in the clubs and groups I played in since the early 1980s).We have severely underestimated the Russians, the extent of the country and the treachery of the climate.  This is the revenge of reality.                   -Heinz GuderianOverwatch was a rule set that was really very popular with the gaming crowd that played at the Campaign Headquarters store on the Virginia Peninsula (the parent store was in Norfolk, but I played at the store that was originally located in Hampton, and later in Newport News, much more frequently).The crew at the store had originally gotten a copy of the 1979 playtest edition of the rules, which they almost immediately migrated to (previously playing a mix of Tractics and Angriffe).  But, the version I own, and the one I played mostly, was the second edition that came out in 1984.These rules, written by Robert Davison, were written with 1/285 (or 1/300) scale miniatures (micro-armor) in mind.  The two earlier sets (Tractics and Angriffe) were written for HO scale miniatures, but could be adapted to micro-armor.  The ground scale is fifty yards to the inch, and the time scale is a minute to a turn.  For our games, which were tank heavy (as the rules tend to also be written for), and extremely tactical (not a lot of off-table assets, and not a lot of off-table maneuver), these rules were perfect for the games we were playing.  Davison chose to focus the rules on the period of 1943-45, which also suited us in our games (many of which were in the terrible latter years of the Eastern Front, as well as during the American campaigns in Italy and France).The turn sequence is a non-simultaneous turn sequence, which works very well, although fire combat execution is done so as to mimic simultaneous action.  The turn is broken up into six phases, although I recall that once we were playing frequently, there was a tendency to slip phases 3/4 and 5/6 together, which is (as I recall) a big mistake and leads to weird outcomes.Move Sequence Determination - dice roll to see who moves first (this is not a choice; if you roll high, you go first)Movement Execution - both sides move, based on the order determined earlier, side A then side BTarget Acquisition and Fire Designation - Using the target designation rules, determine who CAN shoot, and from those, both sides (again, side A first) will announce fire intentions.  This cannot be altered.Fire Execution - All declared shots from the previous phase are not executed.  If you didn't declare a shot, you can't take one now.Reaction Fire Designation - If you did not have a shot declared in phase 3, you could now declare a target.  It is possible, that because of weapons fire, you could see targets now, that you couldn't acquire before.Reaction Fire Execution - All fire designated in phase 5 is now executed.When followed, this leads to pretty good results.  When players get sloppy, and start declaring and executing, all in one swoop, or even before the other player declares, then it gets fuzzy, and the old enemy of simultaneous movement rears it's head here - the argument about \"I would have done that, but now I'm going to do this instead\". . .The rules cover a definition of how movement is handled (it is pretty straightforward and sensible).  Infantry, in a game with 1 minute turns, and 1 inch to 50 yards, does not move fast (1 inch per turn).   But, for our games, this hardly mattered, as we didn't do too much in Overwatch games with infantry, other than crew served weapons (gotta have those AT guns out there, you know).Other rules covered are all the rules for direct fire (arc of fire, line of sight, target acquisition, chance to hit, dice modifiers, results of hit, etc), indirect area fire (artillery), direct area fire (howitzers, etc.), effects on soft targets, tank riders, close assaults, overruns, morale, and a description of the various support weapons (crew served, and man-portable).  Rules exist for weapons such as flame throwers, rockets, and smoke rounds (from regular weapons, and from smoke mortars, etc.).The book gives some useful generic organization notes (sections, platoons, companies, batteries, etc.).C2 is described, but it only really affects calls for indirect area fire missions (artillery).  And the rules are pretty clear, that if a spotter is in radio contact (and he is assumed to be), and the firing battery is available (which it is, unless it is on table and moving), then fire missions arrive in the same turn they are called for.Good rules are presented for terrain and its very specific (tactical) effects on line of sight and target acquisition.But, the bulk of the book is given over to tables.  The first set of tables (Table A through Table H) are tables in support of the rules - things like acquisition, the chance to score a hit, hit location, the effects of HE rounds, and the area of artillery are just some of these.  But the next set of tables are the data tables on equipment.  All of the major combatants of Europe in the period covered (43-45) are present - the Americans, British, Russians and Germans.  Each nationality has a page (or two in the case of the Germans) of information about AFVs.  There is also a page of information about weapons for each nationality (but Americans and British are combined).Finally, some additional equipment tables exist, detailing soft skin vehicles, and the more common artillery pieces. This is followed up by the appendices, which cover a wide variety of additional equipment (less common vehicles and weapons) that are not on the main charts, as well as a section on points values, and finally a discussion on some of the special ammo used in the war (like the American High Velocity Armor Piercing, or HVAP round).There is nothing revolutionary here in these rules, except maybe in how the fire phase is handled.  That, even, is not too unique.  What works is that these rules have a nice simplicity, and they are also appealing to those who like all the detail about their tanks.  For some reason, in the early and mid 80s, we loved this sort of thing (see more discussion on this \"cult of detail\" when I review Seekrieg, later on in this series of articles).  One of the other WW2 rulesets I played and plan to cover, is Angriffe.  It also covers the same spread of data (to almost the same level of detail).  The WRG WW2 rules get away from this, somewhat, by introducing armor class for tanks (in the WRG rules, each AFV is rated a letter, from A to F, for front and side armor, rather than using mm of thickness, as Overwatch and Angriffe do).But what really seemed to work in these rules, is that the model for combat was at the same time very specific, and also abstract enough to move quickly.  It was very specific, in that it covered (mostly) armored warfare in Europe, in the period 1943-45.  Meaning, that most of the rules were covering tank-on-tank action, with some considerations for artillery, and even less for infantry.  On the other hand, this narrow focus allowed a bit of abstraction to creep in.  Most AFVs of the time have a very similar set of physical design features that lend themselves to a generic hit location system (this is an abstraction).  The \"to hit\" roll is based on three things, really - what is the gun class (i.e. - the accuracy of the optics used for targeting the weapon, combined with the inherent accuracy of the weapon itself), whether the target or firer are stationary (or moving), and a modifier for range.  That is it - this makes it simple to represent, but it is an abstraction (what about crew training?  what about visibility?  what about the state of the equipment?).  Finally, weapon effects from direct fire weaponry is an abstraction.  Does the stated penetration of the round you fired, at the range you fired, exceed the listed armor for the vehicle, at the hit location you determined your shot to strike?  If so, then the vehicle is destroyed.Walking through the combat adjudication is a nice way to see the simplicity of the rules.First, table A gives you the knowledge of who you can see. This is based on target class (infantry, artillery vehicles, etc), and is given in yards.Table A - Target Acquisition Next, table B gives you the chance, as described above, of scoring a hit.  This is a percentage value based on a matrix (for each gun class) of whether the shooter or target are moving or stationary.  This is modified by -20% for each (round up) 1000 yards (20 inches).Table B - Hit DeterminationTable C is a 2d6 roll to see where the hit strikes.  This incorporates rules for hull down targets, and also for low-silhouette targets.Table C - Hit LocationTable D gives you the information needed to determine if direct fire HE rounds are effective against a target (firing that big 152mm howitzer might be nasty vs a light tank, but what about vs infantry in a building?).Table D - HE EffectsTable E is a set of tables for determining the effects of machine gun fire.Table E - MG EffectsTable F is a set of charts detailing infantry weapons and their effects.Table F - Small Arms FireTable G is a set of charts for resolving area fire attacks (artillery missions).  It is done by determining the number of weapons, and caliber, and this sums up to an attack factor.  That factor is then matrixed against the target types in the fire mission area (which is detailed on Table H), and a chance for a kill results.Table G - Artillery EffectsThat is it for the rules.  It is driven by the charts, which are very straight forward.  It is a good set of rules, if not brilliant in innovation.  However, for us it worked very, very well.  One of the things that is of interest to the WW2 armor battle wargamer is the interaction of different weapon systems.  By taking a look at (Table P) the Russian weapon data here:Table P - Russian Gun PenetrationAnd (Table L) the German AFV data here (the first half, there are two sheets of German AFVs):Table L - German AFVsWe can see that a round fired by a Russian 76.2mm L41 gun (the weapon on most models of the T-34/76) at about 1000 yards, can penetrate 73mm of armor.  If you compare that to the front upper-hull armor of most German AFVs, you can see that it won't kill a Mk IV F2, G, H, J or any of the big cats (Panther, or either mark of Tiger).  It won't kill a StugIII, or the big Self Propelled Anti-Tank pieces (Elefant, Jagdtiger, etc).  So, if you are firing a T-34/76, you should either be prepared to get a side shot against those German targets, or maybe hope you hit a softer piece of the tank (although the turret is usually worse...).  It is that kind of data that tank nerds (like I used to be, and still devolve into from time to time) really like.Overwatch is a far cry from the abstracted details in a game such as Flames of War, or Blitzkrieg Commander, although I really like BC (mostly for the innovative rules, and the way it incorporates infantry, making the combined arms operation quite important).  And it is very much a different game than Bolt Action.  It was really a different game from the contemporaries of its own time (Angriffe and Tractics), but it did compete, somewhat, with Jagdpanzer and possibly the WRG 1925-1950 rules  The latter played faster (and I had some extremely enjoyable games of the WRG WW2 rules), but they sacrificed more detail in the quest for faster play..With Overwatch, you get all that neat data driven analysis and comparison, and the game moves quickly.  That's probably why we played it for most of the 80s.(This is a continuation of my thoughts about a mapless Medieval campaign supporting tactical medieval rules, such as Chainmail.  This represents just some further thoughts about a random generation system for determining what \"lands\" would be in your demesne.)Working on the Medieval campaign rules some more has turned into me experimenting with distributions and stochastic curves, as I look at using a 3d6 system, and a 2d6 system.  Here are both charts, presented as I was experimenting with them.      3d6 Version2d6 Version       3 - Orchards 4 - Vineyard 5 - Port 6 - Town 7 - Free Land 8 - Forest 9 - Forest10 - Farm11 - Farm12 - Pasture13 - Pasture14 - Free Land15 - Church16 - Highlands17 - Fish Ponds18 - Orchards     2 - Vineyard 3 - Port 4 - Town 5 - Freeland 6 - Forest 7 - Farm 8 - Pasture 9 - Church10 - Highlands11 - Fish Ponds12 - Orchards  In both cases, I think I got the frequency correct, of the different types of Lands, in relationship to each other.  However, I am thinking that I will go with the 2d6 system, because it means that the land types at both legs of the system (meaning, Vineyards, Ports, Fish Ponds, and Orchards) are extremely rare in the 3d6 system, and I did not intend that to happen.Next will be assigning troop types to the different lands... and working on the limits and options inherent in the economic system (money sources, money sinks, and market options)."},

{"title": "Medieval Campaign ideas - developing", "date": "Sunday, October 30, 2016", "text": "My recent review of Chainmail, and subsequent organizing of a solo game of Medievals (involving some re-basing and prepping of miniatures) got me thinking again about campaign as the narrative for wargames.  Providing context and texture - why we fight, where we fight, and the bigger goals/aims of the battle other than just attrition.Which of course had me return back to one of the things I think wargame campaigns are very interesting at - that is, providing a game mechanic for determining the composition of armies, especially in a way that is a little bit out of control of the player.  In a lot of set-piece meeting engagement games, the player will bring whichever version of his army suits him - either by spending points, or just by picking units from his collection.In a campaign, of course, there might be constraints or circumstances that limit this decision.  One of the things in a medieval setting that would limit the troops available would be the fief system, where each noble in the heirarchy would have others who owed him a feudal obligation (of land and soldiery), and he in turn owed such an obligation to his lord.  So by determining the size and status of the fief that a noble controls, one can estimate the size and nature of the army.Years ago, Ben King used to host a great medieval game called Feudal.  It allowed for a number of provinces in a realm to be divided up among the players.  These would then each provide some troops (knights, men-at-arms, archers, etc) depending on the type of province.  I am going to borrow some of that concept here.Similarly, when Warhammer Ancient Battles was first published, the book had rules in it for a mapless campaign.  There, each province type would allow you to purchase different types of troops that your army might or might not have access to, but the provinces were determined randomly.  Again, these are useful ideas for what I am trying here.The point of the exercise is to provide a basis for a medieval army.  There should be a reliable core of the army that feels distinctly medieval - maybe some knights?  Maybe some men-at-arms?  Other than that, there should be a total of, more or less, 12 units per army (just my own personal preference).  In this highly ordered idea of an generic army, I am going for a mixture of typical medieval units (both English and Continental), and not particularly the sorts of historical archetypes that arose where an army had (largely) one or two types of troops (such as early Swiss armies that were almost all halberdiers, or an Imperial force that was almost all mounted knights).  That could happen in this system, randomly, but it would be rare. Terminology is important, for setting the tone and feel of a game.  So, rather than going with provinces, I am going to use the term Lands.  A Lord (the name for the ruler that a Player is representing) would control a Demesne of around a dozen Lands.  But lets make it random.  Dice (2d6)Lands in Demesne2-3104-5116-8129-101311-1214Here we have a method for a Lord to have a number of Lands in his Demesne.  One of these would represent his Manor, where his castle is.  The others would be of a random type.  Each would provide two things for the Lord of the Manor - feudal troops, and money.  Here is a list of some example ideas...Free Land - no troops provided, but the tenant peasants pay rent - $$Port - access to foreign troops? (pike, crossbow) - $Vineyard -infantry, money - $Town - urban type troops (halberd, sword-and-buckler) - $Farm - infantry, sergeants (armored cavalry, but not knights)Forest - archers, hobilarsPasture - light horse, slingers, money (from wool) - $Highlands - light infantry, light horse Orchards - men at arms (an effective manor, attracts followers) - $Fish Ponds - sergeants (a wealthy manor, can afford to support stables) - $Church - knights (order?)This idea is still developing, but I am envisioning a table, maybe 3-18, with entries for the different types of lands listed above.  Each type would have a random set of troops that it would provide, and a random amount of money value.Money would be used for either upgrading troops, or hiring mercenaries.Commonality of Land types would be something like this...Most CommonFarmForestPastureFree LandCommonTownChurchPortHighlandsLeast Common VineyardFish PondsOrchardsThe idea is still brewing, but it has some merit, I think."},
{"title": "WRG Armored Warfare 1950-1985 - Review", "date": "Friday, October 28, 2016", "text": "This is another review in the Once and Future Rules series, of wargame rules that are out of print, but that got a lot of play at one time (at least, in the clubs and groups I played in since the early 1980s). If you don’t like us, don’t accept our invitations and don’t invite us to come to see you. Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury you.                            - Nikita Khrushchev One of the types of wargames that was extremely popular with one of the main groups of friends I gamed with in the 1980s was modern micro armor.  This was tactical battles, with 1:285 or 1:300 scale vehicles (ground and air, and some sea), fighting out battles either from historical conflicts that had taken place since 1945 (mostly African brush wars, and various Middle Eastern conflicts - for some reason we did not go into India/Pakistan or other conflicts).  Considering the levels of fear and hysteria that were pervasive in society at the time, it is quite strange that we did this as a hobby.  But, we did, and quite honestly the games were pretty fun.Of the groups I played with, there were really two extremely popular rulesets that we played.  The first was the WRG published Wargames Rules for Armoured Warfare at Company and Battalion Battle Group Level 1950-1985, and the much more shortly titled Challenger from Tabletop Games.  Being detail fanatics at the time (for some reason, that generation of wargamers thought that more and more detail included in the combat model of the wargame made it somehow more realistic), we would often go for the Challenger rules, but for simpler games, I preferred the WRG rules (besides, they covered more situations, and played faster).  I may do a review of the Challenger rules later on, as a comparison.  Other rulesets we played were the extremely detailed \"Engage and Destroy\", and some homebrew rules.Games would be one-off set piece battles, frequently, but once in a while one member of the group or other would devise a particularly clever scenario (usually of the extremely large variety, or of the extremely novel variety).  We would play all sorts of levels of games, with front line Soviet forces facing off against first tier NATO forces; Arab-Israeli conflicts; second and third tier European conflicts (I recall Czechoslovakia vs. Denmark) and just about anything inspired by the likes of General Sir John Hackett, Harold Coyle, or Tom Clancy.  I recall a game involving battalions of Soviet airborne troops invading Newport News Virginia, and the gangs of national guard and ROTC students from the local universities were assisted by wargamers (we actually played that scenario, it was a ton of fun).  But in the main, we had a lot of Fulda Gap style heavy metal games (heavy metal referring to lots of tanks, APCs, IFVs and the like) between NATO and Warsaw Pact forces.  On the other hand, over the decade of the 80s, a whole host of campaigns were hosted by a good friend, under the name of \"Warlords\" which featured WW2 and Modern equipment, mixing it up by small tribal warlords fighting in a post-WW4 wasteland.But here I am reviewing the WRG rules.  As mentioned, these are tactical rules covering ground combat in the decades following WW2, right up to 1985.  The version I played was published in 1979, and was pretty well complete with rules for the normal ground combat (infantry, armor, and artillery) plus rules for ATGWs (anti-tank guided weapons - missiles), helicopters, air combat between fixed wing craft, combat engineering and other elements of modern warfare.The game was played at a 1:1 scale, for vehicles.  Infantry elements would represent (as a single stand - frequently we would use a cardboard chit, or a small base with 1:285 infantry based on it) a rifle group (maybe 3,4 or 5 men), or a weapon team (an ATGW team, mortar and crew, MG or similar).  The ground scale for these rules is 1 inch for 50 meters.  Turns represent about a minute and a half of expended time (the rules spend a paragraph describing how it is 100 seconds of time, but hit probabilities are only based on a second firing 30 seconds of its ROF, because of blah blah blah).The rules have a pretty extensive set of points values for just about everything you could imagine, and the means for pointing up vehicle platforms, based on the sensors and weapons it carries.  For instance, if you wanted to do a particular model of aircraft, and know what cannon it mounts, what missiles or bombs it carries, and what sort of weapons tracking and target identification sensors it has, you could calculate the points value for it.Luckily, there was a great set of publications done by Tabletop Games in support of their own game (Challenger II), which also featured rules and stats for the same vehicles and units in the WRG rules.  During those days, I loved reading through the various \"Digests\", especially Digest #2, and #4 and 5 - 2 was the list of world equipment (from all sorts of nations, and covering all sorts of equipment), and #4 and 5 were European (NATO and Warsaw Pact) organizations in one, and other parts of the globe (Africa, Middle East, Far East) in the other.  There were also some specific books with OBs and equipment from the 1950s (a wide variety of organizations) and scenarios and OBs for the MidEast wars, and others.Back to the WRG rules . . . As these are first and foremost rules for Armoured conflict, they have a system for rating the armor values of all fighting vehicles.  This is done by a Roman numeral ranging from the weakest vehicles getting a I on up to the strongest state-of-the-art tanks getting a X.  Note, that last category in 1979 include the rumoured Leopard 3, the UK's MBT 80, and the US's XM1 tank, which would later become known as the M1 Abrams.  In addition, the exotic special armor additions that were becoming popular (chobham plating, spaced armor, active protection systems, etc) are noted in this system by some classes also having subclasses of \"s\" and some with sublcasses of \"S\" - the former for a turret having special extra protection, and the latter of the whole hull having special extra protection.  The above named tanks were all XS armor.The game was recommended to play on an area of roughly 60x100 inches (3000m by 5000m - to give the battlefield enough room for the weapons systems to reach out and flex their muscles).  The group I was with played on several 5x9 tables (modeled after ping pong tables, because of some historical ties to the old Gene McCoy Wargamer's Digest magazine, and all the 4x8 and ping pong table sized scenarios in them...), and also a nice hefty 6x12 table.  So we had plenty of space.Example map from Wargamer's DigestRules exist for modeling the communications net, and to handle battlefield orders for the game.  Often we would not play with orders, unless a referee was present for the battle. Once the game started, it was composed of alternating turns.  The turn sequence was pretty clever - it had morale tests first, then registering requests for artillery and airstrikes, executing those attacks that were requested previously and successfully arrived, executing tactical actions, in order (full moves first, all other actions next), and then dealing with suppressive fire, that might affect troop posture, etc.  One thing that the rules allowed, to make up for the fact that there was no opportunity fire, was that each element that could fire, could fire its very first shot for the turn (sometimes the ROF would be higher than once per turn) at an enemy unit anywhere along it's immediate previous movement path.  All other shots had to be at the final resting place of units following their movement for the turn.The rules have movement values for all the typical vehicle types (including things such as hovercraft).  Moves and ranges are given in meters, which convert to inches.  So, a fast tracked vehicle could travel 500 meters in a turn - that equates to 10 inches cross country.  Roads give a bonus, lots of terrain features really bog down vehicle movement. Dealing with the high tempo of modern combat, and the hide and seek nature of vehicles that can move at dozens of miles per hour, and have stabilization allowing them to fire on the move, means that some rules for target acquisition must apply.  It is impractical to keep all the units off table that no enemy can spot, so instead most modern rule sets have rules for acquisition - which then limits who can see a target to shoot at it, or report it to a request for air strike or artillery, etc.  These rules are no different, and are based on the target type vs the distance from the would-be spotter.  Modifiers for lots of situations and equipment, and then single d6 roll determines success.  Rules exist to cover what happens if you fail to spot (for instance) the sniper in the building, but in stead rolled well enough to acquire the building itself (the idea is you found the sniper, in general, but did not see him long enough to aim a weapon).  This allows you to fire area effect or suppressive fire at the target, but not (much deadlier) aimed fire.Direct fire can then be applied to targets known.  This includes aimed fire and suppressive fire.  Weapons such as missiles cannot perform suppressive fire, nor can large mortars.  Small mortars can, as can most other weapons.  Rules exist covering who can fire (for instance, troops in an IFV, such as a West German Marder, are limited to two elements firing from hatches, and so on), arc of fire, and so forth.  Rules exist defining defile zones and dead zones behind a raised terrain feature (like a hill crest).  Then the method is simple - find your weapon on the hit chart, cross index it with the range, and you have a target number for your D6 roll, to hit.  Benefits of this system: if you have multiple shooters and multiple targets (like platoons or companies of tanks encountering each other, or stands of infantry fighting other stands of infantry), then rolling multiple dice at one time is a viable game-speeding tactic.Hits are then followed up by dicing for results.  This is again based on the weapon, and range at which the hit took place.  Then a look up table determines if it is an automatic kill, or a dice chance for a kill, or no chance at all - based on target armor.  Two such look up tables exist, one for hits vs. Tanks and other vehicles; the other exists for tracking hits vs. infantry, soft vehicles, and other soft targets.There are rules for artillery fire (including things like making a successful request for artillery support, counter battery fire, different types of fire missions (programmed, preregistered, or impromptu).  Artillery effects from hits are derived form a chart, matching weapon system vs. target type.Extra rule sections exist covering air combat, air insertions (helicopters and paradrops), night fighting, chemical and nuclear weapons, and finally, a method for determining the victor based (mostly) on surviving tabletop elements.  Engineering and other tasks are covered.These rules provide for a fairly fast game, at the expense of detail.  At the time, when we would play these over the Challenger rules, it seemed like we were cheating, by not taking into account the many different layers of detail covered in those rules.  But . . . a company on company (say, 10-15 tanks each) in Challenger might take as long as 2 or 3 hours to play out, especially if they have more interesting weapon systems.  In the WRG rules, maybe half an hour or hour.I like them.  I don't know if modern gamers would find these attractive.  These days for modern warfare I would actually represent Cold War Commander, with its mechanisms for representing the problems of modern C4I, plus the more elegant mechanics of modern rules.  But, in my professional life, I research and teach about simulation systems, including combat simulation systems, and it is interesting that most modern combat simulators that operate at the individual entity level use a combat adjudication system called PH/PK - which is \"percent hit and percent kill\".  That is a percent chance to get a hit at various range brackets (in the WRG rules this is reduced to a d6 roll, but the same mechanism), and then a chance to score a kill, or lesser hit, based on the weapon system vs armor.   So the same methods and techniques are part of modern computer simulations.Good rules.  Much quicker than many alternatives.  Lots of options for weapon systems, equipment, and so forth.  I don't know that in a post 1991 world that these rules still hold up, especially with more modern equipment. They don't cover modern situations like command nets being augmented by things like cell phones, and the presence of drones and UAVs on the battlefield.  But then, they were written in 1979.  For the historical conflicts between 1945 and 1990, they are probably still a very good set of rules, if you like the mechanics.  I would still play them.  And I might listen to Nena or Sting while doing it."},

Niccolo Machiavelli Personal ReflectionOne of the great things about my war gaming life in the 1980s (and the 1990s, to a certain extent) was that I was exposed to a lot of different gaming groups, and different gaming styles.  For a while, around the years 1984-85 I was involved with two different groups of wargamers/friends that were very much interested in the Renaissance, as a war gaming period.  One group was a very varied set of gamers who played lots of different periods.  Another group largely played the rules written by one of the members of that group.  A third group would tend to focus (for a short, but intense time) on a certain period or set of rules.  Most of them/us were also medieval and ancients players, and while there were very large 25mm armies floating around the community I played in, most of those armies were not Renaissance armies, so it was up to us to construct 15mm armies when it became the period we focused on.  But we needed rules.Eventually, we would settle on particular subsets of periods, and particular subsets of rules.  But for a short while, we fooled around with Peter Harris' rules, Tercio.  We had access to both 4th edition (which this review mostly focuses on) and also the recently published 5th edition.  I don't know why, but it seems to me that we mostly played with copies of 4th edition laying around, although we always were checking things out in 5th edition.  I recall some arguments about the 4th edition book being more concise (which it sort of is), and also more straightforward (which it also is).To be fair, we looked at a lot of rules, and the only ones we refused to play were the Newbury \"Fast Play rules for Medieval and Renaissance Warfare (1300-1500)\".  Oh boy.Rules IntroTercio is a set of rules for Renaissance miniatures games (the cover mentions the period 1500-1700) written by Peter Harris, and releases (initially) in 1976.  Sadly, I do not know the history of the first three editions.  It was (in its 4th edition) written for 25mm figures (which we ignored, and used 15mm figures, but so be it), and the ground scale was 1 inch to 10 meters.  The rulebook begins with loads of information on how to classify your troops (of which, there are a lot of data points required for each unit), also points values, base sizes, and  set of guidelines for setting up random battlefields.One of the hallmarks of many 70s rulesets (and one I have mostly moved on from, as have most other wargamers I know from the period) is writing rules.  Tercio, as a tournament rule set, had specific rules for orders, how they can be changed, and when they had to (or were allowed to) be changed.  In short, you had to write basic battlefield orders at the beginning of the game (i.e. - \"pike/shot unit will advance to the crossroads, and then deploy and act defensively\").  Then, once the game started, you should basically keep those orders in mind as you perform tactical moves, shooting, etc during the game.  Rules existed for sending signals, changing standing orders, etc.  During the game, however, the only turn-to-turn orders that were required by the rules were Charges, and if any pre-arranged orders (based on signals) were written at the start of the game.In practice, our group used Charge declaration markers - chits that had Charge written on them, mixed in to a handful of other chits that had nothing written on them.  Each turn, we would place one facedown chit behind each unit, using a Charge chit for units to charge, and a blank chit everywhere else.  It was much quicker than writing, and was immediately apparent once you turned over the chits.Turn OrderThe turn order for the game (called the \"Move Procedure\" - a phrase that has stuck with me) was pretty typical for a simultaneous move game, and is really not all that different from the turn sequence in Dominance.  The difference, for Tercio, is in the specificity of when things happen.  And, that there are two pre-contact charge morale tests.  First, before moving chargers, any charging unit that has already taken a certain amount of casualties must test morale.  Second, after any moves, reaction moves, and firing due to charges and routs, there is a second morale test for all units that charged, and are about to contact.  Also those units being charged.  Once all this testing is done, then there is final shooting, other than vs chargers, and it all ends with melee resolution, and final (post-melee) morale tests.A simplified description could be:Chargers chargeMorale test for ContactShootFightMorale tests from fightingMovement rates are given in millimeters (I like inches, in spite of being a scientist and working in the metric system all the time) and maneuvers are given in terms of how much time (quarter move, half, full, etc) it takes a unit (based on training) to perform.CombatFiring rules are pretty straight forward.  This is a \"factors and table\" system, as per Dominance, and not the last such system I played for the Renaissance period.  The system is pretty deterministic, and works by figuring out the basic factors for weapon vs. armor; a short list of modifiers; and a d6 roll, to generate a modifier of -2 to +2.  A casualty table is consulted, and deaths of men are noted (every 20 deaths results in a figure removal).  Rules for ammunition, different firing types (volley, etc), and artillery are included.Melee rules are similar (same dice toss for factor modifier of -2 to +2), with the basic factor being based on cavalry or infantry, and weapon type - vs. armor of the opposing unit.  Once casualties are generated for both sides, it is important to determine the combat results.  This is done with a very nice, and convenient chart, that matrices the casualties inflicted by the losing side (the side which inflicted the least number of casualties vs. the number of casualties that the winning side inflicted).  Once the column specifying the correct ratio is determined, then there is a Letter result that is based on the nature of the matchup (infantry vs infantry, cavalry vs cavalry, or cavalry vs infantry).  These letters determine the basic resolution of the combat round.  An example result is:\"E\" - If infantry win, cavalry will rout.  If cavalry wins, the infantry will rout and the cavalry will pursue for two moves. Having  a system to determine the winner of the melee, and the results, is very nice, and is quite separate from morale tests (although the chart also generates the reason for making those tests, as well).  Note that Chainmail does something similar, but is based on comparing a total based on the number of figures remaining, plus factors for most casualties inflicted, and larger remaining unit.  Those are compared (as described in the Chainmail rulebook, and commented on in the review), and then melee results are calculated.  The Tercio system has much more interesting results, because of the way it is done, but it requires consulting two different charts following each melee combat.  That is in addition to the factor look up table, the list of modifiers, and the casualty table for each side, just to generate the number of casualties inflicted.  At least with the Chainmail system, if you know the points values of your troops, the whole mechanic can be done in your head, or on the back of a note card with a pencil, in about 20 seconds.ExtrasFinally, there are rules for executing morale tests, rallying, routs, pursuits, and other aspects.  A simple weather system is also included.  That pretty much concludes the 4th edition rules.One thing, before I write my opinion of playing Tercio.  The description of troops has a lot of data included in it.  There is a factor for training level (T1, T2, T3), there is a factor for Morale (M1, M2...) there is a tactical group (ST - Skirmish, FT- Firepower, MT - Melee), there is an Organizational identifier (Regular, Feudal, Mercenaries), finally there is formation type (Close, Open, Normal).  These factors all come into play in the different rules subsystems in the game.  This may, or may not, be better than the typical WRG Ancients system where a unit is has one factor representing training and morale (A,B,C, etc).In addition to the above factors, Tercio also lists army type (Light, Medium, Heavy, Extra Heavy, Super Heavy), and weapons carried.  These factors are onerous enough to keep track of when you are writing up your own army, but if you use the published lists, it is important to make sure you are keeping track of the different unit types, because of subtle differences.It still bears my name on the outside.Which brings me to a quick note about 5th Edition.  As mentioned, we played 4th edition.  There is not a lot of difference, except that for everything in 4th edition, there is MORE in 5th edition.  More rules, more troop types (allowing more army types and troop types to be represented), more factors, more optional and subsystems.  And, 5th edition also include an army list book as part of the publication.4th edition, which is just the rules, comes in at just over 40 pages.  5th edition is two books in one (rulebook and army list book), and the rules themselves are something like 53 pages long.  Admittedly, there is some really nice artwork (very similar, and by the same artist that did the work for the Shock of Impact rule book, published around the same time, for ancient warfare).  But there is another 50 pages of army lists, divided up by period.  This is very nice, and has some interesting features (like, each army has predefined core units, and then some extra units that can be purchased using points).  The organization of sub units and interesting organization representing some of the Renaissance infantry formations (main body of pike, with sub bodies of halberdiers, shot, etc) is done very nicely by these rules, and they cover a lot of territory in terms of the wars and armies of the period.Two army lists - Imperial 16th Century and Milanese, same periodMy thoughts - Tercio is a neat set of rules.  I think it has not aged well, but most of the subsystems are pretty good, and other than a very deterministic combat system, and a factors and table combat system, it is not bad.  However, I recall from playing it that while it was a very serious attempt at simulating warfare, we had no feel that we were playing Renaissance armies fighting each other.  There is just too much abstract detail, and it does not have any glossing over of the fact, to make if feel like the period.   It is possible that the habit of many late 70s and early 80s rulesets to try to become more \"serious\" by piling on more data had the same effect.For instance, while playing you would be talking about your M1/T1 troops, instead of talking about your \"Fanatic Professionals\".  The former gets a little stale.  And the order writing/charge declaration system (along with simultaneous movement - which ALWAYS generates arguments) is a thing of the past.  We tried to keep it smooth and streamlined by using order chits for charge, but that was done better in Johnny Reb, and that is a different ball of wax.  The method my friend Ron and I used (maybe from the Pike and Shot society?) of using a d20 to determine the odd casualty each turn, instead of maintaining a casualty roster, was pretty good and could have been applied here.  But, it all felt stale, and sort of dry. The data contained in the army lists from the 5th edition book, included as a bonus, is nice, as is the terrain and weather system (which can easily be stolen for other rules/periods).  Again, with different gaming groups, my experience was different.  With one group, we would play Hackbutt and Pike (by Ben King), in another group we would play The Universal Soldier for Renaissance, and finally with another group we would play George Gush's rules.  Finally, I settled on two sub periods, the Italian Wars, for which even Might of Arms was a good solution, and ECW for which I found some specialty rules (Forlorn Hope, 1644, Cavaliers & Roundheads).So, Tercio was interesting, but it didn't last.  I think that it would have even a smaller chance of surviving today.  I included it in this series of reviews for the nostalgia and respect I have for Harris' rules, but also to serve as a comparison to Dominance (which I liked, but didn't play nearly often enough), and George Gush's rules (which I have yet to review, but it is coming).  It is emblematic of TTG rulesets of the period, being very thorough, and very much dominated by charts, factors, and different subsystems and classification systems from other rule sets.But at least it isn't the Newbury Fastplay Rules."},
{"title": "Horsing Around at the Painting Table", "date": "Wednesday, October 26, 2016", "text": "I recently received a shipment of 40mm x 30mm MDF bases, which means it is time to get caught up on some cavalry basing.First up, 12 stands (36 figures) of armored 17th century cavalry.  These could be useful either as continental Cuirassiers in the Thirty Years War (or some time earlier).  Possible as Schwarzreiter during the Schmalkaldic War (maybe a little early for these figures, maybe not).  Also possible as Lobsters in ECW.Next up, I have a unit that are clearly Reiters, from the look of their equipment and the plumed helmets.  As with the Cuirassiers above these fellows have 3/4 armor, black, and with pistols.  Different helmet styles, and slightly different armor styles are the big difference.Moving away from the Renaissance (although not very far away), I also started re-basing my later Medieval Knights.  These fellows would fit right in during the late 14th or 15th centuries.  My inspiration?  I got these out to play a late medieval solo game of Chainmail (in honor of St. Crispin's Day), and was reminded of the basing situation.  That, with a new box of bases staring at me, told me to put off the solo game, and get the Knights re-based.  (as opposed to Chaucer, who would have them Debased).This evening, I sorted out the first part of this collection, all of which need to be re-based.  In doing the sorting, I uncovered four basic categories of knights. There are knights (of different helmet designs) on chaffroned horses.  There are knights on horses with just harness.  There are knights on barded (metal barding) horses.  And there are figures (knights?) who are carrying standards, musical instruments, etc - that could be part of these units.I selected out the knights who were mounted on horses with just harness (and not full chaffron or  barding).  There were enough to do 14 stands of knights (3 figures per stand).  Those are who I based this evening (pictured above).  So why pull out the un-chaffroned knights?  Wargamers (and wargames army lists) love to differentiate.  Variety is the spice of life, after all.  In many army lists, there are second tier (or even third tier) Knights, representing either lower nobility, poor knights, mercenary heavy horse, etc.  These will be instantly identifiable on the table, as being different from the chaffroned knights, or the barded knights.  And there is still a lot of variety in pose, equipment, and armor style (probably too much variety in armor style - but I go to war with the army I have, rather than the army I want).Finally, a few units I actually based a few nights ago.  These will see service in an upcoming 2nd Punic War game (at Fall In 2016).  Four Roman units, at three stands per unit.  These are in with my Late Republic Romans, but from looking at the equipment, and depending on the theater of operations, these could be (possibly) Pre-Marian, on up to maybe 1st century AD.  At least in 15mm scale, that is my claim. (the High Medieval knights are in the background). All this in addition to work I've done lately on my 16th century infantry (Swiss, German, and Spaniards).  In a day or two when the glue is set, I will flock the bases on all those above, and they will be off to fight in Flanders. Or Burgundy. Or Gaul.  Or Saxony.  Or Lincoln.  Or maybe just stay here in Stafford.Pax."},
{"title": "Push of Pike - historical notes about the Pike", "date": "Monday, October 24, 2016", "text": "As a topic that got spurred on by all my late medieval and Renaissance wargaming activities lately, I did some reading about the lengthy catalyst of RMAs - the Pike. (RMAs are Revolutions in Military Affairs, and if you have never heard the name Michael Roberts, or of his first attacker, and later defender Geoffrey Parker, then you have been spared a great deal of historian's argument).'Bad War' by Hans HolbeinThere is a great article on the Push of Pikes, their employ, their length, etc - in an article called The push of pike in the 14th Century, from earlier this year (February 2016).  It is from a blog on historical topics, including such things as costume from different periods.  One of the gems of the article is the widespread basis for quotes and references.  Here is a great quote that is made, about a captain (Hynrick van Gemen) telling his men how to employ the Pike (presumably they were not veteran soldiers), during a battle protecting Münster from an invasion in 1407.Gy menne, de nyn harnsch anne en hebben, gy solt achter uns beharnscheden gaen, und wyket nycht und schuwet uns und steket myt den peyken under de iseren hode.\"You men, who have no armour on you, you shall go behind our armoured (men) and will not move nor fear and you will stab with the pikes underneath the iron hats (in the faces of the enemy).\"But, of course, there is a lot of debate over whether or not there was ever a Push of Pike type engagement, where two pike formations actually engaged each other.  Lots of opinion on the internet, including an interesting discussion by a fellow that runs a blog called Swords and Socialism, where he reduces a pike-to-pike encounter as having three stages: Prodding (attempting to reach, and stab, without being stabbed), Pushing (when the blocks become locked, and it is a scrum, or shoving match, both bodies of men effectively having gotten \"under\" the pikes), and Panic (where one side or the other loses their cool, and departs the encounter).  I don't know how authoritative this is, or is it just a gleaning of information from other popular sources?A video I uncovered also addresses the issue, and the presented supposes that pikes never actually faced pikes, just sort of had a machismo showdown until one side or the other fled (usually whichever side was not, in order, either (1) Swiss, (2) Landsknechts, (3) Spaniards, (4) Anyone else).This fellow (his youtube channel goes by the name of Lindybeige) may have a point.  Now, a historian that was interested in finding out just how a pike formation worked, was Hans Delbrück, who in the research for his History of the Art of War, actually took men out in the field, gave them pikes, drilled them, and made notes as to how they behaved.  Equally, Charles Oman with his Art of War in the Sixteenth Century, is also quite influential, and does his homework.One thing is certain, and that is starting with the Scots in their fight against the English, in the 14th century, and going on up until the last elements of pikes were removed from the musketry units in the Great Northern War of the early 18th century, one of the key formations of infantry power on the battlefield was the pike.  Was it defensive?  Was it offensive?  There are many opinions, all by people who have no first hand experience.In the piece of artwork at the top of this posting, Holbein (who is responsible for fantastic portraits of Erasmus, Thomas More, Henry VIII and a couple of other chaps you may have heard of) does a drawing called \"bad war\" which was between Swiss pikemen and German Landsknechte.  Both had a reputation for being efficient, well trained, and ruthless, and were foes of each other (the two biggest kids on the block).  Since the Italian Wars, and moving on from there into the 16th century, they were often employed against each other, and the concept of a bad war (as illustrated by Holbein) is one where neither pike block will swerve, and the pikes and doppelsoldners with their two handed swords, halberds, and worse will chew into each other, in an extremely bloody scrum.LandsknechteThe Spanish were certainly avowed fans of the Pike, as seen throughout the 80 years war and others, with their much celebrated Tercio formation.  Fans of warfare from this period could do much worse than to track down and see the film Alatriste (with Viggo Mortenson in the title role), about a Spanish unit that is fated to fight the French at the battle of Rocroi.Spanish at Rocroi - by Augusto Ferrer-DelmauA list of push-of-pike engagements includes a lot of the seminal battles of the 16th century.  According to wikipedia, this list includes:Arbedo (1422) - Milan vs. the SwissRavenna (1512) - Duchy of Ferrara (and France) vs. Papal States (and Spain)Novara (1513) - Venice (with France) vs Milan (with Swiss)Pavia (1525) - France vs. Charles V (HRE Emperor, who is also Charles I of Spain)Ceresole (1544) - France vs. HRE in the Italian WarsLangside (1568) - Moray vs. Mary, Queen of ScotsSanto Domingo (1586) - the only battle listed in the New WorldZutphen (1586)Nieuwpoort (1600) - Look at this map of the battle - zoom in and look at the detail!Benburb  (1646) - Irish (Owen Roe O'Neill) vs Scots Covenanters and English ColonistsThis does not include any battles from the English Civil War (unless you include Benburb, which I won't), nor from the Thirty Years War (such as the battle of Lutzen).  It does include four of the major conflicts of the Italian Wars (Ravenna, Novara, Pavia, and Ceresole).Wargamers, of course, want to get the history correct (when they can).  But, whether the clash of pike-on-pike resulted in a mutual stabbing affair, a crushing scrum, or a macho staring contest until one side or the other departed - it doesn't matter. The rulesets will tell you which of the figures are dead (or no longer able to function in combat), and which are due rewards for behavior (by winning a \"combat\").  Regardless of what this means in real life, the fact that the pike was the main weapon of massed infantry formations (including the elite formations of the day - the pike blocks of the Swiss Cantons), and that it was extremely effective vs. musketry formations and cavalry formations, and that it was vulnerable to artillery fire, and that it would occasionally be asked to go head to head, and toe to toe, with an enemy pike formation.  It is a part of military history, and so the push of pike clash has earned a place in our historical wargames.Steve the Wargamer has put together a great list of the Table Top Teasers that have become available online.  These are wargame scenarios written by Charles Grant in order to stir up some interest in a type of scenario or period, and hopefully to get the reader thinking more about a particular wargaming topic, or excited to try out the scenario.  Here is an example.From Steve's website...Over a period of years in the late 70's and early 80's, Charles Grant published a series of articles in \"Battle\", and then \"Military Modelling\" called the 'Table Top Teasers'.As time has passed I've picked up various copies, been given some, but have basically collected a number of them together - they're an invaluable source of scenario idea's, so on this page I thought I'd share them with the world.The page is intended then as a resource for what I think were a brilliant set of articles, and an endless source of good game ideas - I've played these games over and over again... the page is also meant as a VERY respectful \"nod of the head\" in the direction of one of the \"greats\" in the wargaming world, namely Charles Grant, and a now legendary series of articles... my thanks to Charles for giving permission for me to continue hosting these articles. These are definitely worth checking out, and would be worth the time for any table top wargamer, regardless of what rules or scale he/she plays, to check these out.  Great stuff.These are different from the wargaming scenarios books that CS Grant has published over the years, some of which have provided great games and scenarios for various club (ODMS, Roundtable Wargaming Club) games and convention games I've been involved in.  I am sure they will, again, in the future.Great scenario book - the book has scenarios keyed to appropriate periods of history, hence the title.  Very accessible, great maps, and great games ranging from regular set piece battles, down to interesting skirmish and adventure games.Another great scenario book - this was the first professional scenario book for miniature wargames that I ever owned.  I loaned it away years ago, and it never found its way home again.  I am always on the lookout for another copy.  (email me if you have one...)Invaluable for the solo wargamer.  Lots of great info about generating orders of battle for three broad periods (ancient/medieval; horse and musket; mechanized warfare).  Information about generating characteristics for \"fictional\" opposed generals, and great ways to set up a battlefield with fog of war, even if playing solo.A good review of the Table Top Teasers, and some of the other scenario books of Mr. Grant (including those above, and his multiple volumes of Wargaming in History) can be found at Wargaming Info.Chuck"},
{"title": "Chainmail - review", "date": "Saturday, October 22, 2016", "text": "This is another review in the Once and Future Rules series, of wargame rules that are out of print, but that got a lot of play at one time (at least, in the clubs and groups I played in since the early 1980s).Bring me my broadsword and clear understanding.Bring me my cross of gold as a talisman.Bless with a hard heart those who surround me.Bless the women and children who firm our hands.                  - Jethro Tull, \"Broadsword\" So, following on Broadsword as the first dedicated Medieval rules reviewed as part of this series, I would like to return to a ruleset that was hugely influential in my wargaming history, at least once I started playing at wargaming shops and clubs.  That ruleset is Chainmail: Rules for Medieval Miniatures, by Gary Gygax & Jeff Perren.The set I have, and the one I played way back in the early 80s, was the third edition (mine is a printing from the late 70s).  Earlier editions were from Guidon Games, before TSR acquired the title.  These are (like Cavaliers and Roundheads) based on the wargaming philosophy of Jeff Perren, and have some Gygax additions/edits in them.  The book itself actually contains several rulesets, but the main body (and the main version I played) is the big battle set for Medieval set piece battles, between opposing armies.BackgroundA word about the quote I have above, from Jethro Tull.  It might seem as if that quote would go better with the review I wrote for Broadsword, rather than the one I did there from the Byzantine princess (one of my favorite scholarly heroines from history).  But, it is included here because at the time I was being introduced to Chainmail, and playing it a lot, I was also deepening my interest in (and fomenting a lifelong admiration for) art rock, including (among the rest) Jethro Tull.  And Broadsword and the Beast, was one of my favorite albums of 1982.  Besides, I don't know of a song called Chainmail.Chainmail, as I was introduced to it, and would come to play it, was played by guys who had large armies (or parts of armies, several players combining their forces) of 25mm figures, numbering sometimes in the many hundreds.  These were largely Minifigs, Hinchliffe, Heritage, Garrison, Grenadier, Essex and others (older manufacturers, although some of them - notably Minifigs and Essex- are still around), in what today would be called true, or old school, 25mm.  Of course in 1983, they weren't old school at all.  The painting styles were very different then, almost all figures were painted in a block style, with little or no shading or washing.  Often figures were gloss coated, or even painted by model enamels (Testers, Humbrol, etc.).  Armies were frequently mounted on stands of balsa wood that would be painted green (no flocking).  A great example of the painting style of the day can be seen where the author of the Broadswords and Beasts blog (a coincidence?) has recreated the style for some Infantry, and for some Knights.The crew I played Chainmail with did not play any of the WRG rule sets, although in the early 80s, the idea of a standard element width was far away, and even the WRG rule sets would only have a frontage-per-figure measurement.  I'll have to go back to check my 6th edition book of WRG ancients rules to see if there was a standard element width recommended, but 5th edition does not have an element width.  One of the complaints about Chainmail, as leveled against Cavaliers and Roundheads also, was the lack of a standard basing width for the troops.  I think that Perren & Gygax were used to playing in wargames clubs that had an understood standard.  As such, the armies I was playing with and against would have roughly 3/4 of an inch per infantry man (today, 15-20mm would be usual, so you get 3 or 4 figures on a 60mm wide stand).  About an inch per cavalry was also the norm.  Of course, once we migrated (some of us) to the Warhammer rules (which we used for historical troops), or other sets, they had base sizes, so re-basing happened.The RulesFirst of all, Chainmail is (as mentioned above), really four sets of rules.  There are the main body of the rules, which cover mass combat between armies.  These also include some information about sieges, weather, and some basic national characteristics (short of actual army lists).  They cover the basics of the tabletop wargame, movement, shooting, melee, and morale, as well as giving a turn sequence (actually, two, as described below).  But, there are three other rulesets.First, there is a set of rules for playing Man-to-Man games, such as breeches into castles, raids, or simply small skirmish games.  Here the action is on the individual man, morale is only checked for the whole army once it reaches 33% casualties, and the action is conducive to the wide variety of scenarios and free action that many skirmish games promote.Second, there is a set of rules for holding medieval tournaments, complete with jousting rules.  These are a game unto themselves, and I have played in a Joust at a wargames convention, using these rules.  Fun, if that is your thing.Third, there is a set of Fantasy rules, that can be used to extend the basic battlefield rules in the direction that was happening in the 1970s, of doing medieval wargaming with a fantasy element (think of the battles of the Lord of the Rings).  To me the Fantasy Supplement makes Chainmail a different game, albeit one that would be clearly recognizable as the predecessor of Dungeons and Dragons. Rules are included for a variety of different fantasy troop types, monsters, spells, and some magic equipment like enchanted swords.Finally, there is a set of rules (mostly a chart with some information) for extending the Man-to-Man rules in the same direction of fantasy, as the Fantasy Supplement does for the tabletop battle.Now as mentioned, I am reviewing the 3rd edition, which came out in 1975, after Dungeons and Dragons had been produced, but it is widely reported that the origins of D&D were based on the idea of a chainmail campaign where one player had done a raid, using the man-to-man rules, into an enemy castle (actually the dungeon) to rescue some prisoners.  So, I am not sure how much of the man-to-man Fantasy portions existed in the earlier (Guidon Game) version, or if it was added later.As mentioned above, there are two turn sequences given for the game.  One is for alternating moves (which requires no order writing), and one for simultaneous moves (which requires order writing, and would definitely benefit from having a referee).Movement and missile ranges are given in inches, which can be extrapolated to real life, with the scale of 1\" to 10 yards, given in the rules' introduction.  Movement is pretty straight forward, with reductions for terrain (based on troop type).  Half value for 20mm (or, presumably, 15mm) troops.Some basic rules are suggested for setting up the terrain for the battle.  Changing formation and facing is described as taking up a portion of a whole turn's movement (or two turns, in the case of infantry forming a square from a line formation - in medieval terms, this would be a schiltron or hedgehog).Simple rules are given for Fatigue, although admittedly, our group rarely used them.  They describe how much action a unit can perform before getting fatigued, which generally lowers the unit's effectiveness.  As can be seen from the description, the author carves out an exception for Swiss and Landsknechts.  This is done in multiple places throughout the rules, and while admittedly the Swiss (and the Landsknechts, also) were superior troops to many of their contemporaries, a more modern ruleset would adopt this by creating a classification system, rather than calling out exceptions by name.The rules for shooting are simple.  They are based on the armor of the enemy target - either no armor, half armored, or fully armored.  Selecting from the appropriate table representing the target armor, a die is rolled, and the number of dead enemy figures results.  This is as a function of how many figures are firing, and the tables for Unarmored and Half Armored targets cover up to 10 shooters at a time (more shooters are to be divided up into equal numbers, so 36 archers would be 3 rolls as 10 shooters, and 1 roll as 6 shooters), and the table for Fully Armored targets covers up to 20 shooters at a time.  Troops can fire from two ranks deep, so two ranks of archers, or one rank if the front is spearmen or swordsmen, and the second is archers.  And so on, with the difference that being on the front slope of a hill allows other ranks to fire overhead the friendly troops in front of them.This is very much a die per group of figures system similar to the WRG 1685-1845 rules.  They also have some similarity to Larry Brom's first edition of The Sword and the Flame.  The difference being, that in Chainmail, for a set group of figures, the dice determines how many casualties that figure does, in The Sword and the Flame 1st edition, the dice determines a divisor to determine how many casualties result from a set number of firing figures.More elaborate rules are given for gunpowder weapons, including the Arquibusiers (as spelled in the book), Cannon, and special consideration for Bombards.Melee combat rules cover how many dice are rolled, per figure, based on the enemy figure type.  Then a simple table gives what the kill range for each dice rolled, is.  So, by the following the table, a group of 9x norman knights (heavy horse) attacking 12x saxons (heavy infantry), would roll 27 dice (3 dice per man), and would score a kill on 4,5,6.  The heavy infantry, attacking back (simultaneously) would roll only 3 dice (1 die per four men), and would score a hit on a 6 only.  The numbers in this example are extreme (27 dice vs. 3 dice), but the rules are exhibiting the realities, and perceptions, of medieval warfare.  In most cases, when fighting man to man, it might be 1 dice per 2 or 3 figures.  All troops can only fight in 1 rank deep, unlike shooting.There are special considerations for flank attacks and other situations, as well as a way to calculate post-morale melee.  This involves a calculation based on the point value of the troops involved.  Multiple the troops you have surviving, by their point value (ranging from 3 for peasants, to 9 for heavy horse and Swiss pikemen).  This number is modified in two cases, to it, the side inflicting more casualties, adds to their total the difference in number of casualties (times a dice toss).  The side that survives with a larger number of troops adds to their total the difference in number of troops (times a dice toss).  Then the overall totals of each side are compared.  The results usually are one side or the other as the \"loser\" and must move back a certain amount, rout, or surrender (with optional rules for prisoners).  The calculation sounds complicated, but after doing a few times, it becomes second nature.  And it really rewards the strength of different unit types (knights are hard hitting, but usually small units, and foot formations are usually large units, so both get benefits).Morale is straight forward, and is based on checking once a unit reaches a casualty threshold.  The unit tests morale at that point (say, 33.3% for heavy foot), by rolling 2d6 against a target number.  If it fails, it is removed from battle.  If it passes, it is good, until it reaches that threshold again (so for our Heavy Foot, it tests initially after losing a third of the unit, and again considers morale a second third of the unit).  The second time it reaches the threshold, it automatically fails morale (no dice toss) and is removed.  Note, that some units have a threshold of 50%, so only test once, and if they pass, they are good until they are destroyed completely (such as knights, and Swiss pikemen).That is it for the rules.  There are optional rules, and rules for weather and national characteristics.  There are rules for sieges, but that completes the rules for the big battles.CommentsI love these rules.  A lot. They are fast, friendly, and deadly.  Meaning, easy to play, and lots of figures die.  I have a lot of fond memories of games, mostly of the Western Army vs Western Army, but we also had players with Mongol armies, and other weirdness.  Like the unlikely game between Western Knights and the Samurai army.  The fun ensued when one player, playing the Japanese, had \"ninjas\" in his army - the referee ruled them as light infantry on defense, but heavy infantry on offense, but they could start the game hidden in any terrain feature that the player wanted, as long as the referee was told.  They started hidden in a small forest in the middle of the board, and at one time a unit of knights passed too close to the forest, and the ninjas emerged and attacked the knights in the rear.  Mayhem was had, lots of howling, and laughing for years.Chainmail has a lot in common with Cavaliers and Roundheads, but have some important distinctions.  The other rulesets in the book are impressive, as well, but I only ever played the Man-to-Man rules (which I also like), but only rarely did we use the Fantasy Supplement (and then, usually for fantasy troop types and monsters, rarely did we ever use Magic, except during one large refight for the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, which had both Gandalf and the Lord of the Nazgul as able to sling spells).The man-to-man rules are worthy, and would be a good game to play these days.  I won't review them here, but when I write a review of Knights and Magick, I will do some comparison.So, Chainmail. Writing this review has re-ignited a flame in me to set out armies of knights and archers, men-at-arms and pikemen, and start rolling dice.  It sure would be good to have some armies of 800-1000 figures, of medieval troops.  Maybe that is a good project to start.  In the meantime, I might give it a try in 15mm.  Not sure it would be the same, though."},
{"title": "Broadsword: Wargame Rules for Medieval Battles - review", "date": "Thursday, October 20, 2016", "text": "This is another review in the Once and Future Rules series, of wargame rules that are out of print, but that got a lot of play at one time (at least, in the clubs and groups I played in since the early 1980s).\"They assembled from all sides, one after another, with arms and horses and all the panoply of war . . .\"                                        - Anna KomneneOther than The Universal Soldier, none of the rulesets I have reviewed so far have covered the medieval period, yet since my earliest days as a wargamer it has proven one of my favorite periods.  One of the earliest sets of rules I played was a simple set of one page medieval skirmish rules in the back of the Hinchliffe Guide to Wargaming (the second edition one, with the picture of the Zulu war figures on the front cover).  I will write a review of those later, but after that set of rules I migrated to some other sets (Knights and Magick by Arnold Hendrick; Wizards and Heroes from Heritage Games; Chainmail by Perren and Gygax; and the second edition of Warhammer, although played without magic).  Many of these are on the planning pile for reviews in this series.A set of rules that I played in the 80s a few times, but that I really liked (and the design left an impact on me) wsa a set from FGU, called Broadsword.  It was written by George Schneider, and published in 1977.  It was based on the set of rules that had come out earlier from FGU, called \"Royal Armies of the Hyborean Age\" (RAHA) that presented a set of rules for wargaming in Robert E. Howard's Conan setting.  This is interesting, as a throwback to the Tony Bath early wargaming days, where he hosted battles of the Hyborean Age as the setting for his ancient and medieval army mashups.The FGU rules for RAHA covered most ancient army types that are typical in the world of Conan, but that also covers a lot of medieval figures.  When Schneider took the rules as his inspiration, he left out the purely ancient troop types (mostly chariots and elephants) and focused more on typical medieval European armies, and troop behaviors.The set is based on a 1:20 figure scale, and recommends that missile and skirmish units be 12-18 figures each, and that shock units of infantry or cavalry be 18-36 figures each.  Large manly units!  Larger units of peasants are also mentioned.The turn sequence is based on simultaneous moves, and flows like this:Write all orders for the turn.Move for phase 1, declaring charges first.Resolve missile fire, if desired.Move for phase 2, declaring charges first.Resolve remaining missile fire.Resolve melees.Execute breakthroughs, pursuits, and retreats.Resolve pursuit and breakthrough melees.Carry out resultant mandatory retreats.The two phase movement system is interesting... each unit can do two of the following functions during a turn, but each function can itself be used only once per phase (so you could Change Formation, and Move, but you could not Move twice).  Written orders specify which:Change FormationChange FacingMove or Charge Allowable orders are not mentioned, except to note that orders must specify which function is in which phase, if a charge is phase 1 or 2, and if the unit has \"charge if charged\" orders.  Ahh, the joys of games where you have to write orders.Actual movement rates are in inches.  Which is a nice simplification.  The ranges are quite generous, and they work for 25mm figures (which is how we played it).  With 15mm figures, the author recommends halving it.But the two phases of movement, and two different actions, is an interesting system. When we played it, the folks I played it with would use a graphical system to do orders.  Each unit would be listed on a piece of paper, and then there would be ruled lines and between each, and two columns for each turn (one for each phase).  In a column, you could write FORM, FACE, or a box (representing the unit) with an arrow showing which way to move, or a C or CIC for charge, and charge-if-charged.  Simple enough, and then interpretation was done on honor system (I don't think we ever played with a referee).Shooting and Fighting both are based on a number of factors per figure (based on the fighting type, and modifiers, for a base factor - and then modified by a plus die and a minus die to randomize it).  Once you had your factor figured out, you multiply it by the number of figures fighting, to see how many casualties you did.  The system was simple, with 20 men per figure, for each full 20 casualties you did, an enemy figure would die.  So, for instance, if you have 18 knights that can fight, and they end up having a total factor value of 7 points each, on the turn they charge, by multiplying 7 x 18, you get a total of 126.  That means that 6 enemy troops would die, with 6 factors left over.The basic rules as written state, that if the leftover factors are 10 or less, then no additional figures die, but if 11 or more, then an additional figure dies.  These days, if I played, I would allow a d20 roll against the remaining casualties, to see if the extra figure dies (something I picked up from my friend Ron when we used to play the George Gush Renaissance rules way back when).In general, I would refer to this combat system as the \"factors per figure\" system, and other than a table of the base factor per figure, it is mostly done through multiplication, and the random factor comes in (as it is in Broadsword) in a dice roll modifying the base factor, or in a dice roll to determine extra kills, or both as recommended above.I personally used this system in several sets I wrote in the 80s, \"Patriot's Blood\" for the Revolutionary War, and \"KriegsHerren\" for renaissance.  It is also used in a set of Medieval rules that I ended up playing a big, called Knight Hack.  It is used in other rulesets, as well.  In reality, it could be converted to a \"factors and table\" system, if you simply multiplied out the factors by a number of figures ahead of time, and printed it on a lookup table, but basic multiplication never bugged me.The rules finish up with basic (generic) army lists for European Feudal, Saracen/Moslem, and Mongol armies.  As well as 11 historical scenarios.  A word about those scenarios - they are mostly for large armies, at least for 25mm armies.  Now, back in the 70s and early 80s, I recall playing with folks who had huge (1000+) figure armies in 25mm for medievals or renaissance.  At the time, I was just a poor student, and the only army I had that was that large was my old Orc and Goblin army that I used for Warhammer 2nd Edition.  What a beauty.  But in high school, I never could have dreamt of an army of 300 or 400 25mm knights.  So, I think we shrunk down the unit sizes to play some of the battles.  We would play with unit sizes of maybe 24 infantry, and maybe 12 cavalry. The first time I played one of the historical battles, full size, was maybe around 1985 or so, playing (from the book) the Battle of Lincoln (one of the smaller scenarios in the book).  That was fun.The king divided his army into three forces, and the opposing side did the same. The Bretons and Flemings, under the command William of Ypres and Alan of Dinan, were in the front rank of the royal army. Facing them was the fierce mob of Welshmen, led by the two brothers Maredudd and Cadwaladr. The king himself dismounted with a number of others, and fought stalwartly on foot for his life and the preservation of his kingdom. In the opposing army Earl Ranulf dismounted with his troops and reinforced a brave contingent of foot-soldiers from Chester to give battle. And Robert, earl of Gloucester, who was the greatest in the army, commanded the [men of the Bessin] and other disinherited men to strike the first blow in the battle to recover the inheritances they claimed.                            - The Ecclesiastical History of Orderic VitalisI got to play the Rebel army, loyal to Queen Matilda.  At the time, I was using 25mm figures I had recently gotten, by Essex, from the (now sadly gone) Wargames, run by Johnson Hood - their ads can be seen in many an old ruleset and wargaming magazine.  I still have some of those figures.The war was over the Barons wanting a king, rather than a queen (even though Matilda was daughter of Henry I, it is complicated, and considered by some historians as the first English civil war, also lumped together with the general 12th and13th century Baron's Wars in England, but that may be a stretch).  Although the guy playing the side of King Stephen's army used a borrowed army of medieval Germans, complete with Teutonic Knights and Sword Brothers, it was still a great game.I did a lot of research on the fight between Stephen and Maude for that game, and became quite a fan of old Maude (Queen Matilda, daughter of Henry I).  Later on, my wife and I would have a cat named for her.Broadsword is a good ruleset, and a pretty solid example of the \"factors per figure\" combat mechanism. The split movement system is pretty neat, especially since you have to do a different function for each phase.  It might be worth trying out again, but these days it would pretty much be in 15mm."},
{"title": "Cavaliers and Roundheads - review", "date": "Wednesday, October 12, 2016", "text": "This is another review in the Once and Future Rules series, of wargame rules that are out of print, but that got a lot of play at one time (at least, in the clubs and groups I played in since the early 1980s).Keep your faith in God, but keep your powder dry.  - Oliver CromwellCavaliers and Roundheads is a set of rules for English Civil War wargames, published by TSR games.  It was written by Jeff Perren, but with the help of Gary Gygax.  The set I am most familiar with, and have played, and will be reviewing is the second edition, published in 1975.First, a bit of personal reflection...This is a great set of rules, that can serve for large wargames (or small, although the combat system's rate of attrition moves pretty fast for a small game), of the sort played at conventions and at wargames clubs.  Many years ago, I used to be lucky enough to play these rules at the wargaming shop where I played and worked, through my undergraduate college years - Campaign Headquarters.  Armies were of the \"hundereds of figures per side\" variety, sometimes reaching thousands.  Played on a great 6x12 table, with lots of great terrain (although some was clearly medieval - which could be forgiven in the case of stone churches and castles, less so in the case of thatched cottages).  These rules were definitely written with that sort of game in mind, and to be played in glorious 25mm (or 30mm, as the rules point out) - as a good friend of mine refers to - the \"one true scale\".I have a sizable collection of 25mm ECW figures myself, although (sadly) they are not painted.  Not-so-sadly, they are mostly of the Wargames Foundry variety (I bought them when Pendragon used to be the dealer here in the United States, and I loved swirling through their drawers of figures, looking for just the right castings).  That is a painting project I have been putting off for years, although relishing it in my mind.  Weird.What I do have, that I could use these rules for, is a decent sized collection of 15mm figures.  They would work fine, I think, and perhaps a solo game (or even a club game) is in the schedule for the near future.  As I mentioned in the review of Forlorn Hope, ECW (and perhaps, more generally, the entire Renaissance period) has been, and remains, one of my personal favorite wargaming periods.  I can't explain it, but I've always been drawn to the history, the uniforms, and the fighting tactics.  Over the many years I have been a wargamer, it has only been eclipsed, I think, by maybe Medieval, and/or Ancients as a personal favorite period.NOT from the rulebook, yet how could I resist?Scale and Turn SequenceAs mentioned the game is played, probably most commonly, and written for 25mm-30mm figures.  It can handle a smaller scale (say, 15-20mm).  Each figure represents 20 men, and the ground scale is not given.  All ranges and movement values are given in inches, for the two scales (listed, 20mm and 30mm).At the 30mm scale, Pikemen can move 6\", and Musketeers 9\".  Cavalry can move 12\".  There are, of course, other units, those are just given for a feel for the movement speeds.Long range, at 30mm, for a Musket is 24\", and for a Heavy Field Gun, 36\".  Pistols may fire a maximum of 6\"There are two possible turn sequences given.  First, there is the possibility for orders, and simultaneous move.  This appears to be pretty freeform, with both sides making a note of all movement, for each unit, and then it is interpreted, executed, and followed up by first Fire combat and then Melee comat.The second option for moving requires no orders (other than general orders of what turn reinforcements are to arrive, etc).  It is executed this way:Side \"A\" moves all infantry units.Side \"B\" moves all units.Side \"A\" moves all cavalry and artillery.Simultaneous fire, with all cannon fire first, then everything else.Surviving troops will then Melee, where applicable.Once this is complete, then it is repeated, with the two different sides alternating who is side \"A\".MovementAs mentioned, there is a simple movement chart with moves given for all unit types in inches, depending on what scale (20mm or 30mm) the game is being played in.  There is no charge move for infantry, but Cavalry and Lobsters can charge move (which is a double move) provided they (1) haven't done a charge move in the previous two turns, OR (2) have not moved at all on the previous turn.  Dragoons (and of course, Artillery) join Infantry in not being able to charge.Some interesting limitations on movement exist, as well.  While musketeers can freely move and change formation and facing on a single turn, Pikemen can only EITHER move, or change their facing on the same turn.  Also, firing units are limited in their actions, and the game requires reloading.  While cavalry with pistols who perform a caracole, will automatically reload their pistols, Musketeers must do this an action.  A musket armed unit can do two actions per turn - the three allowed are Move, Load, Shoot.  So if the unit moves, it can only either Shoot (if already loaded), or Load (if previously having shot).  If the unit stands in place, it can both Shoot and Load.  Light field guns can also do two actions per turn, but heavy field guns can only do one action per turn.  Other limits also apply, and there are straight forward terrain rules.ShootingMusket fire is very straightforward and simple.  Roll 1d6 per firing figure (two ranks can fire), and based on range then hits are scored on results of 4,5,6 for Short, 5,6 for Medium, and 6 for Long.  This is against formed foot (which means Pikemen).  Against cavalry, muskets and artillery all hits are halved.Artillery is more interesting.  Based on the type a gun, a number of dice are rolled.  A light gun rolls 4 dice, and a heavy gun rolls 3 dice.  Examine the individual dice scores.  At Long Range, the lowest scoring die is the number of hits delivered.  At Medium Range, the next lowest die is the result, and at Short Range, the third lowest die is the result.  I have always liked this system.There are rules for the carricole maneuver for cavalry with pistols (assume two pistols per figure, if the unit is close enough, and willing to perform the retrograde away, then the front two ranks of cavalry can each fire two pistols at the target unit...).  And there are rules for Hand Grenades.MeleeMelee is handled by consulting a simple table which gives you how many Ranks are fighting based on the figure type (Pikemen, 2 ranks; Cavalry, 1 rank; etc.).  Also, depending on the target you are rolling against, it gives you a number of dice per figure (ranging from 2 dice per man, down to 1 die per six men), and also the score that will kill figures.    A number of special cases and limitations round out this area of the rules.This is definitely a system that is related to the \"dice per element\" sort of combat adjudication mentioned already for both The Universal Soldier and also the WRG Wargames Rules 1685-1845. In this case, it is definitely a \"dice per figure\" variation, as with The Universal Soldier.  One of the possible criticisms of the rules are that there is no standardized basing (same criticism of Chainmail, although in both cases, I think that the rules were written as club rules first, and in the club they were played, most armies already existed, or there was an unspoken standard basing going on).MoraleThe morale rules are also, like the rest of the set, quite simple.  Roll 2d6, and score a 6 or higher to pass morale.  There are, of course, modifiers.  If a failure is rolled, then the unit retires.  Here you dice for movement (2d6 for 20mm, and 3d6 for 30mm), and also a dice for direction (straight back, or veer off 45 degrees to either side).  Rules exist for regaining control, and also for rolling to keep Cavalry from pursuit.ExtrasThere are rules for several optional areas like desertion, elite units, etc.  There is a nice, short section detailing typical units, some army sizes from famous battles, and a simple painting guide that would certainly get a newcomer going in the right (approximate) direction.Opinion and CommentsThese are simple, simple rules.  Perhaps that is why I enjoyed them (there is hardly anything here for a large group of gamers to argue about, and everyone can eventually make a great move or volley of fire).  They don't have the period specific detail of Forlorn Hope or other rules that I also enjoy for the period, but are straightforward enough for a complete neophyte in the time period to enjoy, as well as an old hand, if he doesn't turn his nose up at too much lack of details.  Keep in mind, that I feel these are written for large games (and that is how I most enjoyed them), and the detail is right on the money for that large sort of game.As mentioned, my 25mm ECW figures remain unpainted.  And yet . . . I do have a 15mm collection that is usable, and growing (meaning: more figures in the works, and on the painting schedule).  The basing dilemma could be solved here, since I use a basing standard that is not too far off something WRG-ish - meaning, that my pike and heavy infantry (billmen from the trained bands, for instance) are mounted on 40mm wide bases, with four figures per base.  My shot are mounted on 40mm wide bases, with three figures per base.   My horse are mounted either 2 or 3 figures per base (lighter horse, such as dragoons, are 2 per base; heavier horse like lobsters or chargers are mounted 3 per base), also on 40mm wide bases.Given my existing collection and basing, I would feel quite fine doing a game using those figures, and these rules.  Casualty markers would be fine here, probably nylon upholstery rings (my usual poison for 15mm casualty marking).  It could be a fine game.  Certainly one to compare to some of the other ECW rules I play, including Forlorn Hope, The Universal Soldier, and the upcoming (to be reviewed) 1644.Of course hosting a game with 300 or 400 25mm figures per side, with all the regular cast of ODMS club members playing, would be a fine thing as well.  But wigs, feathery hats, and Spaniels would have to be provided, for the players to really feel like they were in the Recent Unpleasantness."},
{"title": "Random Battlefield setup", "date": "Saturday, October 8, 2016", "text": "My recent review of Dominance included a nod to the random table layouts that the author includes in the rules set, as a pretty neat resource for gamers.  I remember back when I played some Dominance, I had two renaissance armies (one infantry based - Swiss, and one cavalry based - French), and my friend and I who played the rules would randomly select one of the table diagrams in the book, and then dice for initiative in setup, and for side of table.  We would do our best to lay out the terrain based on what pieces we had (pretty easy), and off the whole shooting match went.This got me to thinking, and looking around at different systems on blogs and in articles on random battlefield set up.Over at Warfare in Miniature, there is a system that the author (James M) devised that is basically a PDF with six pages in it.  First you dice for a page in the document (1-6).  Then you toss two percentage dice, to generate a number from 1-100.  Consulting the page you rolled up, you will find a grid, with 8x9 squares on it, and with the numbers 1-97 on spaces in the grid.  If you roll 1-97, then the space you rolled is the upper box of your wargames table.The orientation of the number, is the direction of \"north\" on your newly generated terrain area.  Green areas are forest, brown areas are hills. Red lines are roads, blue lines are rivers.  Green boxes are built up areas/fields.  Simple.Each space on the grid represents 2'x2' on the gaming table, so you will have a grid of 3 spaces (or 6 feet), by 2 spaces (or 4 feet) to lay out your table in.  So for each of the six pages there are roughly 97 tables, that is a total of 585 tables, or something mathy like that.  But, the remaining three chances (98,99,100) for each page are also accounted for - they are tables that have homogeneous terrain over the whole surface.Seriously, this is cool, try it out.  The article is Here.  The document is Here.Another system that exists (and there are a number) that uses cards for the battlefields is the most excellent Battle Finder system from The Perfect Captain. As always, the rulesets from The Captain are free, although donations to charity are recommended by the authors.Battle Finder is a complete campaign system, presented in a generic sense, although The Captain has developed some specialized adaptations for several medieval and renaissance games.  In short, you construct a campaign map (or scenarios in a linear or narrative campaign) using some easy to print out small cards, each of which has a nice 4x6 tabletop pictured on it.  Here are a few examples.The Battle Finder system allows these cards, individually, to be mounted on a map that replicates a hex grid (each space connects to six surrounding spaces).  An individual card, printed and cut out, looks like this:A most excellent system, and the campaign rules are terrific.This is another review in the Once and Future Rules series, of wargame rules that are out of print, but that got a lot of play at one time (at least, in the clubs and groups I played in since the early 1980s).Dominance is a set of Renaissance period (1494-1529) wargames rules written by Ian Wilson, copyright 1986, and published by Raider Games in 1986, and a second printing in 1988.  They are available, still, through Partizan Press.  I could not find too much contemporary information about Raider Games, except to say that at one time, in addition to Dominance, Raider also produced \"Napoleonic Rules for a Large Scale Wargame with Small Scale Miniatures\" by Peter Dennis and Cliff Knight, as well as \"American Civil War\" by the same authors.  They also produced a set of dark ages rules (\"Oshere's Helm\" by P.J. Duckworth) that I have never seen myself (I have seen the other two sets mentioned previously).In addition to Dominance, Ian Wilson has also more recently (2009 or so) published a number of rules and articles in Wargames Illustrated, and released a second set of Renaissance rules, dealing with Eastern Europe (1558-1699), called \"Husaria\" in 2003, printed by Caliver Books for The Pike & Shot Society.Dominance is a nice set of rules, based on the idea of Combat Factors, which then turn into (with random dice factors added in, and also tactical modifiers for situation) a number of Casualties inflicted on an enemy unit, determined by consulting a Casualty Table (I refer to this system as the Factors and Table method, although that seems pretty obvious).  This is how both Shot and Melee combat work.  This is very similar to a broad family of wargames, going back to (at least) earliest versions of the WRG Ancients wargames, but really (as in the case of the earlier reviewed AWI ruleset, Valley Forge) tracing back to the casualty tables that were in the earliest Kriegspiel wargames from the 19th century.For rules covering the Renaissance period, at a minimum, the George Gush rules (1976 - review of these coming soon) published by WRG use a similar system.  Both Gush and Wilson rely on a figure scale of 20 men per casting, and left over casualties are kept track of on paper.  A great modification of the rules (discussed more later, in the review on the Gush rules) is to use a d20 and each turn, after all whole figure casualties are removed, a d20 is rolled and compared to left over casualties.  If it is less than the number, then an additional figure is removed, but nothing is kept track of on paper from turn to turn.It will be interesting to see an analysis of the casualty chart here, with the one in the Gush rules, or the older WRG Ancients rules (a future review is also planned for these), but those will be presented in the later articles.Note that this system - the Factors and Table system - is very different from the systems presented by Donald Featherstone's War Games (1962), which are all of the \"roll 1 d6 per figure, and a casualty results on 5,6\" variety.  That is not a bad method, and countless permutations and improvements of it exist, including the previously reviewed WRG Wargames Rules 1685-1845, and also a version is in The Universal Soldier.  The Factors and Table system, however, is much less prone to the winds of luck, or fortune, or kismet - or whatever it is that wargamers are calling it these days, when you roll a handful of dice, and 80% of them come up with 6s.  Also, the adjudication of combat is much quicker, or at least it is once the players or umpire have mastered the Factors tables, and understand what the tactical pluses and minuses are for most common situations.  It still has some randomness, introducing the stochastic variable of a chance die roll, so all Fortuna is not missing from the process.One nice thing about the Factor and Table system as it is implemented here, is that the factors are based on Weapon System vs Troop Type.  Often it is troop type vs troop type (as in Might of Arms, War Cry and many other rulesets, to make their appearance here in reviews), with a modifier for weapons.  In this case, it seems to make sense to have the weapons themselves included.  Also, as the Author points out in notes at the end of the volume, many typical mixed weapon formations are accounted for, when they are nearly universal (like the practice of including zweihanders or polearms within the front ranks of a pike formation), are then accounted for in the combat factors of the dominant weapon system (in this case, Pike), so mixed units don't have to be accounted for in the rules - always a messy situation.Movement and Ranges are given in Inches, which is very nice.  The rules state a ground scale of 10 yards to the inch for 20-30mm figures, and 20 yards to the inch for 9-15mm (40 yards for 5/6mm).  However, having everything in inches in the combat and movement tables is a great blessing.  Given how much scale creep our 15mm figures have had since 1987, I think it is fair to say that they could be used with the 20-30mm ground scale, without too much cognitive dissonance.Otherwise the rules are pretty straight forward.  They are predicated on umpired play (they were written by Ian for a wargames campaign, which he umpired), and hence use rules writing, some rules for command and control (how to change orders, the effect of leaders on combat), and use simultaneous movement.  Given all that, the turn sequence is pretty straight forward - move, shoot, fight, morale.As mentioned, these compare very well to the George Gush Renaissance rules from WRG (originally).  Where Dominance really shines is that in narrowing the focus of the rules (Western Europe, chiefly the Southern or Italian Renaissance, in the years 1494-1529), a particular style of combat, troop types, and battlefield behavior are focused on.  This gives a tighter and more constrained set of rules than Gush presents (more on that in the later review), but it also means that the rules are shorter, to the point, and read and play easily.Given the tight focus of the rules, the army lists supplied in the book are fantastic, and really cover the breadth of the Italian Renaissance, as well as the early Wars of Religion.  The list of armies included is:Early EnglishLate EnglishFlorentineEarly FrenchLate FrenchHoly Roman EmpireSpanish Holy Roman EmpireIrishItalian Independent City StateMilaneseNeapolitanBorgia PapalPapalScottishEarly SpanishLate SpanishSwiss ConfederationVenetianThese are great, and are presented as a invariable core of troops, with a series of optional add on units, etc that have a points cost.  So an army would be at a minimum the core troops described as the Basic Force, but based on the value of the army (whether in a one time game, or due to some campaign factors), could have additional units, described as Reinforcements.The army lists in the volume that accompanies Gush is an incredible source of information and data about the armies of the time period, and the breadth of armies and options are much greater than presented here in Dominance, but again, I view that as a detriment.  The specific flavor of each army is preserved by the Basic Force.Finally, one more thing that the rules, as a wargaming guide, give to a gamer or referee of a campaign is a great set of 20 maps, each of a 4x6 wargames table, with a variety of typical terrain features.  This could be keyed to locations on a campaign map, or could simply be used with a d20 to determine a random battlefield (or reproduced on cards, and use in some sort of filing system for the campaign).  A very useful appendix in the rule book.All in all, I like Dominance, and have enjoyed playing it in the past.  For a modern gamer, the Factor and Table system, although in use in a lot of games, does not seem to be where modern rulesets are going.  More frequently, these days, there is the opposed die roll method, or the dice-per-figure system, but the older method is faster, and gives the schooled player (who has played the rules a few times) a good eye for how many casualties to account for in a situation.  This means that the player can make more educated decisions - always a good thing.  So they are a trade off - not as exciting and fast (and of course - the modern aversion to simultaneous movement), but great coverage of a specific period, and a \"scientific\" method for doing casualties.  A good ruleset, and a good benchmark against which to compare other, perhaps more popular, rulesets using similar mechanics."},
{"title": "Forlorn Hope - review", "date": "Friday, October 7, 2016", "text": "I had rather have a plain russet-coated Captain that knows what he fights for, and loves what he knows, than that which you call a Gentleman and is nothing else.- Oliver Cromwell, 1643 This is another review in the Once and Future Rules series, of wargame rules that are out of print, but that got a lot of play at one time (at least, in the clubs and groups I played in since the early 1980s).Cover for earlier edition, frontpiece for the 1991 editionForlorn Hope is a set of rules for English Civil Wargames, first published in 1987, that I have been quite fond of over the years, having played many times in 15mm with a variety of friends, especially in the old ODMS club, when it played at Campaign Headquarters, Gamer's Guild, and World's Best Comics.I currently own a copy of the 1991 printing of the rules, although there are newer editions.  My own set still handles quite well, and has not loosened up at all over the years.  It is a set, according to the design notes of Messrs. Berry and Wilkins, that was designed primarily for tabletop play, and based on tabletop experience, rather than a strict translation of space and time (as in a simulation).  I think it succeeds well.The units have five possible factors describing them:Arm - Infantry, Cavalry, Dragoons, ArtilleryClass - Veteran, Trained, EliteTactics - (Cavalry Only) Trotters (close and shoot), Gallopers (charge home)Order - Normal Order, or Open OrderRatio - (Infantry Only) The ratio of shot to pike, given in the terms of 2:1, etc.In addition, Artillery comes in different varieties (Ultra Light, Light, Medium), and troops can be in a number of different formations (but can change formation during the game).  Line, Column, Fire Stand (similar to the later Square formation), Cavalry Line, Cavalry Column, and March Column.With these factors, a great variety of different troops from the English Civil War period can be described.Units are under orders at any time during the game.  There are chances, based on a dice roll, to change orders (and it depends on what order you are in, and what you are changing to, that determines this - followed by a D6 roll to see success.The available orders are:Advance to Fire CombatAdvance to H-t-H CombatHoldRetreatScreenThe game has the following five steps in a turn sequence:Declaration and Reaction (new orders, leaders leave units, declare charges, etc)Movement (move, routers first, then charges, then other units)Fire Combat and ReactionHand to Hand Combat (first casualties determined, then reaction tests)Reaction and Rallying (situational morale tests, rally from rout or pursuit)Scale: Movement and Ranges are all given in Inches.  No ground scale is given (see the note on design above).  Figure scale is 1:33, so that a unit of 400 men would be 12 figures.Determining Combat FactorsThere is a single combat table, used for Shot or Melee, which is based on determining a Factor, and then cross indexing it with the number of figures involved.  Those are divided up into groups of 1,2,3,4,5, or 10 - and then a dice is rolled for each group.  The procedure is to go for as few (large) groups as possible, and then the dice roll gives you the number of casualties (based on a casualty table).  So, as an example, if you have 24 figures in an Infantry unit in melee combat.  You would look up its combat factor (which would be based on several things, but chiefly it's shot to pike ratio).  Once you had the factor, you would find that row on the casualty table, and then use the 10 column (rolling on it twice) and the 4 column (rolling on it once) to determine the number of casualties.  In that way, you rolled for 10+10+4, or 24 figures.  Casualties are in whole figures, no record keeping.A very satisfying set of rules that plays well, although it does have somewhat of an 80s feel to it, especially in the area of Reaction Tests, which are (if I recall) many, and with a half page of factors to consider for plus or minus to the target number.  Once you play a game or two, however, it becomes pretty quick to work through.Prognosis: I love these rules.  However, I found that it was difficult to convey what is going on to somebody who is not a fan of either ECW or Thirty Years War military history.  The different types of cavalry tactics, and the possibility of infantry units being of different ratios of pike to shot (note: you never change how many figures you have of either type, you just use what you have, but the ratio is all important for figuring out combat factors).  For those who get it, and like it, however - this is a great set of rules for the pike and shot period.  There is a Yahoo group that offers up some rules variants, including a lot of Thirty Years War information.Two army listsThe rules are also quite complete, for tabletop battles.  Not too much in the way of campaign information, but a wide variety of different armies, and rules on how to select your figures based on the army you choose.  This involves random dicing for things like Ratio and Class.  Again, very satisfying.One of my favorite periods, and one of my favorite rulesets.  Considering they are almost 30 years old, that is a good thing.“Our cruel and unrelenting Enemy leaves us no choice but a brave resistance, or the most abject submission; this is all we can expect - We have therefore to resolve to conquer or die: Our own Country's Honor, all call upon us for a vigorous and manly exertion, and if we now shamefully fail, we shall become infamous to the whole world. Let us therefore rely upon the goodness of the Cause, and the aid of the supreme Being, in whose hands Victory is, to animate and encourage us to great and noble Actions - The Eyes of all our Countrymen are now upon us, and we shall have their blessings, and praises, if happily we are the instruments of saving them from the Tyranny meditated against them. Let us therefore animate and encourage each other, and shew the whole world, that a Freeman contending for Liberty on his own ground is superior to any slavish mercenary on earth.”― George Washington[This is another review in the Once and Future Rules series, of wargame rules that are out of print, but that got a lot of play at one time (at least, in the clubs and groups I played in since the early 1980s).  This one is less like the others I have written, in that this set of rules is not one that I have played a lot, but I still find it (at least personally) influential.  I would like to discuss why.]The frontpiece - the cover is a lovely color version of the same painting,but mine has a big SALE sticker on itLet me start this by saying that I would be surprised to find gamers who are currently still playing Valley Forge.  However, I have fond memories of this ruleset, and it has a fascinating history (and conceptual lineage), so I would like to say a few things about it.This is from the set I own, which is Valley Forge, published in 1976 by TSR.  I purchased my set from a hobby store (the still operating Denbigh Hobby, in Newport News, Virginia) back around 1981, while I was in high school. This was in reaction to having purchased and painted maybe a dozen or so 25mm American War of Independence figures (probably Hinchliffe figures, but possibly Minifigs - they had come from open packages, and were repacked in plastic baggies, which made them much more affordable for my high school student budget).  A second edition (Valley Forge II) was published the same year by Dave Wesely, the Author of the rules, by himself.  I have never seen a copy of that edition.David Wesely - author of Valley ForgeThis is a set of rules that has (according to both the introduction written by Dave Arneson, and a blurb on Boardgame Geek) inspiration taken by the author, from a much older set of rules from the US Army, written in the 1880s by Lt. Totten.  These were based on the Kriegspiel rules.  A good history of wargaming from that time is found in a book chapter that I co-wrote on the history of combat models and simulation (1).  That source does not mention Totten, but it mentions some of the other developments that came out of the Kriegspiel rules in the 19th century.  Towards that end (rules based on Kriegspiel), the Valley Forge rules make perfect sense - they are a tabletop simulation of combat during the American War of Independence, with particular detail to the number of actions that can take place in a 1 minute turn.  Also, the (mostly) deterministic nature of combat is based on the number of casualties that a volley of fire, from 100 men, can result against a massed enemy infantry unit, at different ranges.  So, for instance, the movement and volley rates are given for infantry for a 1 minute turn.  An example - British infantry can fire 6 rounds with a Brown Bess musket, in a turn, if performing Rapid Fire.  An American Rifleman with a Kentucky Rifle can only fire once in the same period, but at a range of 25 inches (250 yards), will be 42x as likely to inflict a casualty.  The rules are not wholly deterministic.  There are some random factors, and also a method for determining the chance of a Probability based activity being successful. Why is this important?  Because it illustrates that rules designed to be a simulation (as all in the Kriegspiel family are) first, and a game second, will be excruciatingly detailed in things that are important for the simulation to show.  In the case of Kriegspiel, to allow Officers in training to make realistic decisions about battlefield conditions, based on how effective troops behave.  In the case of Valley Forge, it is to allow wargamers to see what the realistic behavior of the troops were on a Colonial American battlefield.  All games, especially wargames, are somewhat of a simulation - but equally, all simulations are based on abstract models.  Typically, it serves the community of gamers who will play a wargame to include more abstraction and introduction of random elements (dice, cards, etc) to make the game \"fun\" and to introduce a sense of chance that we like in our hobby pursuits.  Valley Forge has less of that, and is much more detail oriented - closer to a simulation, than a game (if you allow there to be a continuum). Some particulars of the rules - they are designed for 25mm figures; 1 turn is 1 minute; 1 inch is 10 yards; 1 figure represents 30 men.Here is the turn sequence -Referee gives information and messages to playersPlayers write ordersPlayers declare orders, perform initial volleys, and announce charges.Simultaneous movementEffects of fire are calculatedEffects on morale from movement and casualties are calculatedFinal volleys calculatedMelee is fought, if applicable, and results appliedThe referee may execute through steps 6-8, for isolated parts of the battlefield, before returning to the whole scene, if appropriate. So, a number of things that would turn off a modern gamer (simultaneous movement, order writing, requiring a referee, deterministic casualties, and realistic times to reload and fire artillery - many turns in between shots, for all but the smallest pieces).Okay, so why am I writing a review of a set that I never played in a club or at a convention, and only halfheartedly tried at home?  Because of the detail and research that David Wesely invested in his rules.  He was a graduate student in Physics at the time that these were put together, and he would go on to take a commission in the US Army and work at Aberdeen, and other places.  This certainly means he appeals to my Engineering Professor persona, but also a wargamer he appeals to my attraction to accurate military historical detail.  The musketry information, and other information in Valley Forge has been raided by yours truly over the years for rulesets I have put together myself, albeit with mechanics that were closer to a Game than to a Simulation (more random chance involved, and more abstract results).As a wargamer, I would prefer to play British Grenadier, or Black Powder, or any of a number of rules (including some coming up in this series of reviews, such as Koenig Krieg), but I have fond memories of Valley Forge.  Mostly because it was the first scholarly wargame I ever encountered, and also because of the tie to Kriegspiel type rules, and mostly because of the debt for the scholarship that I owe David Wesely.(1) Margaret Loper and CharlesD.

{"title": "WRG Wargames Rules 1685-1845 - review", "date": "Thursday, October 6, 2016", "text": "This is another review in the Once and Future Rules series, of wargame rules that are out of print, but that got a lot of play at one time (at least, in the clubs and groups I played in since the early 1980s).The version of the rules that I own (physically), and that I am reviewing here, are from July 1979.  There was evidently an earlier release that same year, and also a release in Australia (with a yellow cover).  But the version I have is dated July 1979, and pictured here.This is a 48 page book, and does a pretty thorough job of presenting a set of tabletop rules (no campaign rules, although they are hinted at) for the core of the horse and musket period.  While written for anything from 6mm up through 30mm figures, most of the games I have played, or watched, have been either 25mm (the majority) or 15mm (a close second).The topics covered by the rules, and the table of contents are as follows:IntroductionMethod of play and time, ground, and troop scalesTroop types, basing, organization and valuesChoosing terrain and setting up a battleWeather, time of day, and visibilityFormationsOrders, command and controlPlaying EquipmentSequence of PlayReaction TestsSteadiness and OrderMovementShootingHand-to-Hand CombatCasualties, damage to property and engineeringPrisoners and victorySuggested wargames units for Marlburian, Seven Years and early Indian WarsBibliographyMiscellaneous InformationThe troop scale of the rules is 1:50 for the infantry, and 1:40 for the cavalry.  Ground scale is 1 inch to 25 paces (so, 40 inches for a mile).Training and Morale classes are divided up between Regulars and Irregulars.  Regular classes include Elite, Veteran, Trained, and Raw.  Irregular include Fanatics, Soldiers, Warriors, and Levies.Troop types are, of course, based on employment and equipment -CuirassiersHeavy CavalryLight CavalryIrregular CavalryLine InfantryLight InfantryIrregular Charging InfantryIrregular Skirmishing InfantryEngineers and PioneersMounted InfantryWar ElephantsTransportStaffAnd a small constellation of artillery types (different weights, rockets, and different mobility types - such as foot, horse, elephant)Basing figures is based on a rather typical WRG 60mm wide base for 25-30mm figures.  Infantry get 4 figures per stand, and cavalry get 3 figures per stand.  In both cases, fewer figures are used for irregular units, for instance.  The basing of typical infantry and cavalry as (respectively) 4 and 3 figures is extremely helpful in combat, as shooting and fighting are done in those increments.A point system is given for competition games, and pickup meeting engagement.  Rules for terrain selection and battle setup (entry sequencing, off table troops, flank marches, etc) are included.Troops can adopt a number of different formation (column, line, square, skirmishing) depending on the troop type. Order writing is addressed - and pointed out (in the text, as well as in the introduction) that these rules require no order writing because of their turn sequence. Which brings us to:Sequence of Play (alternating between players)Response PhaseShooting PhaseHand to Hand Combat PhaseManeuver PhaseThis is an interesting turn sequence, mull over it for a second.  You start moving charges, and other moves, at the end of your turn, at the last phase.  At the start of the next turn, your opponent then immediately rolls for reactions, and his troops may have a response to your charge.  Once that is done, you complete your charge.  Then comes shooting, fighting, and regular maneuvers.Okay, enough with all that jazz.  There are specifics on turning, marching, expanding, taking reaction tests and all that.  But the thing that keeps these rules fun, and still have a following , is the method for determining shooting and melee casualties.  When a unit engages the enemy it gets to roll a certain number of d6.  Usually this is 1 per 4 figures for infantry, and 1 per 3 figures for cavalry.  This is why those stand sizes make sense.  For shooting, cross index the type of weapon (musket, medium artillery, etc) and range, vs. the target disposition.  That can be a dense target (such as the flank of an infantry formation), or a normal target, or a covered target etc.  The table then gives you the results, on 1d6, for which numbers will produce a Hit.  In some cases, there are multiple hits from a single dice, if the right target number is rolled.  Easy. I refer to this as a \"dice per element\" system, which is different from the \"dice per figure\" system that Universal Soldier uses.Example: Musketry from regular infantry, at up to 100 paces (4 inches) will roll 1d6 per four figures firing (so, say a 16 figure infantry battalion, representing 800 men, would roll 4d6).  The table for the weapon at that range, vs. a Normal target, says \"2345H 6HH\" - that means on each dice, if it is a 2,3,4 or 5 it causes one hit (a dead figure), and if it is a 6 it causes two hits (two dead figures).Melee is very similar (you roll the same number of dice), but the matrix for determining hits is very much simplified for melee combat.  That table compares the fighting troops, and breaks it down to: Mounted vs MountedMounted vs FootFoot vs. MountedFoot vs. FootFor each of those lines on the Hand-to-Hand combat table, there are three columns - if you are at Disadvantage, if you are on Equal Terms, or if you have an Advantage.  There is a method for determining whether or not you have advantage, but in my experience from years ago, in 99% of cases, it is obvious (once you work through the method a few times).  If you have to figure it out, then there are points to add up and compare.  It is possible that a unit is advantaged to a foe it is fighting, on the front, for instance, but disadvantaged against another foe on its own flank.  It all works out.Then you roll the dice, and the table tells you, again, how many hits you score for a dice toss.  For instance, Foot vs. Foot, on equal terms, will score \"456H\" - which means on a 4, 5 or 6 on the dice, one enemy Foot figure is killed.  Mounted vs. Foot, with advantage, is deadly.  The results are \"23HH 456HHH\" Which means on a 2, or 3, each dice rolling that number will kill two enemy figures, but on a 4,5, or 6 each dice rolling those numbers will kill three enemy figures.Interesting odds and bits on engineering rules, and how to treat structures, officers, and prisoners round out the rule book.There is a reason these are still played by some people, and hated by others.  There is a lot in these rules to reaction tests, which may or may not be your thing.  The fact that there is no simultaneous movement is a bonus.  And the combat adjudication is simplicity itself, once you get the hang of figuring out advantage.  They do, however, tend to bring out some extreme gamesmanship (i.e. - min-maxing?) that I have only seen topped with Napoleon's Battles.  But that is a different story.Several supplements have come out over the years that are useful.  One of the best is a set of 18th century army list rules that I have, from the Cheltanham Wargaming Assocation.These offer up a number of rules, and hint at some changes for linear warfare.  The cover everything from Marlburian up to Revolutionary armies (both American and French).Later on WRG themselves produce Seven Years War army lists, with actual (official) changes to the rules to accommodate linear warfare better.  It seems that the rules themselves are more suited to Napoleonic warfare (being more fluid).I don't have the 7YW army list book, so I can't compare them to the Cheltenham book.  Equally, I never got a copy of the Tabletop Games 1:50 Napoleonic Army List book, which also was widely touted for use with the rules reviewed above.My opinion?  I like them.  I like the mechanics.  But I also very much like the Tac50 rules from Ben King covering the same period, and they play easily as fast, with easier to navigate text and reaction rules.  Maybe these need a replay.  Maybe not.  I understand there is a modern version, for free on the internet, called ELAN that are a refinement of the WRG rules.  That deserves a look."},
{"title": "The Universal Soldier Miniature Rules - review", "date": "Wednesday, October 5, 2016", "text": "This is the first review in the Once and Future Rules series of retro rules reviews.  This is a review of a set of miniatures rules called \"The Universal Soldier\".This is a ruleset, published by RAFM in 1977, and authored by John Lain, Colin McClelland, and Paul Sharpe.  It is a set of rules for tabletop battles, covering the ancient through renaissance period.  The rules cover situations of movement, shooting, combat and morale.  The table of contents from the book is:IntroductionCommandThe UnitMovementCombatMissile FireArtilleryMoraleControlFatigueSpecial Weapons and TacticsTerrainGlossarySummary of ChartsAppendixThe scale for the game is not really important, as everything is done at the figure level, but is described (briefly) in the introduction at being roughly 1 figure = 10 men. A ground scale is not given, but all ranges and movement are in inches.  The rules are designed for 25mm play, but I have participated in 15mm games using these rules, unmodified, and they work just fine.The rules are written around the concept of using written orders, and I have played games that both used, and didn't use orders.  It adds a level of fun to the game, but also opens up some area of conflict.  For solo play, of course, written orders are not really useful, but the system from Charles Grant's solo wargames book to partially randomize the behavior of one side or the other would be useful.The turn sequence, given in the book, if using orders is as follows:Write Tactical Orders for this TurnAnnounce ChargesPerform Changes of Formation and FacingPerform Disorganized WithdrawalAll other movement is simultaneously performedMissile FireCombatRecord Missile Use (ammo) and Accumulated FatigueFigures are to be based on stands, which the authors recommend using a 2 inch front on a base that has three infantry, or two cavalry.  That isn't bad, and is comparable to a 60mm front (for instance) with three infantry or two cavalry, if one wants to use a WRG standard.  The authors mention that for 15mm figures, the rules are usable as-is, but reducing the stand size.Stands are then organized into units, and each unit has several characteristics.  First it has an attack rating (A-E),   a defend rating (A-E), a Morale Group (I-VI) and a Morale Point (typically 5,6 or 7), some weapons, and a description of the Unit Order (Regular, Horde, Skirmish, or Independent).  Finally, there is a Control Point which is a target number to determine if a unit Pursues enemy or not.The Defend Rating is related to the armor that the unit wears, and that determines movement rate.  Cavalry are all rated A,B,C, or D.  Infantry are all rated C, D, or E.  One pet peeve - all moves are multiples of 3\" (3,6,9,12,15), except for D rated infantry, which move 4\" as a standard move, and 8\" as a charge or road move.  I prefer (personal taste) to have all moves based on a similar multiple (either all multiples of 2,3,4 etc).Units may be ordered to do a Forced move, which is the same as a charge move, or road move.  It incurs a Fatigue point.Unit type (Regular, Horde, Skirmish, etc) determines what maneuvers may be done, in terms of evolution, wheeling, expanding, etc.Combat is done at a per figure level, in spite of having everything based on stands.  Compare the Attack rating of one unit vs the Defend rating of the other, and a chart then gives you the number of dice per figure to roll, and the range that produce a casualty.  Usually you are rolling one dice per figure, but in really disparate match ups (great quality troops, vs unarmored foes, for instance) you might roll more dice per figure (2,3,4 or even 5 dice per figure), or you might only roll 1/2, 1/3 or fewer dice per figure.  All hits are kills.  I would refer to this type of combat system as a \"dice per figure\" system, vs many others that are \"dice per element\" (where element can refer to a stand, or a number of stands, of multiple figures).Shooting is similar, with Artillery having a chance to have the hit drift around on the battlefield.Morale triggers are from casualty levels, and situational (charge on flank, etc).  The morale group gives any non-standard trigger categories (for instance, Morale Group VI must make a test whenever they are ordered to do formation change, presumably because they are trained so poorly).  the morale point is the target number, rolled against on 2d6, with modifiers added in or subtracted.Rules for control exist, to see if a unit looses control after a melee (for instance).Rules for fatigue exist, for doing forced marches, or from fighting melee or routing.  Units that accumulate so many fatigue points lose some of their attack rating, or worse.There are rules for special weapons and terrain, and a nice wrap up with examples.The appendix gives a good description of all the fighting ratings (attack and defend) and offers up a list of weapons and a point system.  Finally, there is a list of historical armies, and what the ratings are for the common troop types in those armies.It is a nice, complete ruleset.  As mentioned, the only problem with solo play is the reliance on written orders, but that can be worked around.  After re-reading these rules, and reminiscing, I think it might be time to break out The Universal Soldier for a solo game - maybe 15mm renaissance?Note: There are some other fantasy rules from RAFM, much more modern, that have as part of the title the phrase \"The Universal Soldier\" - I have not seen those."},

{"title": "Medieval Wargaming at Guns of August", "date": "Tuesday, August 30, 2016", "text": "[ODMS has held it's 2016 Guns of August convention.  The convention was in a location, and while the gaming and other activities were better than ever, there were some problems with the location (hotel).  Rumor has it that they are looking for somewhere else for the Williamsburg Muster in February of 2017.]At the recent Guns of August convention, I hosted an event called \"Introduction to Medieval Wargaming\".   It was an event where I referee'd two different Medieval battles, using the Neil Thomas rules, Ancient and Medieval Wargaming.  The rules are available from Amazon, and a host of other locations, and provide a great introduction to the period. The Neil Thomas book is divided up into four sections, with Biblical, Classical, Dark Ages, and Medieval making up the sections.  Each has background, historical notes, specific rules, and army lists.For this event, I chose the Dark Ages chapter for my two games.  Some might argue that the Dark Ages are not medieval, but I would argue otherwise.The first battle was between Vikings and Welsh (I adapted the army list for Picts/Scots for the Welsh).Viking Army - players: Gisselle and Bill2x units of Huscarls (with Berserkers in the units)4x units of Bondi (each with one stand of archers)2x units of ThrallsWelsh Army - players: Alex and John1x unit of Mounted Nobles1x unit of Light Horse4x units of Shieldwall Infantry1x unit of Huscarls (viking mercenaries)1x unit of ArchersThe vikings were quite aggressive.  At one point, a unit of Huscarls even got close enough to charge the Welsh Nobles (mounted).  Due to this aggressiveness, and also some very lucky combinations of dice throws (good for the Vikings, bad for the Welsh) it was a sound, and quick, Viking victory.  However, I believe that the players really enjoyed the game, and the armies.  All of the players were miniatures gamers, and medieval gamers, but none had played the Neil Thomas rules before.  It was a fun ruleset for them, but (for experienced players) it was extremely light and missed some things they thought should have been present in such a ruleset.  Still, the simplicity and speed of play was appreciated.  For armies of this size (8 units is standard), two players per side is really only suitable in a learning situation.  One player is perfect for 8 units, in these rules.The second battle (although both were played simultaneously, while I refereed) was between Carolingians and Moors.  This would have been something similar (although on a much reduced scale) as the battle of Tours, or one of the battles between Charlemagne's descendants and an encroaching Muslim army out of Spain.  (truth in advertising: my Carolingian knights were actually Normans, so they had kite shields.  If they had sported round shields, they would have been much more accurate, but I have several dozen stands of Norman knights, and often use them for western knights/heavy cavalry for this period regardless of the army).Carolingian Army4x units of Carolingian Knights1x unit of Retainers (light cavalry)2x units of Shieldwall Infantry1x unit of ArchersMoorish Army2x units of Nobles (elite heavy cavalry)2x units of Moors (heavy cavalry with bow)1x unit of Jinettes (light cavalry)2x units of Spearmen1x unit of ArchersHere (and I apologize for not recording the names of the players), one of the players (the Carolingian) was an experienced medieval player, and the other (the Moor) was completely new to any wargaming other than WW2 skirmish games (he is new to the hobby).  It went pretty well, and both appreciated the rules.  The experienced player liked the streamlined rules, and how quickly they played, and the new player liked how the different unit types had different stats, but it all worked well together as a system.The battle went well, and was extremely close.  There were several amazing cavalry clashes, and the inexperienced player had an army that requires a little bit of finesse, but he still performed well.  The Infantry on both sides ended up fighting opposing cavalry as much as opposing infantry.  A good fight, and it came down to the last dice roll (the last turn could have seen either side win, with the right luck, but it was slightly weighted towards the Carolingians).  The Moors lost, but only barely.It was a successful event, exposing some fun, fast rules, teaching and discussing little history, learning from the players, and watching the excitement of contested battle lines.  In short, medieval wargaming."},
{"title": "Solo Miniatures Game: Clontarf 1014!", "date": "Sunday, May 8, 2016", "text": "Having recently rebased and reorganized my dark ages collection, it is time to host a game with the figures.  Much of what I have in that collection falls into five categories.Vikings - many figures are clearly vikings, as depicted by shield and banner designs.Normans - a decent sized Norman, or West Frankish, collection.  Could also be early Germans (i.e. Carolingian East Franks - Alemagne, Saxons, Austrasie, Baviere, etc)Saxons - armed like the Vikings, with with the Christian motiffs suspected in Alfred's kingdom, etc.Irish - The Irish are definitely the Irish, you can tell by their odd shaped shields.Generic - There are many, many fellows wearing a chainmail byrnie, with a round shield (or sometimes, occasionally, a kite shield sneaks into a group), and a variety of weapons.  They are not immediately identifiable as Irish Nobles, Saxon Fyrd, Viking Thegns, etc - but could be any/all of the above.One battle I would like to fight is Clontarf, pitting the High King (Ard Ri), Brian Boru, against the rebellious  Leinster King, Mael Mordha, and his viking mercenaries.  Mael Mordha was also allied to Sigtrygg Silkbeard - the Viking king of the city of Dublin (a Viking settlement, as prior to the Vikings building up towns, Ireland did not really have any).  While the armies were not so very different, at some levels, in composition - it is tempting to think of Brian's army as \"Irish\" and Mael Mordha's army as \"Viking\" - but the truth is that the Vikings had been in Ireland for two centuries, and had strongly influenced Irish warfare.ResourcesA fantastic resource about Brian Boru, his rise, the battle, the sides, and the results is at the online gallery hosted by Trinity College, in Dublin.  The presentment at the College, during the 1000 year anniversary in 2014, must have been fabulous.  Here is an example of one of the outstanding paintings commissioned for the various chapters of Brian's life and the retelling of the battle:From the time, we know about the battle from near a half dozen different places.  The first three are \"annals\" that were being composed at the time, and they all mention (to different extents) the battle.Annals of UlsterAnnals of Inisfallen Annals of the Four MastersNext, there is Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh, or the history of the \"War of the Irish with the Foreigners\".  Finally, there is Njal's Saga, which has towards the end, a description of the book.A great map of the battle appears in History of Ireland, in an article by Sean Duffy.  It shows the key occurrences of the battle.Seán Duffy, 'What happened at the Battle of Clontarf?' in History Ireland, vol. 22, no. 2 (2014), pp 30-1: 31.Aside from their fantastic online gallery about Brian Boru, Trinity College also has a fantastic online gallery about the Battle itself, and it will have much more information than I can recreate here.The BattleThe battle itself was fought on Good Friday, April 23, in the year 1014.  The two sides, as mentioned, were Brian's army, and the Viking alliance against him.The Viking alliance against Brian's army had four chief commanders.  First, was Sigtrygg Silkbeard - the Viking leader of the Hiberno-Norse settlement/town of Dublin.  Allied with him was Mael Mordha, the king of Leinster.  Their Viking mercenary compatriots were commanded by Brodir of the Island of Man, and Sigurd of Orkney.  Between them they had about 6,600 men, although 2,000 (the Vikings of Orkney and Man) had freshly landed for the battle.  Sigtrygg (who was, by the way, married to Brian's daughter) and Mael Mordha (whose sister, Gormflaith, was Brian's third wife) were in revolt against Brian, the High King of Ireland.  There is some legend about Mael Mordha being mad about losing a chess game.  The Vikings of Orkney and Man were fighting under a Raven Banner that was stitched for Sigurd of Orkney by his mother Eithne.  There is a great set of commemorative stamps (with art by Victor Ambrus), celebrating these personalities and their history, described in Frontiers Magazine.Brian Boru was High King due to having subjugated Connaught, Munster, and both parts of the Ui Neill land - in short, most of Ireland.  Added to that, Leinster was a vassal land, although ruled over by Mael Mordha.  Brian Boru's army consisted of about 5,000 men.  These consisted of about 2,000 Munster men, and the rest split between Connachts and Dalcassians.  The Dalcassians represented Brian's tribe (which in modern days also gave us John F Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan), which is where he got his start as a leader around the mouth of the river Shannon.  The Connachts were men from Connaught.Brian's men set up north and west of the Viking line.  The Vikings were spread between the shoreline and the Tolka river.  The Vikings of Orkney and Man were at the front, and the Leinster men under Mael Mordha were on a second line.Here is an interesting 19th century map, interpreting what comes to us from the primary sources.The Battle itself was a blood bath - with almost all the Vikings having been slain, and a good 25% of Brian's army.  It was a victory for Brian, except that after the battle while Brian was praying in his tent (and taking a rest - he was 84 years old at this time), Brodir of Man snuck into his tent, and murdered him.  Brodir was chased down by Brian's men, and put to justice.  Other than the many men, one of Brian's sons and several other relatives also died during the battle.I plan to recreate it using 15mm miniatures.  Pictures of the battlefield and miniatures to follow in another post."},

{"title": "Recent Miniatures Projects", "date": "Saturday, April 23, 2016", "text": "At GwC headquarters, recently there has been a lot of work going on at my miniatures workbench.  I have been painting and rebasing large quantities of my 15mm collection, and have started painting on some 28mm projects.First, starting really before Christmas, and only finishing sometime during the winter convention season (re: MarsCon and Williamsburg Muster), I had rebased and flocked my Mexican American War collection.  This amounted to about 2000 miniatures, mostly infantry (although a decent amount of Mexican cavalry), rebased from cardboard and balsawood onto MDF bases, of the variety I usually purchase from resellers like GaleForce9 at wargames shows.  I have, in a manner very similar to many of my other 15mm age of rifles armies, based the infantry on 25mm square stands, with three miniatures per stand, and the cavalry on 30mm square stands, with two miniatures per stand.  The guns are on 40mm bases, with crew.  I have not hosted a game (solo or otherwise) with this collection yet, although this rebasing project is complete, because I needed to finish up some suitable terrain in 15mm.  All my adobe/desert style terrain is in 28mm for The Sword and the Flame, and most of it has a distinct middle eastern flavor (some could swing to Mexico or California, but not all).Second, I had interrupted my projects with a really satisfying game of Renaissance, using the Neil Thomas rules, and my figures for the Italian Wars (covered in this blog here and here).  A very satisfying game, but at the time I did not do anything to rebase that collection of Renaissance figures.  That could be a project in the future, and would make them compatible with other figures that I have for the period.Third, I have begun a large project of rebasing and organizing my Dark Ages figures.  This is chiefly figures for four armies - Vikings (very large collection), Saxons, Normans, Welsh and Irish - recently added to my collection.  This allows a large variety of different battles and campaigns to be waged, but it also adds to an already decent sized collection of Vikings and Western Franks (Normans) that I had already owned.  Again, the rebasing is an attempt to bring a uniformity to the combined collection, and because I really prefer my own mix of flocking and MDF bases.  Here are a couple of pictures of figures from the new addition to the collection, in process (recently glued to the new bases, but not flocked yet).New figures based - old bases on the slingers at the top rightIn the first picture (above) you can see about seven units of figures, assuming 6 bases per unit.  Some of the units in the collection are this size, some larger, but it is very flexible, as there is very little to differentiate units, except for armament and some national characteristics in shield design, clothing, etc.  For instance, the three units in the upper left could be used for just about anything (Irish Bonnachts, Welsh, Saxon Great Fyrd), but were included with the Irish figures.  The presence of a priest and some of the banner designs indicate a Christian nationality.  On the other hand, the figures in the other units of the picture could just as handily serve as either Saxons or Vikings.  And considering, for instance at some of Brian Boru's battles (such as Clontarf), there is little difference between the Vikings on either side of the battlefield, these could also serve in an Irish army.  Notably, the Welsh also employed Vikings in their ranks as well.The buildings in the picture feature on their bases my own mix of flocking.  It is made from a mixture of two different colors/grades of woodland scenic turf, and then has some small amounts of foliage mixed in, and some ballast to represent rocks.  I have been using a variant of that mixture since the late 1980s, off and on.The old style of bases in the collection I recently acquired are pictured here, in the upper right of the picture.  It is a thin balsa style base, with a dark green grass used as flocking.  This is the same style that was employed in the Mexican American War collection, and also the Renaissance collection (they are from the same painter).  The style is good, and the look en masse is fine, it is just not what I prefer to use.  And rebasing gives me an excuse to spend time at the workbench, while listening to music and enjoying a pipe, so why not?  Below are some more pictures of the figures in progress.[A word on the painting style - it is very different from my own.  These figures were painted with a white primer base under all the figures, and it leads to figures that have a very light look, overall, compared to my painting.  I will try to post some pictures of my own 15mm dark ages figures, in comparison, very soon.  I usually go for black primer, with white dry brush over it, and then paint in sold block colors, adding washes and detail last.  These seem to have a lot of wash style color areas added, which have a very good effect at a wargames table distance, and give a very colorful appearance to the army. It is just a different effect from my own figures.  I don't think the soldiers will mind, at all, being on the same battlefield, however.]Very nice mixture of poses and manufacture - but I suspect a lot of Splintered LightCloseup showing bases, wet glue(!) and figures.  Nice job on the banner!I will be playing a solo game, very soon, as soon as the last of the Dark Ages figures are completed and off the gaming table (I rebase on the gaming table, and flock at the painting table - a sort of assembly line).Considering that the theme for the Guns of August convention this summer is Medieval Battles, this collection should definitely be seeing some action at the convention.  I am considering a big multi-player Battleaxe-Blitz!  Details to follow, but think of a large many-factions Duke Siefried style game.  It seems proper.In addition to the 15mm dark ages collection, I recently started painting some 28mm Foundry viking characters to use for SAGA and Lion Rampant as leaders.  Speaking of SAGA - this past year's Williamsburg Muster had some really great SAGA games going on, I really need to get an army finished up.  Here is a picture of Glenn from the Richmond Leisure Society, having a great time.Great looking figures, Glenn.  I hope to put some of my own out there (I have a decent sized collection of older Ral Partha 25mm vikings, and such, but I really want to get my Foundry, Crusader and Old Glory figures painted - I have had them since Georgia, and keep putting them off).I will most likely be missing Historicon this summer (although I do plan to be at RavenCon, playing some RPGs and boardgames, at the end of April).  The reason for that is because of my Daughter's schedule - summer camps and college preparation activities (she is in 11th grade, and deep in the process of picking a school for after she graduates).  Considering I have such a great time with her, it takes all the sting out of missing Historicon, but it means that I am deeply involved in getting prepared for Fall In as my next major (non-ODMS) convention.Time with my daughter, the best reason to miss out on gaming conventionsIn preparation for Fall In, I am working on two painting projects.  The first (to be detailed in a later blog entry) is 28mm Napoleonic British.  This will be my first Napoleonic project using plastic figures.  I am using the Warlord figures, and they are great to work with.  More details and pictures later.  The second project is getting ready for a Hail Caesar game.  This entails two things - getting my Early Imperial Roman figures rebased from individual mounts (used for Warhammer Ancient Battles) to group stands (4 men on a 40x40 base, for the formed infantry) that will be useful for a variety of different rules, including Hail Caesar (and still quite useful for WAB).  The second, and more exciting thing, is getting some Celtic units ready for a large Briton's army.  I am, again, using plastics for this (because I have the figures stockpiled already, and I have been *meaning* to get around to painting them for about 7 or 8 years now).  The first up are some Wargames Factory cavalry.  Here are some pictures of the figures I have assembled.  Yes, I know, I should have painted the riders and horses separate, but I really wanted to see what the assembled figures looked like, and I got carried away.  I think they look splendid!Yes, you can see the gory details of the painting table, but the figures look absolutely splendid.  Can't wait to get paint on them.  Expect to see more pictures of them, once completed, here at Gaming with Chuck."},
{"title": "Solo Campaign Idea", "date": "Thursday, March 24, 2016", "text": "In thinking about a solo campaign, I am of a mind that many of the actions that one would want to do in a wargaming (military) campaign should be adjudicated through some stochastic method - a dice chance, or probability chance - of success.  This keeps too much mono-thought and knowledge of what the other side (i.e. - the same player - me) is thinking, from creeping into the calculus of what a turn consists of.  If every action has to be diced for, then there is necessarily a layer of artificial constraint introduced that will keep actions from always being successful.Okay, enough philosophy of solo game design.  Here is my idea.  Have a map, based on point-to-point movement, which is marked up with a number of key pieces of information. Initially, I am thinking that the information would be numbers reflecting the chances of completing a military move, and also of recovering casualties and recruiting new figures.  Here is an example of what I am thinking of.On this map, the hexagons represent campaign locations.  The castle symbols represent either cities or fortified areas (the actual symbols used would be based on what time period, and what sorts of locations are important to know about for that time period).  The black numbers are the difficult of completing a move along that route.  If you decide to try and move an army from location G to location H, for instance, you see that the route has a \"9\" marked on it.  That means, in this simple example, that if you roll 2d6, and score 9 or less, then the move is successful.  Sea routes are also marked - notice the score along the river between B and E, and the score along the coast between E and J.  The Anchor symbol represents that the location has access to water based movement along the waterway that the anchor is connected to.So much for movement.  But the locations on the map are also marked with pairs of red numbers under each.  Those represent two things - the first is the chance to recover troops.  This could be a chance to recover lost stands from a unit, after a battle.  Again, this is based on a roll of 2d6 or less.  The numbers used are purely for example and discussion in this article, but the numbers I used are 8 in regular locations, 10 in population centers (cities), and 6 in ports (or economic centers, but none were marked on this map), where I reasoned that there are more demands for work would mean it is harder to recruit men to serve in a unit.  The second number is the chance to recruit a whole unit if it is available to an army to recruit such a unit.  Limits could arise from the tactical rules used (i.e. - in some games, and army only consists of a maximum number of units), or could be introduced as part of the campaign (each leader is given an Operations rating, which represents the maximum number of units he may have under his control).This system could easily be expanded by introducing resources (gold, food, ore, magic, etc) to represent the particular time period.  Different types of routes could be introduced (rail lines, which would also have a number representing how difficult it would be to plan a military move over a stretch of rail).  By having different routes, different rules on how many different types of moves a unit could make, could be introduced.That brings me to the last point - action points.  I was originally thinking something like 3 action points.  It would cost 1 point to move one segment by land, and 1 point to try to recover a lost stand to a unit, but all 3 points to try and recruit a new unit, and maybe 1/2 point to move by a sea route.  In this way, if using a 2d6 system to adjudicate actions, then if rolling a 2, one would have a critical success, and would be able to recover an additional action point to use this turn.  If rolling a 12, it would mean abysmal failure in planning, and no additional action points may be spent that turn.Finally, the added element might be characters, or rulers.  I always liked the idea, based on the original Tony Bath concept, of having all the major characters in a campaign nation to be developed.  This was done in very nice way in the board game Blood Royale, many years ago, and also in many miniatures campaign systems.  One of the things by having a dice based campaign system, is that some characters might be better at some actions vs others, not to mention skills at tactical combat (either command bonuses, or combat bonuses).  For instance, Lord Whistlebird is a harsh tyrant, but a bit of a coward. He gains a +1 bonus to target numbers when trying to organize a march (he pushes the men into a forced march), but gets no bonus from being in combat with a unit.Many possibilities are here with even such a simple system.  I think I might put together a map, and try it out with the Renaissance troops."},
{"title": "Italian Wars wargame (pt 2)", "date": "Tuesday, March 22, 2016", "text": "In part 1 I talked about the game I set up, along with the army lists.  This was a game, set in the 1490s, between a rather generic French force, and a rather generic Italian force.  In looking at the history a little closer, and also looking at the units in the armies (from the lists by Neil Thomas, in Wargaming: An Introduction) I think it is fair to say that a good inspiration for the army lists that I settled on could have been representative of the Battle of Fornovo (July 6 1495, near the city of Parma).Battle of FornovoThe Battle of Fornovo was fought between the forces of Charles VIII (of France) and the Republic of Venice, with help from the Duchy of Milan and the Margravate of Mantua.In my case, rather than having a river extend between the two armies, I had it run down the table, from the Italian side of the battle field to the French.  The battlefield looked something like this:The battlefield, using new Terrainguy tiles, purchased from HalWith a couple of hills, and a cross roads.  There are some small patches of woodlands, and the villa to the right side of the table.  In the image, the Italian army is set up at top, and the French army at the bottom of the picture.The battle opened up, with a turn of maneuver, and then the two battle lines were within artillery range of each other.  The French army had two modern (for 1495) pieces of artillery, and the Italians had an older, mid 15th century, bombard.  The French artillery was used, to good effect, against one of the units of Italian Gendarmes.  The Italian Bombard blew up.  Yes, the first time it was attempted to be fired, the Italian bombard exploded.The Neil Thomas rules play very fast, and since there is no order writing, or maneuver planning, it is pretty well suited for solo play.  With the very simple army list and troop type structure, and no points values, with a system for recruiting and some map maneuver, it might form  a great basis for a solo campaign. The Swiss Pike - 2 units, 6 stands eachThe Swiss, in this period, are fierce - they have to advance towards the enemy each turn, but do not have to take morale checks while in melee combat (which means they fight to the slow, terrifying death). In these rules, morale checks for losing a base reflect the dwindling resolve of the unit - for each failed morale check, another base goes away.  Since infantry units have only 6 bases, taking a loss of one base to Melee casualties, and then failing a morale check to lose another, means you've lost 1/3 of your combat effectiveness.  It is worse if you take more than one stand loss in a turn.The Italian Shot, armed with crossbow, inbetween the swordsmen and the Italian pikeThe French cavalry in this army are divided up between two types - Gendarmes (typical, high morale, and extremely well armored in plate mail and metal barding for the warhorses), and also a cavalry type known as Mounted Bow.  Evidently, following the Hobilars of the earlier (100 Years War) period, the French still experimented with mounted archers. But by the time of the Italian Wars, the units still existed within the army, but they no longer carried their bows into combat, preferring instead to fight as second rate Gendarmes (something akin to a medieval Sergent).  The French Army, according to Mr Thomas' rules, can also include some mounted crossbow, but I did not include them in this battle.French cavalry, to left, encounter Italian Gendarmes. Swiss Pike, at bottom, still approachingThe battle saw the French Gendarmes split up.  One unit went in to the Italian line, avoiding the pike, and attempted to engage the Swordsmen and the Crossbow.  They were partially successful against the Swordsmen (mauling them), but were eventually swarmed by the Italian Crossbow, and the Italian Pike.Mercenary Italian Crossbowman, in French ServiceAs mentioned in Part 1, I have a wide variety of renaissance figures, although I recently acquired a good many of the Late 15th/Early 16th century variety from a friend - thanks Mark.  Where I needed to, however, I filled in for this fight.  The Mercenary Italian Crossbow, for instance, are actually about 50-100 years out of period (they are early figures, I believe originally sold by Mikes Models as Early Swiss?).French Gendarmes encounter Italian SwordsmenOne thing about the Neil Thomas rules for this period - they were written in reaction to his own Medieval (and Ancient) rules.  Those rules featured all units (except artillery - which have only 1 stand) to be comprised of four stands - in a 2x2 formation.  That holds true of the renaissance rules with regards to cavalry, but infantry is typically a 6 stand unit.  To make the rules work without a lot of fuss about multi-unit combats, lanes of advance, flank definitions, etc - he kept the units to a simple 2 stand frontage, but now infantry is three ranks deep.  When the unit has to engage, it rolls combat dice for all stands, making the Renaissance infantry quite a bit tougher compared to the earlier infantry.Used as French Mounted Archers, without their bowsThe cavalry in these rules, hit pretty hard, against everyone except fellow cavalry of the same grade (i.e. Gendarmes v Gendarmes, or Stradiots v Stradiots), and against Pike (to be understood).  However, against everyone else they hit pretty hard.  For instance, Gendarmes roll 2d6 per stand vs. Swordsmen, and 3d6 vs Shot (either arquebus or crossbow).  But only 1d6 vs other Gendarmes, or vs Pikemen.Mercenary Crossbow preparing to cross the riverThe terrain tiles I recently acquired from Hal are very nice to put under a game.  Other than the persistent pattern of the surface of the foam rubber tile, the paint and grass coating are very nice, and the color is great.  The tiles are thick enough to provide a nice surface on top of the table, and they lock together well.  If there is a complaint I have it is that the pattern of the rubber DOES show through (not a big deal), and also that the seam where the jigsaw edges lock together is apparent.  But that isn't too big a deal for a nice, portable surface.In the picture above, you can see some of the terrain elements I used.  Of course, I used felt for the road, which is always serviceable.  I used my commercial river, which looked good on the tile surface.  I also used a painted bridge and villa, both in resin originally.  And woodland scenics trees, mounted on fender washers.  The hills are beadboard, with paint and grass applied.  I did not make the hills, but I do have a series in the works - they are awaiting final finishing, and I hope to feature them in a game later on this spring or summer. Mounted Crossbow in the Italian armyI am not sure of all the newly acquired figures, but many of the figures I had that I merged together for this battle were Table Top Games (TTG), Minifigs, and Mike's Models.  They all look great on the tabletop, but the Minifigs and TTG look really good together.  Mike's Models always look a bit squatty, although I love the look.  It is like merging together the squatty Essex figures together with the old series 1 Minifigs.  Yeah, they are both ~15mm, but they might be of a different species - even though they both look great separately.During the game, I only had painted one unit of mounted crossbow available, and the Italian army called for two.  The army also had a unit of foot crossbow, so I made the decision to dismount one of the mounted crossbow units, and field it (for the battle) as a foot unit.  I actually have (recently dug out, and based for priming) enough Minifigs mounted crossbow (in the 15mm Renaissance line) to complete a unit.  Pictures to follow, as they get completed. I use nylon upholstery rings for casualty markersThe ruleset from Mr Thomas has a variety of different figures per base, and used basing sizes to make it fully compliant with the typical WRG style basing (used in everything from WRG, DBA, Might of Arms, to more modern things, not to mention Armati, Impetus, etc etc etc).  So that means that a stand will have anywhere between 2 figures (for light infantry, and light cavalry) to 3 or 4 figures (for denser, heavier formations of troops).  An artillery piece has a gun and the crew.  In the rules, each stand (regardless of type) takes four hits.  So your 2 figure light infantry stand takes four hits, and my 3 figure arquebus, and my 4 figure halberdiers all take four hits.  I mark the casualties with plastic upholstery rings, and there is no paperwork.  Casualties carry over - if I have three hits on my unit, and I take two more hits (total of five), that is one removed stand, and one hit carried over.Stands come right off the unit.  The rules allow for mixed units (halberd/bow, and pike/shot, for instance).  The rules are, when a unit loses a stand in melee combat it is always either a pike or halberd stand.  When it loses a stand from fire combat, it is always either a bow or shot stand.  When you lose a stand to shooting, that is all. But when you lose a stand to Melee combat, then you have to pass a morale test (the only morale tests in the game) - for instance, Levy troops require a 5 or 6 on a D6 roll.  No such rolls are required for losing a stand to Fire combat.French Gendarmes ride past an Italian VillaOne thing I don't have, that I would like to, for further Italian Wars wargaming, or campaigning, and that is additional suitable Italian wargames terrain.  Most of what I have works just fine, but I feel like to get that Italian countryside feel, I need some stone/brick buildings with roundtile roofs (like the white building above, but that might be more Mediterranean or Iberian (or Mexican).  I have a few more like that, and they'll do, but more is better.  Oh, and poplar trees.  All the paintings I have ever seen of the Italian countryside, always feature Poplar trees - either manicured groups of them in farm country, or growing along roads, around farm buildings, etc.The Italian Condottieri leading the GendarmesOne of the things I really like about this time period, is the preponderance of really, heavy hitting cavalry.  There were certainly a LOT of different types of light cavalry during the period (mounted crossbows proliferate through the Italian Wars, as well as Stradiot, Genitors, and others).  The introduction of gunpowder is the peeling of the death knell of the bells of history, as far as formed cavalry is concerned, but it will take military science four more centuries to lose its love affair with the deadly effective massive cavalry charge.Charles VIII Enter For the purposes of developing scenarios, the fact that the Imperialists, the French, and to a certain extent the Spanish all viewed the wealthy Italian cities as plump ripe prizes for the taking, it is a great time and a great place to set wargames.  There have been many folks who observed and commented, over the years, that pike and shot wargaming is rather rare, considering it is a colorful period, and has a unique (identifiable) combat style with strong, distinctive combat arms in each army.  One of the reasons I think it is rare is this - many people view Renaissance warfare (tactically) as one of Rock-Paper-Scissors (I even had a dealer at a convention remark that to me, many many years ago, as I was buying some figures from him).  If you have Pike, they automatically defeat Shot and Horse.  If you have Horse, they beat lesser Horse, and Shot.  If you have Shot, they can defend your Pike from flank attacks. Etc etc etc.  But I think it is more subtle of a period than that.The Situation in ItalyThe game was immensely satisfying, and I have been looking for a historical situation to base a solo campaign on.  Ideally it would be based on a situation where there were multiple independent political units, with armies of roughly the same technology,  in a confined geographic space.  Italy at the end of the 15th century is almost perfect.  Time to consult with my Machiavelli map.Great images of soldiery from the time, in this set of German prints showing city flags and heraldry."},
{"title": "Italian Wars miniature wargame", "date": "Monday, March 21, 2016", "text": "(Note: Part 2 of this article is posted here).Recently I have been organizing and working with my 15mm Renaissance collection.  I had a decent sized collection - split about evenly between early 16th century figures for an Italian War type army (pike, arquebus, bombard, swordsmen, gendarmes), and a mid 17th century conflict (later Thirty Years War, or English Civil War - with soldiers in buff coats and breastplate, or unarmored, with pikes, early muskets, reiters with plate mail and pistol, and buffcoat cavalry with sword and pistol).  I have played games, and even written rules and campaigns, for both periods in the past (in the years before Gaming with Chuck existed, mostly).  A fantastic time period, full of all sorts of military pageantry and great history. Gaming With Chuck published an earlier article on Renaissance Wargaming, with links to great reference material.In addition to the collection I already owned, I recently came into a large collection of 16th century types that really buff out my collection.  Hundreds of infantry (mostly pikemen, but also some with polearms and swords, as well as a generous amount of arquebus/musket troops).  Also many, many cavalrymen - mostly of the gendarme variety but also a solid number of reiters.  This really fills out my collection nicely, in the late 15th and early 16th century.So I thought it prudent to set up and play a game, since I have spent so much time lately oohing and aahing over the figures.  Especially the new figures, but also how many different armies I can form, from the period, given the troops that I now own.I set up a 4x6 table, with a river, a crossroads, and a small villa/farm - with a few gentle hills and some scattered, but small (probably sheared back) forest areas.  It  could be Northern Italy.  I find myself wishing for more poplars, and more houses with an Italian architecture (possible modeling projects for the future).  See Part 2 of this article, for pictures of the wargaming table, and the game in action.This is the look I was going for - must get more poplars... Then I set out two armies.  At first I was considering the Terry Gore rules for Renaissance, and then I opted for the smaller, but very fun to play, Neil Thomas rules for Renaissance in his Wargaming: An Introduction (discussed and reviewed many times here at GwC).  What I did not have with me was a phone or camera, but I will be playing out the game over the next week or so, and I will post pictures of the game in progress.The French army has the following units:2x Units of Swiss Pike1x Unit of Crossbow2x Units of Gendarmes1x Unit of Mounted Bow2x CannonThe third mounted unit (the Mounted Bow) is interesting.  It is named mounted bow, but by the late 15th/early 16th century they did not use their bows from horseback.  Instead they are lighter, less elite version of the knights (the gendarmes) - nobility mounted on armored horses, and carrying a military grade lance.The Italian (Condottieri) army has the following units:2x units of Gendarms1x unit of Mounted Crossbow (should be two units, but I converted one to a foot unit)2x units of Foot Crossbow1x unit of Italian Pike1x unit of Swordsmen1x Medieval Bombard (primitive compared to the cannon)The pikemen and swordsmen will not be a match for the Swiss in French service.  The Gendarmes are of a higher grade than the French Gendarmes, so that might be the key to winning.THE Condottiero - from Da Vinci"},
{"title": "Casual Game Day - March 12", "date": "Monday, March 14, 2016", "text": "We had some good friends visit this weekend, and decided to have a board game day.  Mostly we played casual games, and had some good conversations.Started out with \"the cow game\" - that is, our nickname for the German card game 6 Nimmt!  If this game has a theme (and it really doesn't) it is the great cartoony art of the cow's heads on the cards.  It is the one time when at our house, multiple people will be talking about hornochsen and trying not to curse their bad luck!This was followed up by another lightweight, the dice game that we always reach for as filler, whether with gamers or non gamers alike.  Zombie Dice!  This brilliant, but again simple, little dice game from Steve Jackson Games is much more fun than it should be.  And it always allows us to compare various levels of luckiness, and decry the ever-present factor of \"kid dice\" - that strange luck that accrues to the youngest gamer at the table in a dice game.If there is a game that is less in need of expansion, or of dressing up with accessories, it is Zombie Dice.  And yet . . . we have both expansions (ZD:2 and ZD:3), but never play with them (well, we did when they first came out, but gentle readers - they are not favorites here at Gaming with Chuck HQ).  And the game does not need to be dressed up.  But I have been thinking of getting some brains for scoring.  Typically we will use a score pad, but the plastic Bag O'Brains option is pretty nice, as are some of the rubber brain pencil erasers.  Perhaps.We followed up Zombie Dice with The Resistance.  A good game, pairing logic and deduction, with suspicion and hidden roles.  Fun, and of course, the Spy players were quite secretive and kept their cool until the end, when they finally persevered.  One of the few times I've seen the Spy players win, without taking the first round.  But we had a lot of new players on both sides.Okay, so with a house full of experienced gamers (and two new comers), and a game collection with hundreds and hundreds of titles in it, why did we pick these three?  Simple - we had 7 players, and wanted to do something lightweight.  They were perfect for the mood and the number of players.  Sure, we like 7 Wonders, and have been wanting to try Between Two Cities, with a full table - but that wasn't the mood.  There was brief mention of Caverna, and also Formula D, but we decided to stick with the light stuff.After The Resistance, we lost two players, and then with five there was a request for Ticket to Ride.  So we got out our 10th anniversary board, set it up, and proceeded to teach two new players how to play.  They left the game convinced that they had to get TtR and also check out some of these other games that we play.  Success.We broke for dinner, and after dinner, a different subset of the group played Apples to Apples.  A much better, and much less offensive version of the game than that other one (which I won't name, but which actively engages players to lose their humanity).  They had a ton of fun (I did not partake in AtA). Were there other games we wanted to play?  Yes, definitely.  Some of the people who visited have been part of various D&D games we have played over the past few years (and one of them, I have played RPGs with since the late 1980s).  But not this time.  We have planned to play next time we get together.The other thing we talked about playing was a miniatures game.  Several of us have been quite taken in by Frostgrave (from Osprey Games).  A very fun game.  But again, while we compared our recently painted figures (wizards and hirelings) we did not play this time.  Clearly another game day is needed, real soon."},
{"title": "AWI game using Black Powder", "date": "Wednesday, December 2, 2015", "text": "Last weekend (Thanksgiving weekend, which if I can be sincere for a moment, is a very important holiday for me, because I am Thankful to the Almighty for everything in my life...but I come close to being serious) I was lucky enough to get to host a 15mm AWI game at my house (on the GwC grand command center wargaming table - located in the basement).  I had a few great friends come over (which made it a perfect Thanksgiving weekend activity, see my earlier serious comment).We played Black Powder, using the 50% reduction suggestion for 15mm (basically, the game is identical, as it should be, but all distances are halved).The game featured 3 commands on each side (for the planned 6 players), and each command controlled two brigades.The scenario was a fictional fight based in late September, 1780, in South Carolina, and is based on the premise that the Americans won the Battle of Camden.The thesis is this:  First, the Southern Towns of the Cherokee Nation did not join the British against the Colonials, but remained neutral (so rather than being attacked by the SC Militia, they were harassed by the Carolina Loyalists).Cherokee vs Soldiers: Imagine they had been British?Second, imagine the war in the South if the Battle of Camden (fought on my birthday, but 185 years early, on August 16, 1780) had been an American victory.  If the Militia and States troops (Virginia and NC) had followed the example set by the Maryland and Delaware troops, and they all stood and fought, then the American force would have retained it's numerical superiority, and with 1,500 Continentals vs. 1,500 British regulars it very well could have gone the way of General Gates, rather than towards Cornwallis.Battle of Camden: Imagine if the Colonials hadn't run?Now, with the Cherokee's in the area being neutral, and leaning away from the British, and the Continentals having just won a large victory, the premise was that the Cherokee's would send two warbands to join the Continental army, along with a locally raised militia (both infantry and mounted) under a Colonel Von Ottendorf, based on Armand, who had been sitting out the conflict so far.Colonel Von Ottendorf, from his home in Asheville NCThe British, in response to the defeat, would have had Cornwallis taking the south much more seriously, and calling down reinforcements.  But, with the situation in the north what it was in late 1780, that would mean shifting Hessians, which is what we reflected in the game.Hessians - tired of New Jersey winter raids,  The army under Gates started to swing south, planning to reinforce Columbia, but after reports of Cornwallis being in pursuit, and having met up with the Hessians brought in from Charleston, the Continentals instead veered to the southeast, along the Congaree river.  In the area that is now the Congaree National Park, about 15 miles southeast of Columbia, is where I envisioned the battle to take place.Continental troops defend the tributary bridgeSo the Colonial forces had two brigades of Continentals (same as at Camden), two brigades of various states regiments and Militia (mostly NC and Virginia), and also a brigade under Von Ottendorf, and a mixed brigade of SC Mounted Militia and Cherokee Indians.Banastre TarletonThe King's Army had one brigade of British Regulars, one brigade of Tarleton's British Legion and cavalry, two brigades of Carolina Loyalist infantry (Tories), one brigade of mixed Hessians and Philadelphia Tories (shifted down with the mercenaries), and one brigade of pure Hessians.The Congaree river was on Gates' right, and the battle was fought on the southern side of the river.  On his right were the two Continental brigades (\"B\"). In the middle (\"A\") were the Virginia and NC regiments, and on the left (\"C\") were Ottendorf and the Cherokee.  The middle of the field was pretty clear, except for a manor house, with some planted plots of vegetables, and a peach grove.  The far southern end (where the Cherokee and militia were located) was forested, and the northermost end of the field (where the Continentals were located) had a tributary to the Congaree running through it, with a stone bridge across the stream, and a town.Battlefield, showing tributary stream (upper right) and road networkCornwallis left was also anchored at the River, and that was where his Regulars (\"D\") were placed.  In the middle were the British Legion (Tarleton) and the Tories (\"E\").  On the right end of the field (facing the Cherokee and Von Ottendorf, mostly to the left of \"C\") were the Hessians (at \"G\").The game was pretty good, even though out of the six players, only one had played Black Powder many times.  I had one previous game under my belt, but not enough to count as experienced.  The other four players had never played before.States regiments and the Militia - Hold the Line!It is a testament to the rules that it went so well.  Each player had two brigades, and after the second turn the concept of initiative moves, and command moves, and issuing verbal orders before rolling for command was almost second nature.  The rules for shooting and combat are straight forward enough, and we got to concentrate on the scenario (which was great).  The rules were great, the scenario was fun.  Lots of misquoted lines from \"The Patriot\" including (several times) \"Hold the Line\". Thank you Benjamin Martin.British Legion Cavalry - led by Lucius MalfoyI definitely sense more Black Powder in the future!"},
{"title": "Play test 1 of From the Sky We Came", "date": "Wednesday, November 18, 2015", "text": "Notes from my first play test of the Samurai era wargame rules I recently posted.. I didn't have my camera with me, so no photos yet.After organizing my Feudal Japanese figures last night, I set out a few to represent some Clans of two different armies, and I went through the clan activation part of the game.  Some observations-First, having markers on Clan Leaders showing their Command value is a huge time saver. Same with Bushi.Second, if a unit is less than half strength and loses a morale test, it should disperse - otherwise small units might be littering the table forever.Third, ninjas. I have some ninjas in my collection, and I need to include ninjas.  Just a few, like garlic on pizza, should go a long way.Melee combat - I'm not sure I am crazy about having melee resolved after one dice toss.  I might change to a system with pushback and Bushi tests.Not sure about the need for formations. I included rules for a column (to move through a village, mountain pass, or bamboo forest) but otherwise, just in a battle formation.Basing.  I am torn between a square base method and a regular linear WRG type method, but I plan to rebase the collection.Here is a scene from a TV drama showing a dramatization of the cavalry charge during the battle of Nagashino (1575), against the first recorded use of volley fire in Japan.  Interesting, but great images of armor and horse equipment.http://youtu.be/bIs3ibPgosEAnd, for further research, the movies of Kurosawa are always welcome. This is a clip from Ran, showing a unit of Ashigaru firing from under cover and disrupting a cavalry charge. Great imagery of Sashimono, but the representation of units is very fluid compared to how wargamers typically represent bodies of troops.  Kurosawa might not be strictly historical, but it is very inspirational imagery.https://youtu.be/m4Sc32qDzXU"},
{"title": "From the Sky we Came - Samurai Period Miniature Rules", "date": "Tuesday, November 17, 2015", "text": "I wanted to come up with a set of miniature rules for playing out 15mm battles between armies representing the Samurai Clans struggling for position with each other during the period of the 16th century (the Sengoku period, which is typically from the mid 15th century, through the end of the 16th), roughly ending with the battle of Sekigahara (Oct 21, 1600).  Detail from the Battle of Sekigahara The name of the rules (\"From the Sky we Came\") comes from a line in a death poem written by Hôjô Ujimasa.  Ujimasa died (was forced to commit suicide, along with his brother) in 1590, after losing Odowara castle to Toyetomi Hideyoshi.  Ujimasa had been the head of the Hôjô clan, so upon losing his clan's castle to his clan's enemy, he was forced to commit sepuku.  Before doing so, he wrote the following death poem:Autumn wind of eve,blow away the clouds that massover the moon's pure lightand the mists that cloud our mind,do thou sweep away as well.Now we disappear,well, what must we think of it?From the sky we came.Now we may go back again.That's at least one point of view.- Hôjô UjimasaOdawara CastleBelow are the rules.  Keep in mind these are a playtest level prototype, and there might be some interesting combinations resulting from using these.  They do seem to be pretty playable.  Pictures of the playtest are coming.From the Sky we Came Units and organizationUnits are roughly of two types, Cavalry (3-4 stands per unit) and Infantry (6-8 stands per unit).  On the table top, Cavalry is always represented either in column (one stand wide, for movement purposes), or in a single line (one stand deep, 3 or 4 stands in width).  Infantry is also either in column (one stand wide), or in line (two stands deep, either 3 or 4 stands in width).Units are organized by clan (roughly), with a Clan leader being in charge of from 3 to 8 units per clan.  Each clan will have a Clan Leader, as a separate piece, distinct from the units.  Each side,  will have an overall commander, or Army General.Unit TypesUnits are split between mounted and infantry.  Mounted units may be either:Mounted Warrior MonksMounted Samurai Infantry may be either:Warrior MonksSamuraiAshigaruPeasantsCavalry are considered to be armed with a mixture of pole arms (spear, lance), and swords.Infantry must be marked as being armed with hand weapons (katana, nodachi), pole arms (yari, naginata, etc), arquebus, or bow.Samurai infantry units may have two categories of weapons - such as hand weapons (swords) and bow.Command and BushiEach command stand (either Clan leader or General) has a Command rating.  This is a rating of that leader's ability to command troops in battle.  It will be an 8 for a Clan Leader, and a 9 for the General, but could be modified by a scenario or based on a historical battle.Command is used by the command stand to (1) activate moves, (2) rally routing troops, (3) reform disordered troops.Each unit has a Bushi rating.  This is a measure of the unit's general martial spirit and willingness to fight.  In the game, it is used for a test to see if the unit will (1) close to contact in a charge, (2) stand up to a charge from the enemy, and (3) charge lesser units if ordered to do so.  The first two tests (charge, and stand) are made against a unit's Bushi rating whenever a charge is ordered.The third test must be made by a Samurai unit that is ordered either to stand, or to charge another unit, when an enemy Samurai unit is within charge distance.  If the this test is made against bushi when the Samurai unit is activated to move, and the unit Passes the test, rather than do what is ordered, it will instead move (at charge speed) towards an enemy Samurai unit within charge distance.Unit Bushi RatingSamurai - 9Warrior Monks - 8Ashigaru - 7Peasants - 6Optional - When a unit is required to take its first Bushi Test, roll 1d6.  If the result is a 1, then the unit has its Bushi modified down by one point, and if it is a 6, then it is modified up by one point.  Keep track of this, as the unit will have to make tests against this Bushi value throughout the battle.Turn SequenceAt the beginning of a turn, the two Generals will each roll 2d6 plus the number of Clans they still have under their control.  The high roller will then activate his first clan.Activating a clan is done by rolling against the Command target of the Clan Leader for that clan.  If successful (by rolling equal to, or less than the Command number of that Clan Leader), then the player rolls two d6, and chooses the highest of the two dice.  That is the number of actions he has for the units in his clan.If a player misses the roll against his Clan Leader's Command number, then that Clan may not activate this round.  It is now his opponent's opportunity to nominate a Clan Leader to roll for.  This alternates back and forth, as long as both sides still have Clans to activate.  Once only one side has Clans left to activate, he may (one at a time) seek to roll for them, but the Command number for those Clan Leaders is treated as one lower than normal (representing that it is harder to coordinate a larger army)."},

{"title": "19th Century Imagi-nations - Terrain for the 23 Weeks War pt 1", "date": "Wednesday, October 28, 2015", "text": "In 1871, when the 23 weeks war began, the forces of Furstenberg invaded the Cantons of Rumpwhistle, and began operations around Lake Nyakker.  The first land engagement was between the three Companies (in name only, they are close to battalion strength, of about 600 men each) of the Furstenberg Seebataillone fighting Fribourg canton militia at the battle of Krump's Farm.The border between Furstenberg and Rumpwhistle runs through the Karzstan MtsOne of the recent model farm houses that I built was based on the farm house of this engagement.  The other key terrain features of the battle are (1) the old oak forest, and (2) the Persimmon grove at Krump's Farm.The farm house is as constructed, recently.  It will be based on a base with a wall around the farm yard, and a work building in the back yard.  The base I am working on (I will post photos) will have a rough, but ruined, outline of the house, that the actual model house sits on.  This allows for the possibility of Krump's farm house to be destroyed by artillery or fire during the battle.The Persimmon grove will be modeled by using several rows of smaller 15mm trees, representing the grove, with the stone wall around it.  This allows for the fight in and around the grove, and should be pretty flexible.The edge of the old Oak forest, that also saw action, will be modeled using larger 28mm trees, grouped together on dark felt to show the forest outline.Pictures will be posted soon, but here is a map of the battlefield... The map is approximately 6' wide by 4' from north to south.  The features, labeled, are these:A. Krump's Farm, with a stone wall around it.B. The Persimmon Grove, also with a wall around it.C. The Chewgas Stream, that runs south east to the Maduro River, and south west to Lake Nyakker.  It is deep and fast, not fordable, but not very wide (about 2\" in game scale).D. Hedge rows, tall enough for a man to hide behind (soft cover - concealing, but not protective)E. Two other farms along the road into the Maduro ValleyThe Furstenberg Light Brigade (consisting of three battalion strength units of Seebataillone, and a battery of light guns from the Eiderduck) had landed by ships boats on the north shore of Lake Nyakker, and enter this map from the south side, between the southwestern leg of the Chewgas, and the southwest corner of the table.The Fribourg Canton militia are in place, with one battalion stationed east of the bridge, on the road between the two farms, and two battalions in the ground between Krump's Farm and the Chewgas stream.  Finally, two units of Rumpwhistle sharpshooters will enter the road, in the northwest corner of the board.The battle is simple - the Furstenberg troops must cross the Chewgas, and the Rumpwhistle militia must do their best to stop them."},
{"title": "25mm houses project - pictures and tutorial", "date": "Sunday, October 25, 2015", "text": "Working on some 25mm houses, to rebuild some of my terrain collection that has frittered away and declined over the past decade or so.I want to build a couple of different styles of houses, mostly useful for late medieval through 19th century.  These will be used for a variety of different European conflicts (and, as always, will be stolen for everything else that I can think of), but initially they are intended for Balkanian wars in the mid 19th century.  The regions of Balkania that I tend to wargame that period in  (my two imagi-nations of Furstenburg and Rumpwhistle) are relatively poor, although they enjoyed some prosperity in the 15th and 16th century.  So most of the durable buildings left in the area (everything from wealthier farm houses, to high street shops, castles, churches, and taverns) are based on older (pre-19th century) architecture.  So this works perfectly with my bigger goal of rebuilding some houses that will be useful for a variety of conflicts.My first goal are a couple of houses that could be used, maybe along with a tavern or a church, as the focal point for a small village.  So this first round are basically stand alone farm houses, that might end up in a walled compound with a small work building, animal housing, or a barn.For construction, I looked at several options, including a lot of the really lovely print-and-assemble buildings that are available.  In the end, I returned to my favorite - which is using foam core board for the basic structure, and then applying architectural and details on top of that.So first step was to cut out some basic shapes.  I chose to make the one story structures basically 1.5 inches tall, and then have a peaked roof rise another inch above that.  I made the peak ends of the house 3 inches wide, and the side structures another three inches.  For this basic pattern, I cut out enough pieces for two structures.Foam core board is easy to work with, if you have a relatively sharp cutting implement, and resign yourself to having to cut along a score line a few times.  If you are unfamiliar with the material, it has been around for some time, and has been used for gaming models for a few decades now, and originally was used for really nice Architectural models.  It is basically two layers of paper (or sometimes sheet plastic) filled with a layer of foam, to give it thickness and strength.  My method, is always to cut three times (which almost always results in a nice clean edge).  First cut is to go through the top layer of paper.  Next cut is to go through the foam, and score the bottom piece of paper.  The third cut goes through the bottom piece of paper.  If you try this with anything but a sharp razor knife (an X-acto or something similar), then you will end up mangling the foam, and pulling/tearing the paper.  If you haven't worked with foam core board before, this is the single best tip I can share.Next is to assemble the basic pieces.  There are a couple of options here, for strength and proper angles.  First, is to use straight pins, through one piece of foam core, into the one being glued to it - this holds it in place, provides extra strength, and ensures a straight join.  For these small structures, I didn't feel as if it was necessary, but when I have built much larger structures (castle walls, towers, large middle eastern buildings, Indian temples, etc) I almost always use straight pins.The second option, is to use some sort of straight edge angle piece inside as a support to give the building strength and to help keep the corners square.  Again, on these small structures I didn't go this route, for two reasons.  First is because I could square them on my cutting surface grid, and basically just hold them until the tacky glue dries (I use tacky white glue for these, because it dries quick, is cheap, and is extremely easy to work with).  Second, is because I plan to mount these to wooden bases, will will ensure lots of strength down the road.Once these guys set, and are dried, if you have any overhang on any edge, and you think it might be too much to cover over with the decorative material (whatever you end up using - paper, paint, spackle filler, etc), then you can use a razor knife to trim the left over bits that overhang.Leave those basic structures to dry for a while before proceeding to the decorate stage.  Once I did that, however, I decided that rather than paint these guys (which would have involved some sort of undercoat of white spackle filler, or white primer paint) I would use colored paper for the basic wall covers.  I used a nice 65 lb weight card stock, mostly because it won't warp when you glue it, or if you come back and paint details on it.  I cut out basic shapes to glue on, and using a glue stick I attached them.  One thing - it is nice, at this stage, when you are covering over the side pieces to make sure the edges of the foam board on the end pieces are covered over.  Another technique to do this, which I usually use in conjunction to employing straight pins, is to cut away a section of one layer of paper and the foam on the end piece, and then the side piece fits in, so that once they are glued together and dried, there is no foam edge showing.  I will try to do a model like that soon, and post pictures.As you can see, with this method, I was a little bit sloppy with my edges - so that the colored paper does not line up exactly with each other.  That's okay, because I plan to do some details that will decorate the edges, as well as cover up that gappy join.  For these houses, I planned to do a variety of different constructions.  One method will be half timber, and the other member will be stone structure with plastered over walls.  This first house is of the second variety, so I have to give the idea of stacked stones for support at the corners.  This gives me a great excuse to cover over that gap.I cut out some different colored card stock - grey to suggest stonework - and decorated with a fine point marker the basic outlines of the stones.  Then using precision scissors I cut these pieces out, and scored them on one side (to help with a crisp fold).  A tip - whenever you have surfaces like this that are supposed to stand out on any sort of paper construction, always outline your pieces with black. Try not to let any edges of paper show that are not some dark color.  That is like black lining when you paint - it suggests depth, and shadows, in small ways, and hides some of the obvious model making materials.  These houses are far from realistic, but the black edging makes them look a little better (even if they are supposed to be the old school sort of cartoony terrain seen in a lot of the older wargaming books and magazines).  This is what I tried to do with this corner stone work (and also with the roof piece).kAs you can see, the edges cover over the joins between the sides and ends, and the stone work looks reasonable.The last basic piece, before decorating with architectural details, is the roof.  For a small building like this, I used a basic piece of card stock, cut and scored, and with end flaps folded down to suggest depth, and just glued it on.  There you have the basic, finished shape of the model house.For this building, some of the features I would want to add are (at least) a door and some windows.  Rather than messing around with glazed windows, I instead chose to do wooden shutters.The door is done in layerd pieces of card stock - a dark wood for the background of the door, and a lighter wood for the door itself.  I did a small grey threshold stone under the door, again as a piece of decorated (slightly) card stock.The effect of the door that I was trying was for something like this . . . Rather than adding on separate black pieces for the hinges and door handle, etc, I just decorated the door with a fine point marker.For future cottages, and efforts, I had considered doing other details, like a lintel window over the door, or even a window as part of the door, but I think those are details that speak to a later architecture than what I was aiming for.  Here are some examples of other doors that feature those other elements - maybe to be added later . . .The presence of gourds almost certainly mark this as a Balkanian door...While a later period door (note the electric light), this could be nice to model.At this point, the details on the roof decoration are seen.  I added some simple lines to suggest tiles on the roof.  I could have gone with thatch, or some other material (chinked planks, shakes, etc) - but instead, I wanted to suggest tiles. So, there is the first house.  I also built two others, with different looks and architectural features, to model specific buildings in Balkania, but the next article will talk about them."},

{"title": "Why do I plan game activities?", "date": "Sunday, September 27, 2015", "text": "To me, it is important to plan gaming activities.  This is because of a couple of different reasons, personally, so if I can ramble on for a few minutes, here are a few of them.1. It gives me goals.  If I know I a want to do a game in the future (solo, for/with friends, at a convention) then planning will give me a timeline to get done what I need to (learn rules, paint miniatures, playtest, write up a dungeon, etc).  Of course, procrastination is always a stumbling stone, but with a plan, at least you can know what you SHOULD have done, on the way down, once you stumble. 2. Mental exercise.  Sometimes, my schedule is just too darned full to get in some of the gaming activities I want to do.  For instance, in my current look at 15mm AWI gaming, one thing I would like to do is rebase some miniatures.  Also build some terrain.  But I might not have good chunks of time in my schedule over the next few weeks to do those things - but what I can do is research battles, re-read rules, and maybe get orders of battle and scenarios down on paper.  Why those things?  Because they are all easily doable at the computer, or with a tablet, or with a book and pencil - while doing other things.  Lunch, watching a movie with the family, waiting for response on a work email.  etc.  They are planning activities - not the same as actual gaming activities - but they scratch an itch and keep my mind engaged in the topic.3. Evaluate what needs to be done for a future event.  If I plan to do a Third Crusade wargame in November (which I am thinking of), then I will start thinking about my miniatures, rules, wargames terrain, scenario - etc.   While planning, I will take stock of what I already have available, and what needs to be developed.4. Sometimes if I don't plan things, then (since I am interested in so many different gaming topics, and a victim of my own ability to change focus at the drop of the hat) sometimes I don't get anything done, and another year has passed and I still haven't played out the whole Furstenburg/Rumpwhistle 23 Weeks War of 1870. What is worse, is that I haven't recorded it here for posterity on the blog (what would the world do if it did not know the outcome of the 23 Weeks War?).5. Related to all the above - it is fun.  Planning is a gaming exercise - whether it is the next set of encounters for my RPG campaign, or sorting miniatures and planning a painting project - it is all fun.  And I like to talk about it and share it here on the blog.One thing I am interested in doing more of, in the coming months, and that I have already begun actively preparing for, is some 15mm wargaming in the American War of Independence.  I recently came into the possession of a large collection (and very complete) of 15mm armies, representing Americans (of various shapes and hues - colonists, loyalists, state militia, minutemen, continental army, etc), French, Hessians (and other German mercenaries), Indians, and many, many British.  Oh, and an odd Tory to kick around.I have set up a wargaming table and have already started parsing out terrain for my first battle.  I am relying, initially, on a great overview of the battles of the American Revolution that exists in the single volume history of the military affairs of the AWI, called Patriot Battles, by Michael Stephenson (Harper/Perennial 2007). I have a couple of other nice historical volumes to consult on the topic, but I find Patriot Battles to be a good starting point, when researching a battle.  A matter of taste, I suppose.The battle I am planning to start with is going to be Germantown.  A few reasons are in order, I suppose.  First, I like the whole of the Philadelphia 1777 campaign.  But I have never been a fan of the battle of the Brandywine.  No hobbits, I suppose.  Second, I think that Germantown exhibits Washington's genius for a tactical solution, but it also shows his weakness, early on, in estimating the abilities of his generals and men.  His battle plan for Germantown is brilliant (almost Napoleonic), but it is a little bit optimistic (and the results showed it).  Third - the Chew House (which would be a great name for a Dog Treat company).Vicious fighting at the Chew House.The unfolding of events allows for all sorts of military scenario event listing (MSEL) items to occur.  The arrival (or not) of American reinforcements on the British Flank).  The ability of the Americans to actually engage and carry against a smaller Hessian force.  The firing on friendly troups.  And the Chew House.  I suspect that there is a possibility (while we are rewriting history) for British troops to arrive by flat boat, from down river, assuming that they completed their work against the American forts (not part of the battle, but it did leach off some of the British troops in the area).Great map, from 1877, but it doesn't show the initial American disposition.The battle features 11,000 troops under General Washington's command, and some 9,000 troops under the command of General Howe.  According to the (useful) website British Battles the units involved were:British ManifestLight Dragoons (not clear which regiment 16th or 17th)Two Composite battalions of grenadiersTwo Composite battalions of light infantryTwo Composite battalions of Foot Guards (1st, 2nd and 3rd Guards)5th Foot later Northumberland Fusiliers and now the Royal Regiment ofFusiliers25th, now King’s Own Scottish Borderers27th Foot later the Inniskilling Fusiliers and now the Royal IrishRegiment40th Foot later the South Lancashire Regiment and now the Queen’sLancashire Regiment55th Foot later the Border Regiment and now the King’s Own RoyalBorder Regiment(and Hessians)American ManifestWayne’s Pennsylvania BrigadeWeeden’s Virginia BrigadeMuhlenburg’s Virginia BrigadeMaxwell’s Light InfantryColonel Bland’s 1st DragoonsStephen’s DivisionStirling’s DivisionPennsylvania MilitiaMaryland MilitiaNew Jersey MilitiaThe Pennsylvania units were (supposedly) armed with rifled muskets, but I don't know how much of an impact that had on the battle.  Still, it adds flavor and interest for a wargame.I will consult the scenario book for British Grenadier (miniature rules) to check for a more detailed manifest, but that is my starting point.  It is possile that the West Point military atlas also has more detailed OB information.Attack against the British 40th Infantry, inside the Chew HouseFor the tabletop map, I plan to have the table stretch from the American right, past the Manatawny road (southwest of Germantown) where Armstrong was supposed to push past the Hessans at the Schuykill River side.  The other end of the table will be the American left, past the Old York (northeast of Germantown) where Smallwood and Greene were supposed to attack the British right flank.Map of the battle from the US Military AcademyThe American side of the battlefield will include Mount Airy (where Washington's HQ was), down to where the Frankford Creek crosses the Old York Road (including Howe's HQ).At about the middle of the table, slightly closer to the American side, will be the Chew House.British Troops entering the Chew House (the architecture is wrong in this picture)I intend to fight some other battles of the AWI, now that I have this great collection of miniatures, but this will be the first.As far as rules  - I have not decided.  I have considered several old school sets of rules, and have only soundly rejected one completely (Valley Forge).  I have also considered Piquet, British Grenadier and the Neil Thomas rules.  And, of course, Sons of Liberty. In the end I will most likely write my own rules for this period, but I am just not sure about this first battle.  Pictures of the table top, terrain, and the units will of course follow.The quote used for the name of this blog post, \"These are the times that try men's souls\" was the opening line from Thomas Paine's first issue of his series of articles published in Philadelphia during the war, called simply The American Crisis.  This first issue was proclaimed on December 23, 1776, in Philadelphia.  The battle of Germantown would be fought, just outside of Philadelphia a mere 10 months later (on October 4, 1777).  The opening paragraph of that first article is worth reprinting here, and will no doubt stir your own soul (ignore all that financial motive related to taxes...).THESE are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated. Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right (not only to TAX) but \"to BIND us in ALL CASES WHATSOEVER\" and if being bound in that manner, is not slavery, then is there not such a thing as slavery upon earth. Even the expression is impious; for so unlimited a power can belong only to God."},

{"title": "Wargaming Scenario - Breakout 1915", "date": "Thursday, August 13, 2015", "text": "For the upcoming Guns of August convention, I am going to be running two miniature wargames events.  The first one will be a 15mm battle representing a Russian infantry division attempting to breakout from a German encirclement.  In order to make it interesting, I am only using a portion of the circle. The Russian units (four infantry regiments) are in good shape (rare for Russian units in WW1), and are pretty strong compared to their German counterparts.  They are being reinforced, as the battle opens up, by two mounted Cossack battalions.  The Russian infantry regiments have some attached MGs, but no artillery.The German regiments (four, again) are tired and have dampened morale.  What the Germans do have, is two field gun battalions mixed in with their infantry units, as well as MGs attached to the regiments.The objectives of the Russian division are to secure safe passage out of the area surrounding the town, and escape the encirclement, preferably by the north or east road.The German objectives are to either render the Russian division ineffective, or to contain it within the area.The time of the year is February, and while there is (surprisingly) not a lot of snow on the ground, a warm week has rendered the farm fields to the east of the town (between the cross roads and the forest line) to be soft and extremely muddy.I have written some home brew rules (modified from my Russian Civil War rules), that I call \"End of Empires\".  They are a basic \"I go/you go\" type rule system, rolling dice per stand to inflict casualties, and 2d6 vs a target number for morale.  The tactical decision in the game is when a unit takes casualties from fire, it can ignore a certain number per firefight, and choose to give up ground instead.  That is a costly decision for both sides, so I hope this is a good fight.  I have tried out the rules using blocks and dice at home, but you never know what Wargamers will try.  I will try to take lots of photos while refereeing, and post them here as a follow up article."},
{"title": "Recent Gaming News", "date": "Monday, June 29, 2015", "text": "I have been doing a lot of travel for work lately, so haven't been able to game too much.  Some things to report, however.First, Gaming with Chuck headquarters (GwCHQ) is due to relocate just after the middle of the month of July.  We will be decamping from Mossflower, our current location, to larger quarters at Bag End.  Early scouting reports have come back with this photo of the lane climbing up to the new quarters . . .Approximate map of Andrew Chapel Road, leading to Bag EndSecond, there has been a pair of acquisitions in the area of Miniatures for miniature wargaming.  The first of these is a collection of French and Indian War figures, in 15mm, from the Carl Scisio estate sale.  Carl was a member of ODMS, and had recently passed away.  There is a memorial page for him at the Guns of August 2015 website, and there is planned to be a large estate sell off of his (not small) miniatures collection at both Historicon 2015 and GoA 2015.  Prior to that, club members were able to make some donations to the family estate, through purchase of some miniatures.  I selected French & Indian War, which include a number of formed British and French units, and plenty of irregulars.  I plan to run some convention games over the next year, featuring the attack of, or defense of, Fort Carlhouse, and the Springdale settlements, in the forests between the Seneca and Shawnee in Pennsylvania.Fierce fighting at Fort CarlhouseThe second miniatures acquisition has been the acquisition of a large (over 1000 pieces) collection of Mexican War (1846-1848) miniatures, in 15mm.  Recent sorting and rules reviews have been taking place, but a decent sized Mexican-American War Table Top Exercise (TTX) - meaning a wargame with map based planning, campaign work, and finally tabletop battle execution - is planned for the first serious wargame to take place at the new Bag End location of GwCHQ. Mexican American War gaming should be pretty exciting!Third, several recent Boardgame purchases and acquisitions have taken place, more on that later, but recent board game plays have included some light fare such as Trekking the National Parks, and Dungeon Roll.  Just this evening, however, a game of Vikings took place at GwC, amidst the general chaos of bugging out the HQ and packing up the household.  Vikings is a great Michael Kiesling design, and plays well with 3 or 4 players.  We had a 3 player game, and I had the fun of introducing it to Anita and Heidi - everyone had a great time, in spite of it being a first for them.  I think I owe them a game of something more familiar (Catan or Carcassonne).Vikings! (bgg image)Fourth, some upcoming Science Fiction Roleplaying is imminent.  I have been preparing a Star Wars RPG (the WEG D6 version, using the second edition rulebook) session for an upcoming convention session, and simultaneously John D has been preparing a White Star RPG game, for online play (google Hangouts, most likely).  My Star Wars game will feature a band of adventurers on the YT-1300 light freighter \"Tumbling Asteroid\".  It is set between the battle of Yavin and the battle of Hoth, but the players are not necessarily part of the Rebellion (yet).  John's game will be set in the Solar System (as opposed to interstellar), and the players will be part of ASTRA - an organization dedicated to fighting pirates and smugglers.  Both sound great (as GM of Star Wars, and as player of White Star).Tumbling Mermaid is a YT-1300FP - combining passenger and freight optionsFifth, in the upcoming (#3) issue of Yaah! Magazine, I should have a couple of Star Wars articles (one for X-Wing, and one for Imperial Assault).  I recently got to play Star Wars X-Wing Miniatures, with Jack H's excellent Monday night group at World's Best Comics, in Newport News.  I had a truly excellent time!  The articles coming up in Yaah are (1) a mini campaign for the Rebels and Imperials to fight over control of a space station, fighting it out using X-Wing Miniatures.  The second article is a fight (inside) for control of the station, once one side or the other projects space control of the area around the space station.  That second battle (inside the station) is fought using Imperial Assault.  I'm pretty excited about the articles, and have started working on several others, and a boardgame design.  Who knows?"},

Admittedly, this followed a role playing session, which featured the intrepid adventurers in our World of Greyhawk campaign finally escaping the perils of Cannibal Island.  Of course, the means of escape (teleportation from the bowels of an evil castle on the rim of a fiery volcano) led them to a snowy pass in the Lortmil Mountains.  During a blizzard. With dire wolves and yetis closing in.  Oh, and Baba Yaga made an appearance (the first of many, in this campaign).  But they escaped from Cannibal Island. Back to the board games - half of the group retired after the RPG session, and dinner from a local pizza and subs shop, but the rest of us were in the mood for some light, fun board games.  Here is our play list:King of Tokyo (I didn't win)Boss Monster (I didn't win)Fandooble (I didn't win)Tsuro (I didn't win)Fandooble, again (I didn't win)Web of Power (I didn't win)There was a theme to those games.  But, of course, winning isn't so very important, especially here at GwC.   And besides, I got to run an RPG that featured octopus-men, yetis, a statue of Kali, and Baba Yaga, all in the same episode.  I really think I won, after all.As an aside, check out the web site run by the Esoteric order of Gamers, with a list of all the fantastic quick reference sheets they make.

{"title": "Naval Imagi-Nations Campaign", "date": "Tuesday, May 12, 2015", "text": "Background As the nations of Balkania left the Imperial Age, and entered into the age of massive industrialization, like their European counterparts, there was a mad rush to construct fleets of warships of ever increasing complexity and lethality, in an arms race that rivaled those of the early 20th century.Tweedland Destroyer FlagThe Imperial Navy of Tweedland, modeled after a number of successful designs in the British Navy form the years between the wars, was involved a series of strategic operations in the Pampion Sea, against her ancient adversary, Royal Marina of Vulgaria.  The Vulgarians had jump-started their naval architecture program just a few decades earlier by kidnapping several prominent Italian designers and engineers, so their units bear a strong resemblance to the Regia Marina.Vulgarian Royal MarinaTweedland, in this region, is operating from their colonial ports at Utica and Cyrene, and operate a rather large air station at Pancritas.  They are actively involved in policing the Pampion Sea, as well as supporting their ground operations in Talantis - which means delivering supplies to Tarraco.Vulgaria, on the other hand, has their southern mainland ports of Massilia and Salonae to support operations in the Pampion Sea.  The regional capitol at Cremona is home to not only Vulgarian 4th Air Force, but also is home to their notorious Motor Torpedo Boat squadrons.Friesland Naval EnsignThe ground campaign in Talantis is between the Tweedland 8th Army, and the Frieslander Talantian Corps.  In order to limit the amount of support that the Tweedland navy can deliver, the Frieslander Supreme Commander has authorized the use of U-Boats in the Pampion Sea, against Tweedland shipping.  These elements will occasionally coordinate with the Vulgarian Royal Marina.As a political gesture towards honoring the Pampion Triple Naval Alliance, the Free-Falconia Government has placed some of their remaining naval assets under command of the Tweedland colonial office at Utica.  These would normally be allocated to keeping the Talantian Approaches open, for supply convoys, but operational needs may have them committed, alongside Tweedland ships, throughout the Pampion theater of operations.Free Franconia Military ForcesCampaignI have been working up a simple system whereby two sides of players (one commanding British and French ships, representing Tweedland and Free-Falconia; the other commanding Italian and German forces, representing Vulgaria and Friesland) will follow this order of play for each turn:1. Allocate patrol forces - naval and air2. Receive operational intelligence and orders3. Commit reserve forces for support of operations, or divert patrol forces4. Adjudicate map situation, and develop tabletop battle for that turnRulesI will be using General Quarters.  I plan to employ the original GQ1 and 2 rules - I have the newer GQ3 edition of the rules (published by the fine folks at ODGW), and they are great, but they would distract, as I am expecting players who are not necessarily naval gaming experts, and the older rules are much simpler).  Ship models will be Navwar 1:3000 vessels.Operations MapThis was developed using AutoRealm, and I plan to use the same map for several different fictional naval campaigns.  I plan to go back and use the transition fleets I developed for Furstenberg and Rumpwhistle in an operation on this map, as well."},
{"title": "New Train Titles - pt 1", "date": "Monday, April 13, 2015", "text": "So, a few new games were acquired late last year.  Some of these were discussed in the posting about Thanksgiving gaming, and some were mentioned in the post about the Christmas break gaming.  But, a few of the titles were train related, and as train related gaming is something of a high interest theme here at Gaming with Chuck, it felt right to do a short blog post about it.First, a word about Train games.  These are not all what purists would call Railroad games.  To some, that includes the 18xx series.  To others, that includes the Martin Wallace masterpieces, Steam, Age of Steam, and the various derivative titles (Railroad Tycoon and Railways of the World).  Still others include railroad themed route building games (which tend to be lighter, such as Ticket to Ride, or TransAmerica).  To some it is the family of crayon based games, such as Empire Builder (and Dampfross, and many others).  It might include railroad theme games such as Russian Railroads.  And strange combinations of these, like Chicago Express.  Finally, to some it even includes games that have mechanics that are typically Railroad game mechanics, but for non-railroad themes like Elfenland, or Poseidon.To me, all of those are Train games.  It can be a train related mechanic (pick up and deliver, stock manipulation, network building, travel), or it can be theme (Russian Railroads, Express).So, what were some of the train titles acquired last year here at GwC headquarters?BoxcarsIsle of TrainsContinental Express Paris Connection Russian RailroadsTicket to Ride 10 Year Anniversary Set Trains: Rising SunYardmasterYardmaster ExpressA few words about these . . .Boxcars, of course, is the Rio Grande Games re-issue of the Avalon Hill classic, Rail Baron.  But wait!  Rail Baron was a reissue of the game Boxcars.  So we are now back to the original.  Except, it has a new board (the UK) and some adjusted rules.  This is a game of pick up and delivery.  The routes are all developed.  What players can do, other than receiving a constant stream of pickup and delivery points, is to purchase railroads, which are cheaper for them to run on, but more expensive for the competition. The game is a simple race to develop a pile of money ($200K) and then return to home base (starting position).  Very fun, and now made even better because the one tedious part of the game was using the charts to roll up cities for delivery.  This can be done, now, with a very nice App for iPad and iPhone - available for free from iTunes.  What a great thing!Isle of Trains is a great little card game, from the Dice Hate Me games series of 54 card games called the Rabbits.  This was the result of a kickstarter, the ended up with six published titles.  The series includes:Diner by designer Matthew O'MalleyBrew Crafters: The Travel Card Game by Ben RossetPie Factory by Byan FischerEasy Breezy Travel Agency by J. Alex KevernThe Fittest by Graham RussellIsle of Trains by Dan Keltner and Seth JaffeeYep - Seth Jaffee of Eminent Domain fame is the (co) designer of this great little card game.  The game is one of building your train (using mechanisms familiar to deck builder game players - cars have costs, and you pay that cost with other cards from your hand), and then loading cargo on your own, and others', trains.  Why load on another player's train?  Well, because you are rewarded with special actions - and they make all the difference.  Once you have a train, and some cargo, you can complete contracts - of which there are six, each corresponding to one of the main cities on the Island of Sodor Isle that is the namesake of the game.  We have played this a few times, and the decision making and action planning is great - especially for a small format game.  It takes about an hour to play, and it is an hour well spent.  One of the best things about the game, is that the great card art (by Daniel Guidera and Christopher Kirkman) is fantastic, and very reminiscent of a Little Golden Book (especially The Train to Timbuctoo and The Little Red Caboose).Continental Express is also a small format card game.  This one is from Asmodee, and is packed in a really nice tin box, similar to another of their titles, The Builders: Middle Ages.  They have several other titles in this same format of small tin box (Noah, Souk, Cardline: Animals, Cardline Dinosaurs, and Cardline: Globetrotter), however The Builders and Continental Express seem to be the most mature of these.  In this game, as in Isle of Trains, you are constructing a train.  However, that is the goal of this one - building the train.  You collect sets of cards, drawn from a pool of available cards each turn, and then turn them in for new cars on your train.  Each new car card has a train line symbol, and there are bonus point categories for those symbols.  Not a bad little game, and set collection is always a good mechanism.  The artwork is gorgeous, although closer to the Ticket to Ride artwork, than it is to other styles.More coming on other titles, but this is enough for now. . . ."},
{"title": "Assorted gaming projects and activities - an update", "date": "Monday, April 13, 2015", "text": "Several things have been going on lately, in the Gaming sphere of life at GwC headquarters.  Here is a rundown...Cold Wars - I attended Cold Wars last month - it was a touch and go decision up until the last minute, and it wasn't helped by the fact that there was a dreadful blizzard on the day I was supposed to leave.  I left the next day, and still had a great time.I met up with Chris and a bunch of the folks from Maryland, and further north, who game together at the HMGS shows - I have played with them a bunch in the past, but mostly it was Warhammer Ancients.  Patrick, of course, was there - as were Mike and Gil and some others.I got to participate, as a viewer/heckler and Referee's assistant (glorified title for flipping a few initiative cards) in some really compelling games of Muskets and Tomahawks from Studio Tomahawk (the fine folks who publish SAGA).  I bought a copy of the rules, and the cards, etc, from Steve at Age of Glory- a great fellow to deal with.Painting - I have begun collecting some new paints.  I have wanted, for some time, to experiment with using artist acrylics, entirely, for a project - and then assessing what the finished look is like, compared to using gamer paints (like Vallejo or Reaper), or craft paints (like Folk Art or Apple Barrel).  The brand I have selected is Liquitex.  I went with the Basics line, rather than the Heavy Pigment line.  I have used some of the colors from their Heavy Pigment artist line before - notably Titanium White and Cadmium Red (for 19th century Egyptians and British Red Coats, respectively, because I wanted bold bright colors, and I wasn't getting that from the craft paints I was using at the time).  The results for me were excellent, and so I wanted to follow up by purchasing a full palette of colors to use for an upcoming project.  I went ahead and got the 24 color starter set - the additional colors in the 36 color and 48 color sets did not really inspire me too much as being necessary for an experiment in a new medium.  I did wander outside of the Liquitex range for some other colors I will need - notably, I picked a light terracotta color from the Winsor & Newton line, to use as a basis for flesh.  I plan to try this out on a unit or two of Vikings, either for SAGA, or Lionheart, or both.Boardgames - Many new card games and board games over the past few months, since Christmas, mostly from Kickstarter rewards and a few trades and purchases.  I have begun writing an article about new Train titles at GwC headquarters, and will publish that shortly.  Played a few titles on the week leading up to Tabletop Day, but did not participate in any activities this year (we were on a spring break trip, and returned too late to host a game day, or attend the activities at the local game shop).  Some of the titles played recently included Salmon Run, On the Underground, and Valley of the Kings.  Loads of boardgames on the iPad, but hey - that don't count. Wargaming - There has been, of late, a resurgence in interest in Wargaming in the Department of Defense, and a number of professional developments for me are underway, where I am participating in wargaming design, the re-purposing of models and simulators for wargaming, and also teaching my Combat Modeling class.  Not really hobby oriented, but hey - steel sharpens steel.Roleplaying - I have taken up the flung gauntlet from John, in following on his Village of Hommlet game, in the World of Greyhawk.  I have the players investigating the circumstances (which, of course, includes a DUNGEON) around the mysterious deaths of three brothers, who were Knights from Veluna, who came with Prince Thrommel to fight the army of evil at the battle of Emridy Meadows.  The Knights, distracted by the youngest one who fell in love with a Village girl near Nulb, disappeared before the battle of Emridy Meadows took place.  Now, ten years later, the players were traveling through the region, on their way north from Hommlet, and they came across tales and rumors.  The game so far has focused on the upper level of the Dungeon they uncovered in the forest glade where the Brothers were laid to rest - but who killed them?  What happened to the girl?  How come two of the three graves are empty?  The game is going well, although we only play about 1-2 times a month.  Conventions - I have been helping, and will continue to help with the ODMS conventions in Williamsburg.  Some of the Staff have had medical problems and the remaining crew needs the help.  Also, I plan to attend Fall In next November (I can't wait).  I don't know about Historicon (family travel the week before, and the week after, will leave that weekend pretty tied up), but have been thinking about \"The Weekend\".  Does that event's name sound like an M Night Shyamalan movie to anyone but me?  Also, planning on attending Congregate in Greensboro NC this summer, working staff for the Con Suite.  Plan to do some heavy gaming while there, as well.That is all, for now, will report back soon, and hopefully the Train Game article will come around quickly."},
{"title": "The Twelve Plays of Christmas", "date": "Saturday, January 3, 2015", "text": "Christmas is a wonderful, unique time of the year - centered around the modern interpretation of a Christian Holy festival.  At Gaming with Chuck headquarters, we do many of the things (both religious and non-religious) that others do - we decorate the house, celebrate with family time and food, immerse ourselves in medieval Carols, as well as Victorian and modern songs, and try to spend time with friends, as well as much more family time than the rest of the year. Celebrating the birth of Christ with as much joy as we can muster.During this time, one of the ways we spend our relaxation time together is (of course) by playing games.  So, once the weeks of the Advent started ticking down, and vacation times started, we started having multiple opportunities for board game sessions.  I wanted to get at least twelve good plays in this year (the \"Twelve Plays of Christmas\"), and if you count everything (including card fillers, etc) between the Saturday of December 13 (the weekend when vacation time for me started), up through January 1, we had 28 games.For a list, check out these Board Game Geek stats. Now, granted, at least 8 of those plays were lightweight filler games, but that still leaves a respectable amount.  I didn't get to play some of the heavier Euros I like to play, and no wargames included, but this was Family time, and Friend time, and we did get in some pretty respectable titles, regardless.Breaking it down by Title, here is the list (from most plays to least plays):Shadows over Camelot (3)Trans Europa (3)Yardmaster (3)Guillotine (2)Power Grid: The First Sparks (2)Sushi Go! (2)Ticket to Ride: 10th Anniversary (2)Carcassonne (1)Category 5 (1)Easy Breezy Travel Agency (1)Flash Point: Fire Rescue (1)Lords of Waterdeep (1)Munchkin Adventure Time (1)Pandemic: The Cure (1)Salmon Run (1)Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries (1)Trekking the National Parks (1)Valley of the Kings (1) This did not include iPad plays of Ticket to Ride, Agricola, Stone Age, and Lords of Waterdeep (of which there were many, especially of the first two).Of this list, some of these titles were new.  Here is a brief comment on those that are new to the staff at Gaming with Chuck:Yardmaster - We got this title recently, benefits of a Kickstarter campaign.  It is a great little card game, with a nice industrial age Train theme, and we like it a lot.  Also came with Yardmaster Express,which we have not tried yet, but also looks good (and even shorter time to play).  Played a three way game with myself and two other competitive card players - it was quite tight and close scoring. Very satisfying.Power Grid: First Sparks - We have owned this for a few years, but with the move last year, and other things going on, this is one of those titles that has been waiting to be played.  We finally tried it, and we like it.  Compares well with Power Grid - simpler, less complex economy, but much shorter playing time.  A good trade off - makes both very attractive, for different reasons.Sushi Go! - This one was a Christmas gift for a good friend, and as we all enjoy drafting games, we thought we would like it.  I think we liked it more than our friends did!  Lightweight, but plays in a few short moments, and would be a good \"set the mood\" game for something deeper.Easy Breezy Travel Agency - This is the first of the six pack in Dice Hate Me's \"54 Card Rabbits\" series, that we received recently (again, compliments of a Kickstarter campaign).  This is a really fun little game.  There might be a strategy hidden here, but it seems like it is over too quick for someone to get bent out of shape over not finding it.  Fun, and fast.Munchkin Adventure Time - We don't care for Munchkin too much at GwC headquarters, however we do love Adventure Time - so this was a good compromise.  The character cards seem to be just right, and the many, many references (some esoteric) to elements of the TV show had us all giggling.  Played with a youngster, a teenager, and several adults - all fans of the show - as well as an older friend who didn't know what it was.  All of us loved it, regardless, and had a great Munchkin game (Editor: is there such a thing?) in the process.Pandemic: The Cure - The staff at Gaming with Chuck are split on Pandemic.  Actually we are split on cooperative games in general.  Meaning, I like them, and the Mrs does not.  However, given that this (the Pandemic dice game) plays fast, is very interesting, and isn't too terribly cooperative, it was quite fun, and still didn't feel like a bunch of individual solitaire games going on (like, say, the Catan dice game, or some others).Trekking the National Parks - This one is pretty fun.  It is a draw cards and move game, with the goal of getting Park card by visiting parks on the map, and turning in sets of cards.  Or is it a move around and collect stones to have the largest amount of certain colors?  Or is it a collect post cards, and then turn them into VPs by playing sets of cards?  Any of these three things seem like a reasonable path to victory in this deceptively simple (but fun) game about our national park system.  Very fun - drew many comparisons to Ticket to Ride - I felt like it was of an older Alan Moon vintage - one of his Elfen games.Valley of the Kings - We have played this one a few times now - during this recent Christmas period, and a few times back around Thanksgiving.  It is a great little deck builder, with some innovative mechanics.  We love it - the theme, the play, the length of time, all of it.  Some really neat ideas for different strategies, but the strongest seems to be concentration on a particular category or two.  Not sure about timing of the collection of scoring cards (unlike Dominion, etc - this one has you removing cards from play in order to have them count as final scoring artifacts).  Is it better to score all throughout, or to get some big stuff at the end?  Will have to play more to experiment."},
{"title": "Thanksgiving Gaming pt 2", "date": "Saturday, November 29, 2014", "text": "The holiday was fantastic!  Not only a great time of thanks, and fellowship - visiting friends, wonderful meals, relaxation and conversation - but also a great time for some gaming!Of the original list from Part 1 of this article, three of the games (Pigpen, X-Wing, Age of War) were not played.  But the other three were, along with some other games that we played and tried out.Trans-America was a lot of fun.  We played two times, one with four players, and one with six players.  Fun each and every time.  Originally a title from Winsome Games (as Iron Road), we have the printing from Rio Grande games (and Trans-Europa, along with the Vexation add-on).There was a game of Valley of the Kings - all of the players were new to the game (including yours truly - my first time playing).  We picked up on it pretty well.  By the third or fourth time around the table, all four players had the hang of things, and had a grasp on the \"entomb\" focus of the game.  The end score, however, was a little spread out.  Top scorer had 45 points, two middle scorers had 26 and 27, and bottom scorer had 16.  Closer next time, I'm sure.There was a seven player game of Elder Sign, where the intrepid adventurers ventured into the haunted museum One More Time to do battle with the minions of some outre, alien being.  Lots of dice rolling, tension, etc, and a win just in time.There was a mad, mad round of Walk the Plank.  Further comment prohibited by the decency board.A really good game (four player) of Lords of Waterdeep happened.  Great time.  We did not use the expansion, but probably could have, for more mayhem.The game about the Justice League, defending the Watchtower, that is available only from Target - Justice League: Axis of Villains - was brought out.  It is a super hero themed Fortress Defense game, only this time four of the members of the Justice League (Batman, Superman, Green Lantern and the Flash) are working hard to keep a batch of DC Comics villains away.  Lots of fun, and I got to be Green Lantern, one of my favorites.  (why is there no Aquaman in the game?)Finally, there was a game of Pandemic, to round out the board games.  As with Waterdeep and Elder Sign, none of the expansions available were used, but the base game (this time with four players) was quite good regardless. The roles we had were Dispatcher, Scientist, Medic and Researcher.  We played at the basic (Introductory) level, and we barely won.  The Player Deck was about to run out, even though we already suffered through the four Epidemics.We also were treated to a short run through of Adventure Maximus - a (sort of) mix between a roleplaying game and a card driven strategy game (although in this case, it is fantasy adventure in a sort of Adventure Time type setting).  Very much fun."},

{"title": "The power of Theme for Boardgames", "date": "Monday, November 10, 2014", "text": "So, just recently, I attended another session of the Fredericksburg Game Guild - this time it was a Sunday night meetup at the local game store - Game Vault.First, a few kind words about Game Vault.  A very nice store.  I met the owner (Cathy) as well as some of the guys who work behind the counter.  Knowledgeable about games and gaming, certainly willing to entertain different opinions and interests, and eager to help a customer.  The store is clean, has all that a game store needs (drinks, bathroom, plenty of game space, lots of in-stock product, nice environment, and handfuls of gamers in the store doing what that tribe does...).  I enjoyed my time there, and will likely be back.Second, the game we played - Stone Age.  Great game, from Rio Grande games (originally Hans Im Gluck, but I have the first English edition, from RGG, from 2009).  Worker placement, dice for tension, lots of win strategies - what's not to like?  And a ton of caveman jokes.But playing Stone Age got me thinking.  Along the lines of the theme idea we had during our last gameday at the house - where we combined three games, to come up with a melded theme.  The games were Age of War, TransAmerica, and Trains - melding the themes of Japan (Age of War and Trains) with Railroad Building (TransAmerica and Trains).Theme is separate from mechanics, but theme is important also.  At least to us here at Gaming With Chuck HQ, its important.  So I started thinking about picking a theme (as in the case of Stone Age - primitive man, prehistory, caveman - you choose one), and then trying to come up with three games (of different types of mechanics) to go along with that theme.Sticking with Prehistory, lets go with:1. Stone Age (worker placement)2. Settlers of the Stone Age (civilization building)3. Fossil (set collection)Equally, just pulling from titles that either are currently, or used to be, part of the GwC library - these could have also been counted in:4. Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers (tile laying)5. Bitin' Off Hedz (roll and move, racing)6. Neolithibum (dexterity)7. Triassic Terror (area control)8. Sticks & Stones (wargame)9. Trias (area control)10. Og (wargame)11. Dino Hunt (dice push your luck)  - probably some others I am forgetting...Depending on the group, I might include Carcassonne: Hunters and Gathers in for Fossil.  If I wanted to shorten the session, I might include Dino Hunt instead of Settlers of the Stone Age.  All of these have a similar (or at least within the same family) theme - but very different mechanisms.  Even the similar ones - such as both Sticks & Stones and Og being hex-and-counter wargames - they are very different from each other."},
{"title": "Boardgame Meetup - Fredericksburg Game Guild", "date": "Friday, November 7, 2014", "text": "I attended my first meetup with the Fredericksburg Game Guild last night, which met at the England Run Library, in Fredericksburg.  The Group gets together several times per week and per month, for different meetings in different venues - and the individuals I met last night seem like it is a very good group.England Run Library - the meeting rooms are down the hallway you can see to the right.The shortcoming of the weeknight meeting at the library, of course, is that it is time constrained.  They meet from 6-9, which isn't a bad length for a meeting, but about 1 hour too short, if you want to play two meaty games.  It is time, however, for a reasonable length game, and maybe a short filler or two.Last night I played two different titles, one new to me, and one somewhat familiar.  The first was the new title - Room 25.  The folks in the game were really excited because the theme is evidently based on the very successful and very popular trilogy of Cube movies.  I don't know anything about them, sadly.  However, I get the gist of the game.The people I played with were extremely friendly and fun to play with.  The guy who owned the game, and introduced it to us, was very pleasant and did a good job of introducing the rules.  The game, however, was one I probably won't play again.  As I mentioned in my notes on Board Game Geek, this was a perfect example of a game session where \"I loved the group, and had a good time, but I wasn't really crazy about the game.\"Components of the game Room 25 *The components of the game were excellent, and the idea (using programmed movement to explore a maze that the players have to escape from, together) was pretty good.  I like how 1 or 2 of the group members might be working for the Prison Guards.  But overall, there just didn't feel like there was enough going on.  And it felt like the end game was decided a priori.  In both our sessions, there was little (or nothing) that one side or the other could do about changing the endgame situation, over the last 3 or 4 turns of the game.  And considering that once the endgame mechanism is triggered, there are 5 or fewer turns left, that is not so good in my opinion.  Maybe an expansion will come out that will change things, or a similar theme but different mechanics.  I hold out hope to become impressed enough to play again.The second game that I got to play was... Glass Road.  This is a great game by Uwe Rosenberg.  Unlike many of his other titles, this is one that could be played in as short as an hour or so, by experienced players.  There is a lot going on with this game, with a very large decision space, and a lot of potential strategies that the player could take, in order to try to win.  It has great components, terrific theme, and excellent mechanics (with some innovations too).Layout of game, showing player map of countryside, with terrain tiles and building tiles *The theme is basically, the players are all competing manufacturing interests in Medieval Germany, building up the facilities and resource sources to enable them to be profitable manufacturers of glass and bricks (similar processes with similar resources required).  Game play is in turn, selecting roles, and then carrying out actions related to those roles.  Actions involved either collecting resources, modifying the consist of your local countryside (filling in ponds, digging sand pits, harvesting forests), and then building facilities that benefit you in some way.  Great game, as always, and a bit lighter than other Rosenberg titles.Setting up to play - from Game night at Moxie (Columbus, GA)The very clever resource clocks - also from Game night at Moxie (Columbus, GA)I had a great time playing, with three other players all of whom were new to me, and will always happily play this one again in the future.Overall, the meetup was a great success for me.  I met some really nice local gamers - some of whom are also Roleplayers and Wargamers - and I plan to attend some more in the future!  Hopefully next time I'll get to teach a game or two to some people.  Nothing is better about the gaming hobby, than sharing with other fans. * = These images are from Board Game Geek"},
{"title": "Boardgaming Evening", "date": "Monday, November 3, 2014", "text": "Gaming with Chuck HQ (now in historic Stafford Virginia - \"George Washington played Settlers of Catan Here!\") was recently a scene to a pleasant autumn Boardgaming evening.  All of the staff members (and two of the staff cats) were present, as well as a local visitor.  We originally had three things on the menu, bringing together a nice suite of themes and different styles games.  The original plan was to play Reiner Knizia's Age of War dice game from Fantasy Flight, also Franz-Benno Delonge's Trans America, and finally capping it with Hisashi Hayashi's great deck building game, Trains.The thinking was this - these are three very different games, mechanically.  But the themes were the connective tissue.  Age of War is themed for Feudal Japan.  Trans America is themed for Rail Empire building.  And Trains is themed for Rail Empire building in Japan.  Voila - secret sauce is made!  The mechanics, however, are what made the mix very interesting.Age of War is mechanically a dice game that preserves the same structure of the game Risk Express.  Now, this same mechanic found its way into Elder Sign, but in that game, the simple \"assign dice to targets; complete all targets to capture a goal\" mechanic is complicated with many, many different options (some goals require targets to be completed in order; many different benefits exist to help the player such as equipment and spells; extra targets can creep into a goal, in the form of monsters; there is a whole meta game around the basic mechanic; etc.).  But, since the admirable dice game, Risk Express was on the \"to acquire\" list for Gaming with Chuck HQ for quite some time, this new version out (with a feudal Japanese theme, no less) is very welcome.  And as a game it does not disappoint - it is a pretty easy game, simple to play, and fast turns, but there is enough strategy going on, and possible paths to winning, that there is some amount of decision making - a bit more than many dice games, a lot less than many more complicated games. Just enough to make you feel as if you are waging a campaign to capture the country.Age of War - excellent components, in a small box. *Trans America is mechanically a network building game.  It has a rail empire theme, but unlike many railroad themed games, there is no concept of cargo or passengers to pick up and carry.  The focus on railroading in Trans America is much more strategic than that of merely pushing cargoes around - it is of building a network of rails to connect cross-continental cities.  As a game, it is pretty simple to explain and play, but it still has some good decision making built into it - chiefly of timing.  As in - do you push and build your own network, or concentrate somewhere else and rely on your opponents to fill in the network infrastructure that you can also make use of , later?  A fun game, and if there were such a thing as Trans Japan, we might have tried that, to fit in with the theme.  There is a Japanese tie in for the game - in 2002, Trans America won the Japan Boardgame Prize for Best Foreign Game for Beginners.  Something interesting to look out for - a document of 20 different Trans America variants.  Mixed in with the Vexation variant (which typically ships with Trans Europa), there is lots there to complicate or change this simple little decision making game.Excellent components from Trans America - Dinner table accessories, not included. *Once we played Age of War and Trans America, however, we then broke for dinner (excellent Chinese food), and decided to watch Dr. Who.  We'll get to play Trains next time, I'm sure.  I wanted to bring up the mix, because I thought there were some interesting aspects to the three games we had originally planned for.  More game days are definitely needed.Trains - next time, definitely. ** = images from Board Game Geek."},
{"title": "Traveller Amber Zone - Sword Dance", "date": "Monday, July 7, 2014", "text": "There was a good looking Amber Zone contest over at Amber Zone.  Unfortunately, with my travels (real life) lately, I missed the submission date.Here it is - set inside one of the two super powers on the balkanized world of Margesi in the Vilis subsector of the Spinward Marches.Amber Zone - Sword Dance (1105, Margesi/Vilis)Location: Western edge of the Chergen Mountains, in People's Republic of Gome (PRoG)Patron: Commander Sinew, Imperial Naval Intelligence, contacting the travellers clandestinely, in the Kingdom of Evariidi, or perhaps the Margesi starport.Mission: Travel to the western edge of the Chergen Mountains, contact some of the local clans of Chergen cossacks, who never fully assimilated into the People's Republic.  One in particular, Katrinka the Knife, has agreed to serve as a guide.  She knows the location of a Sword World Military cache buried underground, at the old Gram Star-Militia troop site - situated to provide a training cadre for the capitol city of Isenstadt, on the other side of the Mountains.  When Gram controlled Margesi for the Sworld Worlders, Isenstadt was the world capitol, and home of the main starbase.  The cache has unknown amounts of military supplies buried in protected containers, but of interest to the Imperial Naval Intelligence, are some memory tanks with technical details of a Sword World missile frigate being designed 20 years ago, and now coming into production.Payoff: The Intelligence officer will offer some consideration in removing past offenses from the records of the travellers, and also agrees that they can keep half of all the military stores they uncover, with the other half going to Katrinka the Knife, and her band of Cossack warriors.Complications: The location is deep inside a militarized Soviet style country that is still very loyal to the Sword World, even though 20 some years ago, the planet came back into Imperial protection.  Also, the location is rural and hazardous (the cache is in a rocky highland valley).  Dealing with the Cossacks is not going to be easy, and in fact, to prove themselves the players will have to spend a night successfully carousing with the band (Carouse or Liaison skill test to be successful), and one of the members of the group will have to try the sword dance (Art: Dance, modified by Dex).  Three dice rolls are required, of successful harder difficulties (6+, 8+, 10+) representing faster and faster Cossack music.  If the player passes all three, the Cossacks are completely loyal allies, lesser results will have the Cossacks being less tightly allied to the players.Reaching the cache is tough enough (survival and mountaineering may be required), but occasional patrols of PRoG solders (flak, autorifle, hand grenades) may cause additional problems.  The extremely rough terrain precludes the use of long-range radio, but after 2 or 3 days the loss of PRoG army patrols will be noticed.The cache is underground, inside a small bunker complex.  Katrinka knows the location of the entrance, but not how to get in.  The complex is protected by a series of TL10 security measures.  The stash includes the digital memory tanks for the Intelligence officer, as well as dozens of TL10 small arms; cloth armor; ammo; and most important, a dozen each of TL10 communicators and TL10 medikits.The special challenge for the travellers, will be escaping with the goods.  On the way out of the area, with whatever stash they can carry on horseback (or vehicles if they risk it), they (and Katrinka's band of cossacks) will be attacked by another band of Cossacks, intent on thieving the goods.  They will be armed with a variety of small arms, but not grenades or armor.  They make up for their lack of armor in excellent ambush skills and fieldcraft."},
{"title": "Theremin Thursdays - two Mashups, one musical, one wargaming", "date": "Thursday, June 19, 2014", "text": "It has been a while since a Theremin Thursdays entry has been made here at Gaming with Chuck.  This entry is being made because of two different things coming together that I want to write about.  The first is a cool (actual Theremin) mashup music piece I came across, and the second is a gaming item that is as much a mashup as the first.Mashup Number One - MusicalSo the first (musical) mashup is this . . . a room full of lovely musicians, playing Beethoven's Ode to Joy, using Theremins inside Matryoshka Dolls.  It's just so wonderful . . . sort of like Astronaut Bowman looking into the Stargate and seeing all those stars. . .So, evidently that group is a Matryomin (Matryoshka Theremin) ensemble.  I can't think of two things that are possible cooler to mashup than Matryoshka's and Theremins.  Except . . .Mashup Number Two - WargamingThe second mashup here is one of wargaming.  A friend of mine (Geo) and I had been talking about a couple of different 15mm wargaming projects.  These have come together in an unlikely way.The first one was fictional forces in a modern African setting, with countries, coups, warlords, and international forces bashing over temporary objectives and unlikely ideological clashes - in short, the game \"AK47 Republic\" by Peter Pig.  We started assembling miniatures, coming up with backgrounds for our forces, and in general securing the ideas for a gaming setting and some battles to fight.  The second one is wargaming with 15mm science fiction forces in the Traveller universe.  I had recently been running a table top Traveller RPG game (although only a few sessions before my schedule kicked into high gear), with details over at The Collace Rift.  Still in a Traveller mood, we started talking about wargaming - and began assembling forces, painting miniatures, talking about former battles, etc.Then it happened - local conflicts on worlds within the Third Imperium (Traveller) resemble the brush wars described by AK47 Republic, but with the addition of some different levels of technology, and the attendant science fiction hardware.  But, what if we kept the battles MOSTLY to the tech levels of, say, 5,6,7,8 (corresponding to the military hardware of, respectively, WW1, WW2, 1960s, 1990s) - then we would be right on target for the wide variety of forces found in AK47 Republic.  But, if it was going to be in the Traveller Universe, then it needed a planet.Enter, Margesi - a world on the edge of Imperial space, that was (until recently) contested, and controlled by the Sword World Confederation.  The world is balkanized, many a bunch of competing governments. After checking what the Traveller Wiki has to say, it appears that there are (conveniently enough) two super powers, the Kingdom of Evariidi and the People's Republic of Gome.  Having also posited that there would be any number of smaller nations, allied to one or more of those super powers, we have the third world setting of Earth, transposed to another world.  To make things even more interesting, we made the two super powers being aligned with the two interested Interstellar Governments - the Kingdom of Evariidi is the current ascendant power, and is backed by the Imperium (clandestinely), but the world's Starport (Margesi Down Station) is located within the Kingdom, and is operated by Imperial Starport Authority.  The other nation, the People's Republic of Gome (representing Brezhnev-era Soviet style rule), is backed (clandestinely) by the Sword World Confederation.The world of Margesi, in the Vilis subsector of the Spinward MarchesThe nations identified on the map are those identified by the last Imperial Interstellar Scout Service survey of the world, and most likely will include any number of smaller entities, and may have shifted or changed those listed.  The world map features hexes that are 160km across, to give you a sense of the size of the planet - somewhat smaller than earth.  Here is a list of nations.A.

{"title": "Lots of Boardgaming recently", "date": "Wednesday, June 11, 2014", "text": "There has been a lot of boardgaming in recent months for the staff of GwC.This includes the local weekly boardgame night at Moxie games (the game store here in Columbus) every Wednesday.And the weekly Saturday meetup somewhere around town with the Meeples of Columbus.And, while school was in session, there was the monthly Boardgaming session in the Computer Science department of Columbus State University.And there was the Atlanta Game-o-Rama - which the entire staff, minus cats, attended for all five days.Coming up in July, there will be ConGregate, which the staff intends on invading for the purpose of helping out in the Con Suite, and also encourage the proper application of Boardgaming.Through all this, there have been a number of new titles that have made their way into the GwC repertoire as regular games.One of the most commonly played, lately, has been Lords of Waterdeep.  Great worker placement game.  Extremely well balanced, and lots of different ways to get what you need - which is victory points from fulfilling quests (achieved by collecting adventurers, by applying your workers to different worker collection schemes).Waterdeep.  From http://deusuum.deviantart.com/art/Waterdeep-Nights-158933817 Lots of tablet play of Le Havre (on the iPad) had been taking place lately, and a tabletop showing is scheduled for an upcoming Wednesday night.  Speaking of the great Uwe Rosenberg, the staff of GwC recently played some extremely satisfying games of Agricola, including some teaching games (for new players) at Game-o-Rama.  Also, one of the newer Rosenberg titles, Glass Road, is scheduled to make an appearance soon.I'll take the wood option.At the most recent (June 7) Saturday meetup, two new games came out of hiding - Suburbia by Ted Alspach, and also Portobello Market, in the Playroom gateway games series.  Suburbia is a great strategy player's game, again with lots of ways to victory.  Portobello Market is a game of building (in this case, market stalls), not too deep, but sort of fun.Stalls at Portobello Market in the 1950s, fifty years after our game ended.A recent, coveted acquisition is that of the Mayfair edition of Cosmic Encounter (with the supplement, More Cosmic Encounter).  These two boxes recreate everything that Eon ever did with the original.  One problem?  The cards are somewhat worn.  So, against the usual practice and policy of the Games Archivists and Librarians Guild here at GwC, these cards have actually been put into sleeve protectors.From BGG - perhaps the best version of the game?This Wednesday's game night (June 11) is due to include a first time playing of Russian Railraods by Ohley and Orgler.  Definitely looking forward to that.Real Russian Railroad.  Note the lack of strategy gamers.Saturday is due to include some Boss Monster, played recently, and fun enough that it is worth promoting and teaching to others.  Also, the new word game, Concept.  Both of these are lots of fun, and worth spreading around.  Concept could easily become a gateway game to those who like party games and word games.Just imagine how awesome a version of Boss Monster would be with Don Bluth art, a la Dragon's Lair"},
{"title": "Williamsburg Muster - accidental convention trip", "date": "Tuesday, February 18, 2014", "text": "So, recently, I had to tell folks that asked that I was not going to be able to attend Marscon and the Williamsburg Muster.  Both in Williamsburg, Virginia (one of my favorite places on Earth, even though Scribner's is closed since 1984, Rizzoli's is closed since 2001, and the Williamsburg Toymaker has recently closed - sniff), they would prove just too far, since we are living in Harris County Georgia currently, at Toad Hollow.And then, and then, it happened.  A work trip, a family visit, all coincided.  So I would be in the area over the weekend of the Williamsburg Muster (Feb 7-9).  I decided to attend.  I took a flight to arrive on Friday, so I wouldn't have much luggage room for buying, and I did not bring any games or miniatures with me, but I was looking forward to a good time.Lots of miniature games (a very solid collection of games, although I did not notice anything appreciably exciting or new...maybe I was not in the right place at the right time).  There was a board gaming room, ran very capably by Tidewater Area Gaming Society, although some of their peeps were also supporting Whose Turn is it Anyway? (the winter version of That Board Gaming Thing) in Raleigh NC.  There was a Flames of War tournament room (which also doubled as part of the Flea Market room on Sunday).  There was a room given over to Slot Car racing (??what??).  (ed. note: Slot car racing is a great hobby, and I used to love going to races with my dad and my uncle when I was a wee little sprog, but I don't know what it adds to a gaming convention)Watched lots of miniatures games.  The rules that I WANTED to play, but didn't make/find time for:War and ConquestPike and ShotteBolt ActionGeneral Quarters 3Watched and played a bunch of board games.  The games that I WANTED to play, but did not see, or did not engage in, were:TrainsRussian RailroadsA Study in EmeraldOra et LaboraGlass RoadTroyesWhat I did get to do was spend some time with some fantastic friends, and play a few board games and card games, and watch a lot of miniature games.  I got to do a lot of \"window\" shopping for miniatures and miniature rules.  And I got to buy a couple of books.First, I bought a copy of the main rulebook for War and Conquest.  This is a set of 28mm wargaming rules for Ancient and Medieval warfare, written by Rob Broom.  Rob was the director of the North America effort for Warhammer Historical games, so it has a certain feel to Warhammer Ancient Battles.One of the cool things about War & Conquest (WAC) is that the army lists for it are available in a very polished professional way, but online as electronic documents for free.  This is being published and supported by Scarab Miniatures.  I wish them well, with WAB gone (well, out of commercial production), a set of rules that is still \"in print\" is a nice thing, even if WAB itself still is available non-commercially and played quite a bit.One of the other acquisitions I made was a copy of Renaissance Warfare, edited by Bob Carruthers.  This is a nice collection of pieces about battles in the British Isles from 1513 through 1640.  It is extracted from a larger work, originally written by James Grant, and published in 1894, called British Battles on Land and Sea.This work, for me, is chiefly interesting because of the focus on the battles between the end of the Wars of the Roses (ended 1487) and the beginning of the English Civil Wars (beginning approx 1642).  The battles covered in this title are:Flodden, 1513Haddenrig, 1542Ancrum Moor, 1545 Isle of Wight, 1545Pinkie, 1547Siege of Leith, 1560Zutphen, 1586The Groyne, 1589Flores and Cape Corrientes, 1591Cadiz, 1596Porto Rico, 1598Bay of Cezimbra, 1602Cagliari, 1617Isle of Rhe, 1627Newburn Ford, 1640In addition there are treatments of Sir Francis Drake, Admiral Hawkins, and the Spanish Armada.  All of these are covered very sketchily, but as I did not have something concise on this period in my library, it serves as a nice introduction.  One complaint - it is in a series from Pen and Sword, called the \"Military History from Primary Sources\" series, and this is definitely not primary sources, although it is republishing a historical piece of military history writing (Grant's work from 1894).Two other pieces I picked up are two titles from Histoire & Collections.  These are fantastic little military history monographs, accompanied by a packed house full of illustrations.  Perfect for the armchair historian, or the wargamer, who is looking for inspirational images, and a thumbnail sketch of a campaign, or a particular army.  In this case, I got two titles from their \"Men and Battles\" series, very similar to the Osprey Campaigns series.  The two I got are Alesia, 52 BC, by Frederic Bey, and Rocroi, 1643, by Stephane Thion. The only other one I already own in the series is on Bull Run (purchased to help my Daughter with a school project on the battle... as I am not a huge fan of the American Civil War, for wargaming).  If you are not familiar with the Histoire & Collections publisher, they are from Paris, originally published in French, and their series' are now being translated into other languages (including English).  Very nicely done, and a nice complement to the many Osprey titles on popular topics, as a layman's introduction to military topics (again, great for Wargamers and Figure Painters... like those slaving away in the dungeons below Gaming with Chuck headquarters).Not to let Osprey be outdone completely by their French rivals, I did purchase an excellent new volume from them.  I got Campaign Series number 260, Fort William Henry 1755-57 which was just published in November of 2013.  This is an excellent treatment of the famous French & Indian War fort, built in 1755, and subjected to two sieges.  The second one finally saw British Lt. Col. Monro surrender to the French/Native American force that was besieging the fort, and the elements of the 35th Regiment, the Massachusetts Regiment and the New Hampshire Regiment (along with some carpenters, sailors, and elements of the Royal Artillery) prepared to march out.The ensuing \"Massacre of Fort William Henry\" occurred when the Native American troops in French command fell upon the column leaving the fort, and began to hack and kill the British and Colonial troops.  The battle is well recorded in the fantastic movie \"The Last of the Mohicans\", but as this title by Ian Castle points out, modern scholarship, and archaeology of the past 20 years, have brought to light some different details.  The scene, from the Daniel Day Lewis movie, however, is still a stirring piece of Hollywood militaria (regardless of what it gets wrong).The movie is a really nice piece of what Hollywood can accomplish as an action/history movie, although much of that is based on the inspiration of the fantastic Cooper novel.  One of the best things of the movie, commented on several times in the past here at Gaming with Chuck, is the great soundtrack by Trevor Jones.Several Violin soloists have done nice versions, to be found on youtube.  Here is one played by a talented young lady dressed as a Gypsy dancer at a renaisance faire (in the background of the video is another young lady dressed as the Genie from I Dream of Jeannie??).  Here, however, is one of my favorites by very talented Taylor Davis.All this talk of the Lewis film is all well and good, but the original book by Cooper is not to be missed. By all means, read it.  The movie referred to here (while good) is based much more on the 1936 (Randolph Scott) version of the story, than the Cooper novel.From a gaming perspective, doing French & Indian war miniatures has long been on my Miniatures Painting project list.  Perhaps soon. However, the boardgame Hold the Line from Worthington Publishing (formerly Worthington Games) has the French & Indian War supplement available.While the Fort William Henry Massacre isn't one of the scenarios in that expansion, there are a number of great battles included.  Very good game, and satisfyingly reminiscent of the period (and they get the history right, much better than Hollywood).Finally, the last treasure that I walked away from The Williamsburg Muster with was a copy of the fantastic treasure trove of information concerning the military activities of Prussia (and then Germany) in the period from 1860-1867.  The book, Armies of Bismarck's Wars: Prussia 1860-67, is by Bruce Bassett-Powell (2013 Casemate).  It is fantastic, with information on the German Bund, leading up to the Schleswig-Holstein war, the Second Schleswig War and the Seven Weeks war.  Information about the armies, politics, diplomacy, key personnel, and battles abounds, with lots of reproduced primary illustrations, and other information.  This is the first half of the book, the second is dedicated to describing the Prussian arms - organization, operational methods, and uniforms.  It is all finished with a large number of color uniform plates, and appendices on the OB information for Prussia, Denmark and so forth - for the 1864 and 1866 campaigns.  A great book, and  nice find.  Glad I was able to pick it up.Here is an example of one of the uniform plates from the book.  As you can see, a lot of great information, again, a perfect source for an armchair historian (although this book has a lot of very good, apparently sound from an academic perspective, information), and for a wargamer and figure painter.So, the final shot of this article is to say thanks to Larry Weindorf, now owner of \"For the Historian\" a military history (and military models) shop in Gettysburg Pennsylvania.  He is located at 42 York Street, Gettysburg, PA 17325.  He is a fantastic guy to deal with, and most of the books listed here were purchased from him.  He has supported the Williamsburg conventions (especially back when they were sponsored by ODMS, and I was partially responsible for running them) for years now, and is a dealer at other wargaming shows (notably the big HMGS shows in Fredericksburg and Lancaster).  Great guy, buy some books from him at http://www.forthehistorian.com/"},
{"title": "Original Dungeons & Dragons reprint, brings back great memories", "date": "Saturday, February 1, 2014", "text": "So, Wizards finally released the (announced over a year ago) Premium Edition of the Original Dungeons & Dragons set.New reprint of Original D&D - recently arrived at Gaming with Chuck headquarters (picture from WOTC website)This is the reprint, in the spirit of the other earlier edition reprints they have been doing, of the original white box version of Dungeons & Dragons, published once upon a time by TSR, thanks to the heroic writing and publishing efforts of the early greats of the industry - Gygax, Arneson, Blume, etc.The original game came with three booklets:Volume 1: Men & MagicVolume 2: Monsters & TreasureVolume 3: Underworld & Wilderness AdventuresBook one deals with building characters, and man-to-man combat, heavily dependent on ChainmailBook two, with (you guessed it) Monsters and TreasuresBook three with campaign and adventure rules and guidelinesFollowing its release in 1973, there was a flurry of excitement and reprints as the popularity of the game took the fledgling wargaming company by storm, but by 1975, the Supplement train was going strong, and the original release was supported by:Supplement I: GreyhawkSupplement II: BlackmoorSupplement III: Eldritch WizardrySupplement IV: Gods, Demi-Gods & HeroesThe new set was received at Gaming With Chuck headquarters during the recent Snowpocalypse, and that gave me some time off from teaching at the university to spend a few hours perusing these little gems of nostalgia.  All the rules, text, descriptions, charts, tables, examples, and interior art is just as it always was (or, at least, as I remember it).  The biggest changes came in - (1) extremely clear typesetting (although that wasn't too much of a problem with the TSR originals), and (2) new cover art for each book. Sigh.  I miss the cover art, but still, as a chance to get this reprint, it is okay that they changed it (I suppose).  Still, they didn't ask me. I would have voted for the original.The whole thing comes in a really nice dark wood box (with the stylized ampersand from the modernized game logo), with a felt lined well in the middle for the books, and smaller wells on both sides, to hold a large set of polyhedral dice.  I say large, because it also accommodates 4 d6, in addition to the rest.  This is very nice, and I dare say much, much nicer than the dice that I got with the redeemable coupon in my 1979 boxed set of Dungeons and Dragons.The dice I got from the hobby store in Huntington WV, with the coupon from my set of Basic D&DRereading it is exciting, and the descriptions of the monsters, spells, abilities, and adventure ideas are all grand.  But, I am struck by how spread out everything is.  Basic monster abilities (descriptions and hit dice) in one place.  Details about how many attacks (monsters can get multiple attacks?  Cool new rule...), and how much damage each does (not everything does the same damage? Cool new rule...), are all in different places.  The release of the canonical spells for Magic Users and Clerics are in different places.  The introduction of the Thief (a player can play a thief?  Cool new rule...) - all this and other stuff, spread out over the different books.Gathering all this, as well as \"official\" stuff that came out in The Dragon, and else where, was the reason for releasing the hardcover AD&D books.  It wasn't supposed to change the game (although it did) as much as it was supposed to make it easier for DMs and players to find all the stuff that came out in dribs and drabs over 7 books, and in magazine articles, etc.In between the release of the White Box set, and the full set of the first three Hardcover books (released, in order, as Monster Manual, Players Handbook, and Dungeon Master's Guide), there was the release of the first box set since the white box edition - the first Basic Dungeons and Dragons set.  This was edited by J. Eric Holmes, and was the set that I first purchased (and played, and played...).  It wasn't fantastic, or extremely thick, but it captured all the rules (mostly) needed to play initial adventures, from the three volume set of 1974, along with some of the additional materials (spells, monsters, rule changes) from the supplements.I had the 5th printing, identifiable because it came with adventure B1 and a coupon for diceThe edition I bought came with cut out chits for polyhedral dice randomization, and a coupon redeemable for dice (see picture above) from TSR at a local hobby store.  My set came from a small book story in Huntington WV, in the winter of 1979-80, called Nick's News.  There was a hobby store in town, where I had been buying some wargames (I bought both GEV and also the Hinchliffe Guide to Wargaming there, on my first trip), and had gotten interested in medieval miniatures (including some fantasy figures, in the Heritage \"Fantastiques\" line).  Then I saw the white box set, with the subtitle \"Rules for Fantastic Medieval Wargames Campaigns Playable with Paper and Pencil and Miniature Figures\". That was what I needed for my small, but growing, collection of medieval toy soldiers (including my first fantasy figures - a pack of beornings, that came with three Beorn-like figures and three bears).  But I also saw the first of the hard cover books, and a TSR rack of products - including some of the first packaged modules, the monster & treasure assortments, the geomorphs - all of it.The book cover of the rule book in the Holmes box set. I still have a copy, and it is great reading.It seemed to me that the 8x11 Holmes set would be a good bridge to the  hard cover books, and after all, it came with an adventure.  And - Oh! - what an adventure!  I got the fifth printing which came with B1 - In Search of the Unknown.  I STILL love that adventure.  And I can't think of anything better to teach a DM how to build their own dungeons.  It was a map, with room descriptions, and fill in the blank places for the newby DM to fill in monsters and treasures (complete with space for traps and containers), but the basic dungeon structure was done.  It was fantastic.  I was hooked - along with my two brothers, and anyone else we could get to play.Best intro module ever made, in my humble opinion.So, while WOTC has not reprinted the Holmes version of Basic D&D, they have done a good job of reprinting the White Box set, which is even more wonky, and more fun to read.  If they do a version of Basic D&D, honestly, I think I would rather have the Moldvay Version (Basic and Expert rulebooks), or the later B1-B5 version as it eventually ended up in the Rules Cyclopedia.  That was a fantastically complete ruleset, and loads of fun to play.  In the meantime, I think that the Labyrinth Lord game is a great modern replacement, and if you include the supplement Advanced Labyrinth Lord book, it is a pretty good replacement for both Basic D&D and also 1st Edition Advanced (this was the version we played over Labor Day Weekend at friends in 2013 - and my Daughter and Wife played in the same game, along with a pack of some of the best friends of the family who are all gamers).  Good times can still be had with this older version of the classic."},
{"title": "The Sword and the Flame - Hosted by GwC at Siege of Augusta 2014", "date": "Tuesday, January 21, 2014", "text": "So, the one miniatures game at the convention this past weekend that I hosted was a big game of The Sword and the Flame.It was set in the Sudan, with the forces of the Khalifa (successor to the Mahdi) on one side, and a combined Anglo-Egyptian relief force on the other side.  Here is the write up that was submitted to the fine folks running the convention:Name: \"Close Scrape in the Soodan\"Scale: 28mmRules: The Sword and the Flame 20thPlayers: 8Scenario: Khartoum has fallen, Gordon is Dead.  The Khalifa has taken over the vast, deadly army of the Mahdi's followers.  They are on a rampage, throughout parts of Egypt, seeking to eliminate any enemies of the Mahdist cause.  Famous Egyptologists Emerson and Peabody, having abandoned their dig site, returned to the small river village where they left their falucca, which was to carry them back out to the Nile, and to safety.  A company of Egyptian troops are within a short march of them, and a larger force of British troops are not much further away.  But, the forces of the Khalifa are drawing closer, closer, closer... The game settles around the possibility to rescue the team of scholars, with a combined Anglo-Egyptian force, and against them mobs and mobs of deadly Mahdist warriors.  Played in 28mm, using The Sword and the Flame.In the end, we had 5 players (Saturday night, when the game was hosted, is REALLY BUSY at Siege of Augusta, there were a zillion great looking games, and almost all of them were full).Two brave souls decided to run the forces of the Mahdists, and three played on the Anglo-Egyptian side.The table was 5' wide, by 12' long.  The center of the table had a smallish tributary of the Nile, crossed by two fords. The fords were both connected to roads, that ran off in the four different directions, off the table.  The rest of the table top was covered by sporadic rock formations, and patches of rough going.Along the tributary, there was a make shift defensive area, manned by the two Egyptologists (Amelia Peabody, and her husband Radcliffe Emerson), along with 10 hired guards.On one of the roads, near to the defensive area, was the Egyptian column.  It consisted of a company - 2 platoons - of infantry, a squadron of the Egyptian Camel Corps, and a krupp gun.Egyptian Captain (with standard bearer and bugler), eyeing the placement of the Egyptian Krupp GunOn two of the other roads, starting further away, were two companies of British soldiers (each with two platoons of infantry, no guns, no cavalry).Two platoons of British Infantry, from the Denbigh FusiliersArrayed against them was the Mahdist horde consisting of:5 units of Beja tribesmen (Fuzzy-wuzzies, fierce swordsmen, fanatics)3 units of Ansar sword infantry (Dervishes) 2 units of Ansar riflemen (hidden in some rock formations on the tabletop)3 units of Ansar mixed sword and spear infantry4 units of Ansar Cavalry (armed with a mix of sword and spear)2 unreliable ancient cannonsThe horde of Mahdist warriors, approaching the fords of the tributaryThe game would have really benefited from having the three additional players - one to play the guards and Egyptologists, and two more to play on the side of the Mahdists.  As it was, the two Mahdist players grouped up almost all their units on one end of the table, because that was where they set up.  I, as a referee, should have set the units out on the edge of the table rather than letting them choose... live and learn.  Here are some excellent photos, taken by Charles Cabell, of the Fort Mill Historical Gamers club.  All figures are 28mm, Old Glory, and painted by GwC host, Chuck Turnitsa.  The exception is the Egyptian Camel Corps, which are 25mm scale, and Ral Partha - painter unknown.Ansar leader directs the advance of the hordeBeja Tribesmen (Fuzzy Wuzzy) begin to mass, and move towards the ford over the tributary.Approaching the ford...Egyptian Infantry, standing their groundDervishes, coming out of the rocky country, approach the Egyptians from behindThe Hamilton Rifles, taking casualties from Ansar rifles, firing captured Snyder riflesThe Egyptian Camel Corps, in line abreast, ready to charge the DervishThe moment before the clash!What the Dervish Commander saw...The Fuzzy Wuzzy tribesmen prepare to charge the Denbigh FusiliersThe Charge!!

{"title": "flash review of Bolt Action (Osprey/Warlord)", "date": "Monday, January 20, 2014", "text": "I got to sit in on a Demo Game of Bolt Action at Siege of Augusta this past weekend.  The game was run by Charles Cabell, and it was extremely enjoyable.  Here is a really quick review of the game, and I should mention that I followed up by buying a copy of the rules from Time Portal Hobbies. Bolt Action is a joint venture between Warlord Games and Osprey publishing. Warlord writes the rules and makes the models, Osprey publishes the books.A word about the Osprey venture into rule publishing.  Each title might not be your cuppa tea, but they are all done nicely, I certainly like a few, they are using proven rules writers, the production is excellent, and the prices are far lower than the other rules publishers. Okay, the game is squad based (5-15 figures per squad). WW2. Maximum of 1 tank and 1 recon vehicle per side.  Turn goes by drawing activation markers out of a bag. Player picks a unit to activate, and chooses 1 of 6 commands (move, shoot, run, hold, etc). Warlord Games makes sets of colored dice to use as these activation markers, with the six sides corresponding to the six possible commands, so that everything is clearly marked on the table (see above picture).  Individual shooting and individual melee resolution by dice. Simple morale rules. Nice organization tables, for the big four (Germany, US, Russia, England).  Separate books (again, priced affordable) cover other belligerents and go deeper on the main crew. Well done, and supported by an excellent line of models from Warlord. Could be played any scale, even 54mm. Could stretch to other conflicts (Korea, WW1, Vulgarian Civil War).Decent skirmish game. Feels less gimmicky than Flames of War. Lots of product, but none will break the bank."},
{"title": "War of the Roses project officially started", "date": "Tuesday, January 14, 2014", "text": "Just last week, a package found its way down the frigid rivers of Balkania, via tramp steamer.  Once leaving the ice choked and alpine fringed waterways of the January landscape in that wartorn land, it made its way deep south, past the equator, into the Umbongo rain forest, to the Mission House at the rail head of the Trans-Umbongo railroad.  From there, it traveled by llama train to the heights of the Boruckistan mountains. Blessed in a monastery, the package was then sent by carrier vulture to GwC headquarters.What was in the package? Why, an Old Glory box containing the beginnings of the Lancastrian army project for the War of the Roses.  The initial order is enough to allow the building of three large units of billmen, and a pair of associated longbowmen units for each.  The billmen units will be 24 figures strong, mounted on six man stands.  The longbowmen units will be 12 figures strong each, mounted on three man stands.I received 60 bill armed figures; 60 bow armed figures; and 30 assorted command figures.  The unit consist for each of the billmen units is 20 bill armed figures, plus one standard bearer, one musician, one Nobleman, and one lesser Noble or Champion.  24 figures.  The consist for each of the six 12 figure longbowmen units is ten figures with longbow, one leader, and one musician.The official start of the project took place on Saturday past. I opened and began cleaning the longbow armed figures. Pictures will be forthcoming, chronicling the progress."},
{"title": "World War One miniatures - 1914/2014", "date": "Saturday, January 11, 2014", "text": "So, it is (as mentioned in the preceding post about Siege of Augusta) the year of Our Lord 2014.  That means one hundred years since the dreadful (but fascinating) conflict known as The Great War began in Western Europe with the machinations of the German Schlieffen Plan, and the response by Belgium, France, and Britain.This, of course, warrants a great deal of interest for wargaming, as well as general history reading.Historical MiniaturesOn the miniatures front, I have recently acquired a pair of early war armies, consisting of 180 French figures, one tank, and a number of machine guns for one side.  For the other, I have 190 German figures, some machine guns, and seven field guns.  Both of these forces are painted.  Which opens up the question of Rules. The first obvious choice is a variation of my Russian Civil War rules. Other possible choices are Square Bashing from Peter Pig; Volley and Bayonet; Over the Top; or a new set of rules written here at GwC HQ.The French and ~half (110 figures) of the Germans came from my friend Bob, who was going to sell them at a convention.  The other 80 German infantry, and the seven field guns, came from eBay.Early war German Infantry, via eBayField Guns - will be used for a variety of nationalities...also from eBayAs far as manufacture, the Germans certainly, and probably the French, are from Minifigs.  Minifigs early war Germans, with the Pickelhaub, are the best I have ever seen.  Funny, because I don't like their early war British figures at all.  I don't know who to deal with in the U.S. any longer for Minifigs, but the shipping terms from Spirit Games in the UK are always nice, and they carry the WW1 line.Balkanian ImaginationsIn a totally different scale, and focus, it turns out that the ImagiNations group that I am in, with the fictional states of Balkania at nearly constant war with each other, is also interested in 1914 wargaming. In this case, it is done in 54mm, using chiefly plastic figures.In the case of Balkania, it appears saber rattling has given way to Furstenburg arming and mobilizing under General Plan Number 14.2.  The various Balkanian ethnic groups (Urbiks, Suburbiks, Bosniaks, TransTurkylvanians) saw this as reason to take up arms themselves, in response to the earlier punitive conflict known generally as the Frontier Adjustment Wars. The target of Furstenburg Aggression? None other than The Kingdom of 2.5 Sicilys.Here is the original dispatch, from one of the Balkanian Gentleman in the group, describing the opening of the conflict....and the winds of war are stirring in Balkainia, according to the Gazette and Daily Post. The GADP reports that in an unusually energetic move, the Kingdom of 2.5 Sicilies is reorganizing and updating their mobilization plan. Rumored as Plan 14 1/4, it is designed to mobilize the military quickly and strike hard to recover the Lost Province brutally ripped from Balkainian Sicily by the Furstenberg led Third Coalition during the War of Frontier Adjustments, Part II. To that end all the painted figures (which look remarkably like 54mm plastic 1900 AIP French) have been rebased and terraformed, included appropriate command and artillery bases, into 3 Corps (if each base = 1 infantry or artillery regiment) or alternatively 1 division (if each base = 1 infantry or artillery battalion). Only two guns and 4 gunners remain to be converted to 1914, primed and painted for the mobilization of these Corps to be complete.An order for these two guns has been placed with the Schnidely Cannon and Ordnance Works Ltd (SCOWL). Along with 4 additional guns for export to other Minor Powers (e.g., the Bosniaks, Suburbiks, and the Turklyvanians have all expressed an interest), 6  field guns are in the process of being completed by the SCOWL. Once the gun shields and a few other details have been added,  they will be ready for priming...Alas, intelligence reports that the Furstenbergers have been busy rebasing and terriforming their troops as well. Due to concerns of a two-front war looming with the Vulgarian Empire, the Furstenbergers rebased and terraformed enough painted soldiers (that bear a remarkable resemblance to 1914 Germans) to creat 4 Corps (!). The 3 Regular Corps have almost all their artillery, while the Reserve Corps is equipped with the older non-quick firing breech-loaded guns. All the Corps are missing their Corps HQs (the political rivalries among the Great Squash and Pumpkin Families are holding things up...). The remaining 3 field guns and 3 howitzers for the Regular Corps have be ordered from Ackerwerks Gmb (rumored to be controlled Behind the Scenes by none other than the Karltoe Armaments Ltd; a rumor denied by both organizations).Both sides are recruiting the associated cavalry, jaegers/chasseurs (foot and cyclist), and other specialists need to complete the forces.With all this warlike activity can another war of Frontier Adjustment, Part II be long delayed?I should point out that Gaming with Chuck staff are considering ordering some Armies in Plastic figures, to be painted up as TransTurkylvanians and Vulgarian Imperial Infantry.  For the great TransTurko-Vulgar War, as well as for use in 1914.  The TransTurko-Vulgar war (fought in the 1870s) was a natural carry over from the Crymea River war, where the Imperial Vulgarian army was stopped from conquering Suburbik homelands within the TransTurkylvanian Empire.  The troops that took part in the great Suburbo-Vulgar war could easily be reused for 1914, in a pinch.  The figures are also available from Armies in Plastic.Vulgarian Empire InfantryTransTurkylvanian InfantryOnce painted up, the Vulgarian infantry will be in their typical White and Green uniform, as seen here in this picture of painted figures from the Toy Soldier Company.And here is an alternate view, all in green (as some Vulgarian units were so equipped).Finally, some pictures of TransTurkylvanians.  Again, this picture below is from The Toy Soldier Company.Historical ReadingSo, along with the gaming acquisitions and orders, there has also been some new reading, and some review of old favorites.  The old stuff first.  So, I really enjoy Martin Gilbert, and I enjoy his book on the First World War.  As far as old stand-bys are concerned, Guns of August (Barbara Tuchman) is always worth a re-read as well.As a new acquisition for me, although not a new book, is Marne, 1914 by Holger Herwig.  Near the top of my history book stack... And, also new to me, is Retreat and Rearguard by Jerry Murland.  The second is about the British Army and the BEF in particular, from Mons to the Marne (opening stages)."},

{"title": "War of the Roses Army - project planning and analysis", "date": "Saturday, December 21, 2013", "text": "So, if one were going to build a 28mm army for wargaming the War of the Roses, a couple of things should be done to begin the project.  First is to decide on the scope (size, scale, etc) of the project.  Second, is to decide on a side, or army nationality.  Third is to decide on the size and composition of the miniatures army.  Fourth, is to decide on the typical figure type/sculpt type.  Fifth is to choose miniatures, order them, and begin the prep/paint/finish process.Step one has been done - this will be a 28mm project, and I would like to aim for enough miniatures for a medium to large army good for a single player in a several hour wargame.Step two is MOSTLY done - I have been looking at both the Lancaster and also some of the Yorkist Pretender armies.  The reason for this is because Chris, my intended opponent, is looking strongly at a Yorkist Army.Step three is a tricky one.  More on that later.Step four is down to two choices, I believe.  The first choice is to use the Old Glory War of the Roses range.  These are good figures, and I have had great luck with the Old Glory figures in the past.Old Glory War of the Roses Longbowmen - from the Old Glory UK websiteThe second choice would be using as many as possible the Perry figures for the War of the Roses.  These would be plastic, and I have always loved the Perry brother's sculpts and look of their toy soldiers. An older range of Perry War of the Roses figures exist - the figures from Wargames Foundry (or The Foundry).  These, while quite excellent, are not as animated as the new figures from the brothers, but they would mix well.Perry plastic set that allows the building of Billmen and Bows.  From the Perry website.Step five is in progress - in fact, trying to decide which is what led me to write this article.Okay, so back to the unfinished step - Step Three.  I want to, if I stick with Lancaster, model the army of Somerset from the Battle of Towton (March 29, 1461).  This is a pretty standard late medieval army, both in command structure (three battles, each under the command of a separate Noble) and in composition (predominantly foot, with some heavy infantry knights and men-at-arms, as well as mixed ranks of billmen and longbowmen).  For reference, there are several well known books on the subject, as well as a great website on the Battlefield. Some of the books, of use for wargamers, are Boardman's book on The Battle of Towton, the Osprey Campaign guide to Towton, and more recently, the title Fatal Colors: Towton 1461 - England's most Brutal Battle, by George Goodwin.Map from the Towton Battlefield website (link above)From a wargaming perspective, there are some fantastic pictures at the Grimsby Wargaming Society (gallery 1 and gallery 2).  There is also a great compilation of War of the Roses battle descriptions (Albans, Towton, Wakefield and Barnet), using DBM, from Wargames Illustrated, the collection of articles exists as a PDF file here.  The details on the battle of Towton were by (as they all were) Eric J. Cruttendon.  Towton appeared in issue 137.  Using that article as a reference, the three battles of the Lancaster army are composed of these DBM elements -Somerset's BattleElementNumberDescriptionKn(S)1Duke of Somerset C-in-CKn(S)2Royal Bodyguard Men-at-armsBd(O)8Retinue BillmenBw(S)16Retinue BowmenBd(I)4Shire Levy BillmenBw(O)18Shire Levy BowmenBd(I)6Northern Border FootSp(I)12Northern Border FootBg(O)6King's BaggageNorthumberland's BattleElementNumberDescriptionKn(O)1Duke of NorthumberlandKn(I)3Men-at-ArmsCv(O)2CurroursLH(O)2Northern Border StavesBd(O)4Retinue BillmenBw(S)8Retinue BowmenBd(I)4Shire Levy BillmenBw(O)18Shire Levy BowmenExeter's BattleElementNumberDescriptionKn(O)1Duke of ExeterKn(I)2Men-at-ArmsCv(O)1CurroursBd(O)4Retinue BillmenBw(S)8Retinue BowmenBd(O)4Shire Levy BillmenBw(O)16Shire Levy BowmenThese descriptions are all well and good, and serve (as a wargaming reference) as an excellent guide to the composition and ratio of the three battles involved on the Lancaster (Royal, Red Rose) side during the battle of Towton.  However, I am currently thinking of two other sets of possible rules to represent the battle.The first set of rules would be Warhammer Ancient Battles 2 (sadly, out of print as Warhammer Historicals was, for some reason not to be gone into here, shut down), following the War of the Roses army list from the fan supported publication Armies of Antiquity 2.  For this set of rules, for the infantry units, I would go with 12 figure Retinue units (with 1 unit of 12 billmen, organized with two units of 12 each bowmen, giving a total of 36 figures for a bill/bow block), and maybe 6-8 figures for the mounted units.The second would be using a fan supported modification of the Dux Bellorum rules, modified for War of the Roses battles.  That modification can be found here - at the Shire and Everything After gaming blog.  As a mounting/organization size, I would use two stands of 60mm x 40mm bases for a unit in this set of rules.  For foot, that would be 12 figures, and for mounted that would be 6 figures.The nice thing about the 60mm x 40mm mounting is that it works for either ruleset, as well as a bunch of other rulesets that could be used - the WRG Renaissance rules could be used, as well as Impetus, Armati, HOTT, or even the Neil Thomas rules for Ancient and Medieval games (as well as his more general Introduction to Wargaming rules).So, looking at the DBM lists above from Cruttenden's article, we can surmise the following, choosing to analyze the basic ratios, and looking at blocks of bow/bill troops that were 33% bill.Somerset had two bow/bill blocks of Retinue soldiers, the other battles had only one each.All three battles had maybe 2 blocks of Shire/Levy (Militia) bow/bill blocks, with additional bodies of archers.All three had bodyguard elements (knights) for the C-in-CSome (scant) other knights (maybe 1 unit) were in each, as well as a few other lighter units (Northern spear and sword units, currours, staves).In Warhammer, doing a Retinue bow/bill block as I described (12 billmen, 24 bowmen) would cost the following:12 Billmen - @12 points each, with +1 for heavy armour, so a total of 156 points2x12 Bowmen - @13 points each (as per the errata), so a total of 312 pointsGiving each body a leader, musician, and standard bearer gives each a cost of +15 pointsTotal, for all three bodies of troops making up the bow/bill block would be 513 points.On the other hand, using the Dux Bellorum rules variant, a Retinue bow/bill block (again, with 1/3 of the troops being the bill unit, and two associated bow units), has the followingRetinue Bill - 12 billmen (two stands of six each) 3 army pointsRetinue Bow - 2 units of 12 bowmen each (two stands of six each unit) 2x 3 army points eachEach such bow/bill block would be 9 army points.To build two such blocks (the number of figures are the same, and I would even do the basing the same, either way), requires the following:Total (two blocks): 24x billmen, and 48x bowmen.Using the Perry Plastics, you would need two boxes, and then you would have a couple of figures left over (for command, no doubt).  Going with the pricing from The War Store this would come to a total of $64 (plus shipping, if any).Using Old Glory 25s, you would need 1 bag of Billmen, and 2 bags of Bowmen.  Assuming an Old Glory Army membership (40% discount), and ordering 1 bag of WOR-08 (Billmen in Livery Coats) and 2 bags of WOR-09 (Longbowmen in Livery Coats), the price would come out to 3x$21 = $63 (plus shipping, if any).So, the price is about the same either way.  Now I have to decide...."},
{"title": "Secret Santa - wonderful gifts!!", "date": "Friday, December 13, 2013", "text": "Each year, we participate in the Secret Santa list at Boardgamegeek, which is a great way to exchange board games with the community.It works like most Secret Santa lists - you submit your name, and there is a randomizer that spreads them all around - so you get another name in return.  Then you purchase some gifts ($50 minimum is suggested for this one), and send them to your target.  The person who got your name does the same in return.By looking at people's wishlist on BGG, you get to see what they want, and it encourages people to keep their wish list up to date.This year, my Secret Santa really did a great job.  I got three really fantastic, and different, gifts. Image from Z-Man Games website.First, I got the board game Troyes.  From the publisher (Z-Man Games), the following blurb appears:Built by the Romans during the first century in Belgian Gaul, Tournay experienced most of its growth along the Scheldt river.Unfortunately, the river also contributed to its troubles, because in 881, the Normans traversed its watery path, and thereby easily captured the city. That act of aggression stunted Tournay’s prosperity. This game invites you to participate in the reconstruction of the city, in order to establish a glorious era that will last for more than seven centuries. Help your district flourish by cleverly coordinating the work of the city’s three domains: military, religious, and civil. Certainly the prestige of your buildings will brighten the entire city! On the Boardgamegeek website, a different blurb appears, that is more about the actual game play.  I haven't played yet, but it involves rolling dice to generate possible actions where you place markers to control areas/actions, and improve your situation that way.In Troyes, recreate four centuries of history of this famous city of the Champagne region of France.  Each player manages their segment of the population (represented by a horde of dice) and their hand of cards, which represent the three primary domains of the city:  religious, military, and civil.  Players can also offer cash to their opponents' populace in order to get a little moonlighting out of them—anything for more fame!Make your underlings: work on the cathedral combat misfortune bustle about the city and other such tasks that are below your family's statureI am really excited about this one - it looks like it has tons of theme, and lots of medieval history and medieval inspired (and actual) art in the game.  Just from looking through the cards, I am sure Anita and I will love this one.The next game in the gift package is Unexploded Cow - the Deluxe edition from Cheapass Games.  This game, from the fertile mind of James Earnest, involves using Cows with mad cow disease to wander across fields of unexploded ordnance in France, trying (or not) to blow it (and the cow) up.  Wonderful theme for a game, I can't wait to play this one with friends over Christmas travels!!Here is an image from the Paizo blog, although I suspect it might be a Cheapass Games image...Nice full color components, including money chits, cards, box, and even a dice.  Color rules folio?  Cheapass games has come a long way from their beginnings (with everything printed on cheap white paper, and stuffed in a plain white envelope, with dice and money, etc coming from your own collection).Here is a video of James, and friends, explaining the game.  Very nicely done.And finally the third game that came in the package is not a game at all, but the latest \"big\" expansion for Carcassonne.  This one is called (in English) \"The Count, the King and the Robber\".  It wasn't availabe in English for a number of years, although the component expansions (it includes several smaller add ons that were published, separately in other places, previously) were part of some of the Big Box releases.  It comes with River II, the Count of Carcassonne, the King, and the Cult.image from the publisher - Z-Man Games The last one (the Cult) was the one I was most keen on getting, as well as another copy of River II (we like using a big sprawling river to play our games, gives everyone lots of room to spread out, so another dozen or so of river tiles and branches are very welcome.  Curiously, rather than being published in English by Rio Grande Games, this one was published by Z-Man games.  Strange.  But, Rio Grande had given this material out in small expansions, and part of Big Box 2 previously, so maybe not so strange.So, some wonderful new stuff to try and play, over our Christmas holidays."},
{"title": "Wargames structures - Initiative", "date": "Tuesday, November 26, 2013", "text": "So, one of the things that is germaine to just about every wargame is the way it handles the passage of time.  This occurs on a couple of different levels, depending on the wargame.  First, there is the passage of time for the simulated inhabitants in the wargame - how much do they get to do during the passage of simulated time?  But, more importantly, is the passage of time (real world) for the game it self.  By that, I mean to ask, how are the actions that the players are taking - moving the pieces, engaging in simulated combat, and so forth?  This is usually divided up into some mechanism where either both sides (or all sides) do their actions more or less simultaneously, or they take turns doing their actions.  In both cases, regulating who goes when is done by a number of different mechanisms that we can look at, and call Initiative.First, the treatment of a wargame as a classic two player game of conflict, where the players take turns, and during a player's turn does all the allowable actions, is often referred to as \"you go, I go\" type initiative.  This is the way it is done in many board based wargames, and has a long history going back to the abstract wargames of antiquity (such as Chess, Chatauranga, and Hnefetafl).  I have heard it commented that this is a natural way to view elements in a battle, even if it is implemented a little artificially in a game.  The idea, within a battle, is that there are a series of actions that then get reacted to, forming a sort of rhythm.Determine who gets their turn involves initiative.  The simplest manner is to determine the order (which is player A going first, and which is player B going second) during the first turn (which may be by a dice toss, or agreement, or set by a scenario) and then following that throughout the game. We can call this a \"regular, alternating initiative\".  The turn sequence (with two sides in the scenario, Red and Blue, taking turns in the sub-turn role of Player A and Player B) would look like thisRegular Alternating Initiative Turn 1 Player A - Red Player B - BlueTurn 2 Player A - Red Player B - BlueTurn 3 Player A - Red Player B - Blue A variant would be to, at the beginning of each turn (which consists of two sub-turns - one for each player), randomize (dice or cards) to see which is player A for that turn, and which player B. We can call this a \"random, alternating initiative\".  A feature of this is that there is a chance that the same side does not go first every time.  However, one of the side effects of this is that it is possible for a side to get to go twice in a row (in fact, it is guaranteed that this will happen, if the order does change).  See this example:Random Alternating InitiativeTurn 1 - dice toss, Red wins Player A - Red Player B - BlueTurn 2 - dice toss, Blue wins Player A - Blue Player B - RedTurn 3 - dice toss, Blue wins Player A - Blue Player B - Red Now, for the \"feature\" of this method, you can see that between the end of Turn 1, and the beginning of Turn 2, the Blue side goes twice in a row.  In a game with a large number of turns, the rules of probability would tend to balance out this effect, however in a game with only a short number of turns (say, 3,4,5 or 6 turns) it might provide a very large benefit to one side or another, depending on how the randomizing turns out.Each turn in a \"you go, I go\" type game itself typically has several phases, that allow for the ordering of the activities to get done.  These might include - issuing orders, movement, shooting, melee combat, morale tests, artillery - and so forth, depending on the type of combat that is being simulated.  A very common variant of the \"you go, I go\" type game is one where those phases get mixed up.  The turn (and phases) of a game with \"regular phases\" might look like this.Regular Phase Turn StructureTurn Player A  1. Shooting  2. Movement  3. Combat  4. Morale Tests Player B  1. Shooting  2. Movement  3. Combat  4. Morale TestsWhen some of the phases during a Player Turn actually belong to the side that is taking the role of the Non-Phase Player, we see an intermixed phase structure.  A good name for this sort of turn ordering is Intermixed Phase Turn Structure. Intermixed Phase Turn StructureTurn Player A 1. Player A moves units 2. Player B shoots 3. Combat 4. Morale TestsPlayer B 1. Player B moves units 2. Player A shoots 3. Combat 4.  Morale TestsTypically the point of having a Intermixed Phase structure is to introduce some elements that allow for each side to react to some of the actions of the other side.  In the above example, what is being replicated is the reaction of units to shoot at the enemy as they see them getting closer.  Depending on the simulation intent of the rules writer, this sort of structure will help them bring out what they think is important for the aspects of combat that their rules represent. One of the most common ways that this is done (perhaps inadvertently) is that during Combat, most wargames allow both sides to score casualties - so that both sides are operating more or less simultaneously during a combat phase).An alternative to \"You go, I go\" is something that we can name \"We go\" - this means that there is a turn, divided up into Phases, but during each phase there is a structure for determining who goes first.  This can be either Regular within the turn (meaning that the same side goes first for each Phase), Regular across turns (meanign that the same side goes first each Phase, and this is the same every turn), or some combination.  As the two players are alternating within a phase, but that the phases are being executed more or less concurrently, this can be named Alternating Order, Phase Concurrent Initiative (either regular or random, intermixed or not).  A turn structure here might look something like this:Alternating Order, Phase Concurrent InitiativeTurnPhase 1 - Movement Player A moves Player B movesPhase 2 - Shooting Player A shoots Player B shootsPhase 3 - Combat All contacting units combatPhase 4 - Morale All units requiring tests take themAn alternative to this scheme is to have regular Phases, but to have randomized activity order within the Phase - perhaps by dice or unit quality or by the turn of a card.  A common version of this are rulesets based on the structure of The Sword and the Flame - there is a Movement Phase, a Shooting Phase, a Combat Phase, and a Morale Phase.  But within the Movement Phase, cards are used to determine which units move before other units.  The same is done during the Shooting Phase. Combat (hand-to-hand) and Morale are done in preset orders (either by the order in which they arose during the movement phase, in the case of Combat, or all simultaneously in the case of Morale).  Such a turn scheme might be accurately labeled Randomized Order, Phase Concurrent Initiative.Randomized Order, Phase Concurrent IniatiativeTurnPhase 1 - Movement All eligible units may move, randomized order based on flipping cards Phase 2 - Shooting All eligible units may shoot, randomized order based on flipping cards Phase 3 - Combat All contacting units resolve hand-to-hand combat in the order in which they contacted during Movement. Phase 4 - Morale All units test morale simultaneouslyThe most common alternative to the Alternating Order, Phase Concurrent Iniative scheme (which is really quite popular in a lot of rulesets, especially those representing time periods where the interplay of space and time are important, such as when movement and shooting combine to have a big effect on the combat) is to have the Phases actually structured so that they are as close to Concurrent themselves as possible.  This would be a Simultaneous Order, Phase Concurrent Initiative.  What this structure seeks  to do is to remove any advantage for going first.  It is not perfect, especially in the area of movement, without the use of some blind method for plotting movement ahead of time (such as writing turn by turn movement orders, and having them interpreted by a referee.  Many players, especially modern players, find this unsatisfying, because they want control over where their units move. A typically scheme employed here is to use a \"test\" - usually a dice test - to see how the individual troops will react to situations that arise out of the simultaneous activities of the players.  This replicates the effects of command and reaction by the troops, at a level of command lower than what the player is exerting. For instance, a player may tell a unit (a battalion? perhaps) to move ahead.  In this situation the player may be taking on the role of a Brigadier or Division Commander.  But as the battalion moves ahead, it finds itself the target of a charge.  The Battalion commander in real life would rely on personal initiative and training in order to decide what to do next.  This might be to fire on the chargers, form square, withdraw, adopt skirmish formation, or whatever.  The rules would try to anticipate these types of situations, and enable a dice test for a unit to try in order to see if they can do these things.  This structure is often included in all of the different initiative types presented here, but it is especially important in the simultaneous phase execution type game.A Simultaneous Order, Phase Concurrent Initiative turn example might look something like this:  (Note, to illustrate the dice test mechanism, I have separated out Charging from normal Movement)Simultaneous Order, Phase Concurrent Initiative  TurnPhase 1 - Charges Both players declare charges simultaneous Both players move charging units Units targeted by charge may roll reaction to counterchargePhase 2 - Movement Both players move units that did not charge, and were not contactedPhase 3 - Shooting Units that did not move or charge may shoot (even if contacted)Phase 4 - Fighting All units in contact resolve hand-to-hand combatPhase 5 - Morale All units requiring test for fail or recoveryAnother theme popular in rule sets is to have the phases occur, in order, for a part of a side (either an individual unit, or perhaps a group of units such as a battle group or a brigade), but to have those parts be either randomized or alternate.  Once such a \"part\" is activated (whether a unit or a group of units), it will do it's allowable phases - movement, shooting, combat, etc.  Then the next \"part is activated.  The ordering here is done either on a regular bases, where alternation between sides is common, or it is randomized perhaps by dice toss to determine regular order at the beginning of a turn (such as in Shako II, where you roll an \"initiative dice\" to determine the order of divisions at the beginning of each turn), or by the flip of a card (such as in rulesets where you have a card for every brigade in the game, and those are shuffled at the beginning of a turn, and then revealed to see which brigade does its actions first).  These two different initiative schemes can be called, respectively, \"Regular Order, Phase by Command\" and \"Randomized Order, Phase by Command\" - where the 'parts' are referred to as the \"Command\".  Here is an example of the second scheme.Randomized Order, Phase by CommandTurnReveal a Card, identifying a BrigadeBrigade performs all of the following Phases Phase 1 - Movement Phase 2 - Shooting Phase 3 - Combat Phase 4 - MoraleNext CardThis scheme can vary by allowing for the intermix of other phases, for enemy units encountered on the table top (such as reaction moves, reaction fires, counter charges, etc).When there is a basic \"You Go, I Go\" structure (even with their variations, these are the simplest to implement, and the simplest to explain in written rules), sometimes the unnatural regular alternation of moves is controlled by a dice roll (or some other method, such as commander's value or army effectiveness, etc).  In this case, the dice roll will determine how many actions may be done in one or several of the phases of the turn.  For instance, in the DBA family of games, a dice for command points will determine how many \"commands\" (consisting of one base, or a group of connected bases) may move during a turn.  They move, and then shoot, and then all in contact fight, and the turn is over.  Not every unit gets to move (or shoot) each turn.  This scheme is applied, in different rule sets, to almost all of the various initiative schemes presented here so far.The Piquet family of miniatures rules mixes up this ordering one more way.  In those rules, it is common to have a Turn consist of a number of different Actions (regulated by some counter, called Initiative Points among other things).  Once those actions are all used up, the turn is over.  In Piquet, there is a mechanism to see how many of those actions a Player gets to use at one time, based on opposed dice rolls by the different sides.  The higher of the dice tossed gets to go, and he gets the difference in initiative points.  How the player gets to expend those initiative points is based on a randomized presentation of options.  In Piquet, it is a card, showing a single type of action (move, shoot, reload, etc).  The player may expend as many actions as desired on that single type of action, and then flips the next card to see what else may be done.  Eventually the player runs out of points, and the next opposed dice roll is made.Another variation to the many different schemes related to \"You Go, I Go\" is one where a player may decide to \"steal the initiative\" from his opponent.  In this case, one of the two players is determined to have the Initiative - in other words, it is that player's turn to execute phases for his forces.  The other player (through a number of different possible mechanics - expending command points, rolling dice, flipping cards) may try to \"steal the initiative\" - meaning that they get to execute phases for their own forces instead, trumping the actions of the first player.  In order to be fare, such a scheme is often structured around some penalty for the player attempting to steal the initiative.   In addition to the \"You Go, I Go\" type turns, this variation is also common in the Phase by Command type schemes - where it becomes the turn for one Command (brigade, squadron, wing, etc) to do their actions - another player may decide instead to attempt to steal that order for one of their own Commands.  If successful, then the turn changes to the new Command, but if not successful, then there is often a penalty for that other Command (such as, it may not go this turn, or the player loses one of a finite group of command points, or something similar).A recent, but popular variation of \"You Go, I Go\" is one where within the turn structure of a Side, that side gets to make leadership tests to see which of his units (or Commands) gets to act, and how much they get to act.  Penalties arise from failing the leadership tests required to get units to act (for instance, after so many failures, the turn may pass to the other player, or again, finite command points may need to be expended in order to 'try again').  This scheme is in the recently family of miniature rules sets coming from the Rick Priestley school of design, starting with Warmaster, and also seen in the Warlord Games family of titles (Black Powder, Hail Caesar, etc) and the Blitzkrieg Command series of rules.  It works very well, and puts the emphasis of command decision on the player, but with the uncertainty of a dice roll involved in order to carry out the desired orders.  Very effective design."},
{"title": "OGRE scenario - Withdraw from Greywater", "date": "Sunday, November 24, 2013", "text": "Working on some linked scenarios for a mini-campaign (\"Withdraw from Greywater\").  These will revolve around the GEV map.  Before I talk about the scenarios, take a look at this - the manilla paper map that was in the first of the Metagaming releases of GEV (this was the version I owned).Very different feel (even thought it is technically the same map) from the later full color offering that Steve Jackson Games put out.The first scenario in \"Decision at Greywater\" represents a heavy Combine formation moving from east to west, trying to get off the map, while wreaking havoc on the built up areas in their path. The story is this - a very heavy Combine column has made a raid on a Paneuropean industrial area, smashing the Greywater Cybertank maintenance yard,  On returning back to Combine lines, some resistance is encountered, but it is not very strong (at first).  Arriving reinforcements make the fight more interesting, very quickly.  Providing a high guard (and orbital overwatch) of the Combine column is a trio of recently launched Laser Satellites.  But with a life expectancy that is measured in hours and minutes, these are not expected to have a long lasting effect on the war, or even on this one encounter.Winchell Chung image of a Light Tank and Heavy Tank (from http://www.goingfaster.com/ogre/originalartwork.html)Combine Forces: The Combine commander starts with a company of heavy tanks (10 HVY), supported by a pair of  superheavy tanks (2 SHVY), enter the eastern map edge.  These enter on turn one, and can enter anywhere on or with 2 hexes (north or south) of either of the two roads that enter the eastern edge of the maps (hexes numbered 1403 and 2514).  Combine Goal:The goal is for as many of those 12 units to escape off the western edge of the map.  Victory points are also scored for reducing any Target hexes to rubble.Paneuropean Forces:The Paneuropean commander stars with two platoons of ground effect vehicle tanks (6 GEV), supported by two companies of Infantry (18sp).  At least one strength point of infantry must begin in each of the following hexes (0412, 0413, 0513, 1411, 1412, 1018, 1118, 1119).Paneuropean Goal:The goal is to stop as many Combine HVY and SHVY tanks before they can either exit the map, or rubble Target hexes.Turning Town hexes into Rubble.Map Rules:For this scenario, the long bridge at hex 2214 is not destroyable.There is an additional long bridge that stretches from hex 2518 through 2418 and into 2318.  It is also not destroyable.The eight town hexes that the Paneuropean Infantry start in are all \"Target\" hexes for Combine victory points. Possible HVY Tank, by Wootten (http://concepttanks.blogspot.com/)Special Rules:1. Laser Satellites - The Combine player has access to three Orbital Laser Satellites (recently launched, and not expected to last long).  At the beginning of each turn, the Combine player may target any hex on the map with each surviving Satellite.  He makes a note of the hex number(s) he is targeting (each satellite targets a separate hex), and then during combat he will make a STR 6 attack against a unit in that hex, and then spill over attacks to any other units in the hex.For each HVY or SHVY unit that is destroyed, the Paneuropean player rolls 2d6.  If the result is 11+, then one of the Satellites is knocked out.2. Reinforcements - The Paneuropean Player receives reinforcements at the end of every Odd numbered turn (beginning with the first).  Roll on the following chart (first to see what the reinforcing unit is, and second to determine starting location).

{"title": "OGRE Designer's Edition - Big", "date": "Wednesday, November 20, 2013", "text": "So, the Designer Edition of OGRE - from being backed on Kickstarter by me and hundreds of other gamers, to a tune of almost $1million - has finally shipped and reached the new owners. I received mine last week, just before going to a conference.  I finished opening it this week (and fawning on it, and constructing the hundreds of 3d models that come in it).  Lovely, and huge.  Over 30 years old, and still a wonderful game.This is a big fricking deal (to come close to misquoting Vice President Biden).  The box and the contents therein weigh 28 pounds.  There is, as one of the main components, the large two piece OGRE map, reminiscent of the full color treatment of the original game, as was done by SJG once they got the title on Steve's departure from Metagaming.  Here is an image of the second Metagaming printing (an image of what the first printing appears lower down in this article), which was black and white (the second printing is the edition I originally owned), and that is followed by the first SJG (color) version.B and W Version from Metagaming's Second EditionColor Version from SJG's First (black plastic box) versionThe game then, as it is now, is the tale of an OGRE - a large unmanned cybernetic tank, reminiscent of Keith Laumer's BOLO creations - that is driving towards a CP (Command Post), and the defenders must try to stop it.  The hitch?  The OGRE is indestructible - it can only have various components shot off of it (like guns, missile launchers, and tread units).  A very, very compelling game, and always well balanced almost every time.  Ignore those who whimper about the four howitzer defense - it is manageable by an experienced cyber-commander.  If you haven't heard of the four howitzer defense, you have to read this article - it isn't a sure fire way to keep that monstrosity from overrunning the CP, but it does help.Okay, so what about that first printing of the black and white map?  The very first printing of OGRE, back in 1977 (same year Star Wars came out, same year Traveller came out - a pretty good year for Science Fiction, I think) had a rather plain (even plainer than the one above with the black and white craters) map, and simple counters.  The counters were printed on a single piece of card stock, and you had to cut them out.  Glorious (I loved it then, and I still love it).  The original looked like this (except this version has actual die cut counters) -Reprinting of the Original Edition - out in 2013Yep, the original map had solid black hexes for craters, and the ridge lines looked like thick black lines.  But it STILL worked.As mentioned, the Designer Edition comes with a version that looks a lot like the color version above, but it is extremely large.  Extremely.  The original map was 8.5\" by 14\" (or close to that).  The new map is  The sister game to OGRE (which is also well represented in the new Designer Edition) was GEV (which stands for Ground Effect Vehicle - the name given to the fast and nimble hover tanks of the OGRE universe - somewhat reminiscent of the blower tanks of Hammer's Slammers universe of David Drake, but maybe not as tough).  GEV had a much more interesting full color map (with forests, roads, cities, swamp, rivers, streams, train tracks, and even ocean), and had scenarios for armies from the OGRE universe (2085AD) fighting with each other, sometimes without an OGRE making an appearance.  Also included in the Designer Edition are terrain overlays, so that you can modify any of the maps included - by adding or extending or reducing elements such as cities, forests, water, roads, bridges or railroads.  Almost anything is possible with what comes in the kit.  And if that ain't enough, there are planned expansion terrain elements coming out (which I plan to get).The map for GEV is included in the new designer's edition.  Along with a handful of other expansion maps to go along with it.Color version of GEV map, from SJG - the original Metagaming version was white, with colored ink used for terrain.In my own personal gaming history, I owned GEV before I owned OGRE.  And I loved it.  The four basic scenarios that came in the game were awesome, and I still love them (breakthrough, ceasefire collapse, raid, and so forth).  What an absolute great game.  And the map (above) and a handful of other GEV compatible maps (geomorphic, so they can be combined with any edge of the above map, to create larger battlefields) are in the designer edition.  Along with plenty (PLENTY) of units from GEV.So what about units?  The Designer Edition comes with many, many units.  More OGREs than I have ever thought of using in a scenario.  These included 3d model versions of everything from MK IIs up through MK VIs - and variants along the way.  The variants are the MkIIIb, the Fencer (and Fencer-B), the Doppelsoldner, the Vulcan, and others.  In both Paneuropean and Combine version.  And the Paneuropean MKIIIs and MKVs have their alternate names on the bottom (Legionnaire and Huscarl).  Also, OGREs in the colors of other factions - generic grey/white, green (Kickstarter only?), etc.Units from the Designer Edition - MkV OGRE on the left, MkIII OGRE on the right, and ground units in between.  3d model of a Laser Tower (to protect against cruise missiles, natch)The smaller units (conventional units) are available for both main armies (North American Combine, and Paneuropean Alliance), as well as other armies.  Including the Black Rose Mercenaries, and others.  Lots of troops.In fact, with all the maps provided, and all the figures provided, you could play several games simultaneously.  Provided you have room for the massive maps.  Makes it a great game for club night, or a convention - as one game can keep 6 or 8 gamers going for a while, easily.  And the battles (if kept reasonable) fight quick enough that round robin swapping of opponents could make for a very satisfying evening. To make all this possible, the Designer Edition came with a handy-dandy bag, to make carrying this behemoth (OGRE) of a game, possible.Picture of the game, in the bag, from BGG, with the owner's punched out countersheets up top.  This game is almost 7\" thick, and over two feet across...I plan to take this baby to a game night in Columbus sometime soon, at the new location of Moxie Games.  I will report back on progress, with pictures, when I do."},
{"title": "Dice games - push your luck", "date": "Monday, November 18, 2013", "text": "So, the idea with a push your luck style dice game is that with every dice roll (that you survive) you potentially reap some rewards.  As your pile of rewards gets bigger and bigger, the possibility of NOT surviving a dice roll (and losing all those goodies) becomes the intangible decision point for the player to decide about every turn.This is true in lots of dice games - Zombie Dice from Steve Jackson Games is one of the more popular.  You get to keep brains (which score points), up until you roll three shotgun blasts - they you are out for the turn and lose all those juicy brains.  If, however, you choose to stop rolling - you get to keep whatever brains you have scored so far that turn - but you give up the possibility of rolling yet further brains (and further shotgun blasts).Now, in comparison, take a look at Rollin' Bones - the Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides dice game.  This is an attractive enough game.  Comes in a cloth bag, with a nice color rules folio, and with bones shaped like finger bones.From Board Game Geek -http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/1632171 The \"bones\" have four sides - 1 skull, 1 bone, 1 shovel, 1 sword.  On your turn you roll any \"bones\" you have accumulated (but not yet buried), including one more from the pool (the bone yard).If you get 1 skull symbol, your turn is over, and you lose any \"bones\" you have accumulated, as well as those you picked this turn.  That is a 25%  chance - per dice.  So the more dice you roll, the more chance you have of losing EVERYTHING.  Why would you ever choose to roll more dice than the minimum?I haven't figured this game out yet - the components are neat enough that a simple rules fix might make it a better game.  Still working on it...."},
{"title": "Furstenberg Units - Pictures of Seebataillon", "date": "Thursday, November 7, 2013", "text": "Here we have pictures of Furstenberg Seebataillon (naval infantry).  This is the 3rd Company.  The distinction from regular infantry is the light color of the sky blue Seebataillon trousers, and also the fouled anchor collar tab pins (not seen on the miniatures).  A proud distinction that the units themselves make is the use of bright yellow bedrolls, in distinction from the red bedrolls that the regular infantry use.Seebataillon are expected to take the brunt of the fighting in either landing actions, or in actions that are fought in defense of Naval coastal assets (bases, weapon stations, etc).  Because of that, the companies are formed up like battalions, with four stands of three figures each.Here we see the back-of-stand distinctions for the Seebataillon Companies (battalions).  They are sky blue, with colored tabs of red, trimmed in yellow.  This is the third Company, so it has three such red/yellow tabs on the sky blue background.Here are some pictures of a unit of regular Line Infantry in Furstenberg service.  The medium blue trousers, with dark blue tunic, topped with a dark blue kepi.  One of the distinctions of the regular infantry are the red bedrolls, seen at the top of their campaign packs.  Once a unit is in the field for some time, it is not as typical to see so many of the red bedrolls, but one a battalion first leaves for the field, it is almost uniform throughout.The next picture is of a different unit, but is included here to illustrate something.  The unit is actually a Mountaineer unit, as you can see by the Mountaineer hat that the units are famous for.  The bedrolls are a mix of different drab colors, notable for not being red throughout.The interesting thing to notice is the color bands at the base of the unit - the back of each base is colored a different series to match the unit itself.  All of the Furstenberg infantry units are so marked.  This marking (dark green with a brown central band) belongs to the Mountaineers - which are all dark green, with a colored band of distinction.Here are a few pictures of two battalions of Furstenberger light infantry.  These are forest rangers, which have the name of Waldjaegers in the Margravate army.  The unit in the foreground (in skirmish formation) is 2nd Battalion, 48th Waldjaeger.  The battalion behind is from the 51st.Standard for the basing that I am doing, all companies (stands) are 40mm x 40mm square.Since these are light infantry, and not regular infantry, they have only two figures per base. The Waldjaeger uniform is dark green throughout, with a grey goose feather on the side of the dark green kepi."},

{"title": "Enlightened Imaginations - Army Building", "date": "Saturday, October 26, 2013", "text": "Having cleared my schedule and my painting table (updates coming soon of recently finished projects, which include Russian Civil War Tschankas, 19th century imaginations naval forces, and some shore fortifications), I am now returning to a project started three years ago, prior to finishing my PhD and starting life as a professor.I have begun the process of assembling and painting the Armies of the Principality of Bombastia, and the Duchy of Poppenheim.  These are to be based (loosely) on the armies of Peter the Great, and Charles XII. I am using the Wargames Factory \"War of the Spanish Succession\" figures for the infantry, which is the first part of the project.I have, from a purchase made under the original ownership of Wargames Factory, but delivered after the company changed hands, a dozen boxes of infantry, each capable of modeling 36 figures.  As I am planning on building 24 figure units, that will give me 8 full size units, and 2 half size units for each side.The two warring powers represent (in my fictional Imagi-Nations history) separate states, based on older medieval fiefdoms, that would eventually be absorbed into the more modern state of Furstenberg.  Because of the historical ties, and due to a restriction imposed on the Furstenberg states by the church, during the 17th century wars of religion that wracked Balkania (see the War of St. Helga's Baptismal, in the general history of Furstenberg, the armies of any of the Furstenberg powers were not permitted to employ grenadiers in field battles.  Because of this, there are no units in either army that bear the classification of Grenadier.However, Poppenheim could employed converged regiments of elite infantry (pulling companies from line battalions), and Bombastia would frequently converge the elite flank companies of the regular infantry battalions, as well as having formed standing regiments of elite infantry.  It is important to know that although these units may have appeared in the Furstenberg \"Grand Tally of Arms\" (the best surviving record of battalions and regiments under arms, during the 17ths and 18th century in the seven provinces of Furstenberg) as alternatively \"Heavy Infantry\" and \"Guard Infantry\" they were routinely referred to as Grenadiers by the officers - many of which had trained in the arms service of other nations.. Here are the first photos of the first battalion under construction, a Poppenheim unit.That picture shows four stands, each 60mm x 40mm and with six figures. The command stand features three musketeers and a drummer, standard bearer and an officer. A different angle, showing the figures face on.An image showing a ruler for reference, and a fine Balkanian tobacco pipe, used to assist in the painting process.Assembling the 21 musketeers took about 40 minutes.  And I wasn't rushed (ref: Balkanian smoking pipe).  The three officers took a little longer, maybe 20-30 minutes for all three.  In all, less time than it would have taken to clean metal figures."},
{"title": "Star Wars X-Wing - simple campaign rules", "date": "Friday, October 25, 2013", "text": "I have played this a few times now, and really like it.  The models are great, and the game system is a nice modification of the Wings of War (Wings of Glory) system.Picture of an X-Wing game in progress, from Boardgame Geek http://tinyurl.com/mel9bxn One of the things, especially given the great stories about the conflicts between different units of Imperial and Rebel units in the Expanded Universe (books, comics, games, etc), is the idea of an ongoing campaign within a sector of space.I have been thinking of how to do this, especially given a map, and some unit logistics, and access to different units (ships, fighters, etc), but it is still in the works.However, for some simple \"pilot focused\" games, where a player is rewarded for good performance with the same pilot, I offer up these rules.  This is based on the situation where either a Club or Game Store is the location for regular, weekly (or whenever), play.  With players able to play games with other players in the campaign.We're all in it together. 1. Once a player chooses a unit (ship, fighter, etc - including all upgrades), that player will play that unit until they either (1) are *killed* in a game, or (2) gain enough experience points to purchase a new confuration.2. Once a new player enters the campaign, they are allowed to purchase a fighter, with a pilot and upgrades, for a set amount of points (suggested - start with 15 or 20 pts for Imperial players, and maybe 25 points for Rebel players). See alternative below, for all players being in the same squadron.3. For each game that a player \"survives\" they receive 1 new point (\"increase points\").4. For each point of damage (regular or critical) that they inflict on an enemy ship, they receive 1 new point.5. For each enemy ship that they inflict the killing shot (this could be shared, by ships firing simultaneously), they receive 1 additional new increase point.6. Anytime a player wants to use their points (added to their starting value) they may replace their unit with a different unit.Trophy in the Ready Room.Option 1: \"Part of the Rebel Alliance\" All players are (either) Rebel or Imperial.  In any game, some of the players (or bystanders) will have to play units of the other side.  If campaign players are playing the \"bad guys\" then after the game is over (regardless of how they do), they will receive points \"on account\".  These points will be awarded to their total, after the next game that they play, as a regular player (piloting their regular ship).  The amount of points that they receive varies based on how well that they do.  If the \"bad guy\" pilot survives the encounter and their side wins, then they receive 1 point for every ship (or fighter) on the \"good guy\" side.  If the bad guys lose, then they receive half (round down) of this amount.Option 2: \"The Force is Strong in this One\" When a player finally dies, they get to come into the game with a new pilot at the starting level.  If that pilot survives their first battle, then they immediately receive Half of the increase points that their prior pilot had.  This represents the training that a pilot could have received from their (now dead) mentor.Note that a campaign referee should \"ok\" any games, in terms of scenario, balance of forces, etc.  In the case of players being on both sides (Imperial and Rebel) this is less important, but in the case where all the players are on one side, it will quickly get out of hand, if a Referee is not part of the solution.This system would work much better if there are multiple games each week (or each club get-together), with smaller faster encounters making for a better campaign."},
{"title": "Wargaming project update", "date": "Tuesday, October 15, 2013", "text": "So, things at Gaming with Chuck HQ have settled into the typical Autumn pattern - school, work, trips, looking ahead to holidays, etc.The weather is nice enough that I can use my painting area (which is in the garage) again, without suffering from the summer heat. We have had some very nice (and successful) game nights at our house lately, mostly board and card games.I have been working on a couple of wargaming projects, and have some progress to report.1. I have completed the painting on the vessels (for both navies) for my 1870s imagi-nations naval project.  I now have fleets for both the Margravate of Furstenberg, and the Confederated Cantons of Rumpwhistle.  Games coming soon.2. I have built some shore facilities to use with the new navies - some towns, and some fortification/gun batteries.  Yet to be painted.  Nice to have, but not needed for games.3. I have constructed the first 6 figures (plastic, multipart) for my 1700 imagi-nations project (Poppenheim vs. Bombastia).  These went together very easily, and I think I will stick wth the plastics.  I already have a bunch purchased (Wargames Factory - owned when the company was under the original leadership, but this left me with 332 infantry figures, enough for both armies). The 6 figures took seconds to put together.  The basic figure in the Wargames Factory box sets go together really easily - 2/3 of the figures only need a head attached.  The other figures are a little bit more complex (heads, and arms).  Looking forward to doing some whole (24 figure) units4. The 1870 infantry (repurposed ACW figures, now used for Furstenberg and Rumpwhistle) has been MOSTLY rebased and ready to go.  There is still a box of infantry left to work up, and some more cavalry, and guns.  This is pretty much ready to go for a small battle, which I hope to get played this autumn.  Still thinking about rules.5. Really thinking about dark ages stuff (vikings, danes, scotts, etc).  Have lots of lead, just deciding if I want to do this before or after the 1700 stuff.Pictures and ship details on the navies; posed pictures, maybe a game, for the 1870 stuff."},
{"title": "Western Music and Western Gaming", "date": "Friday, October 11, 2013", "text": "[NOTE: This is the 400th post at Gaming with Chuck.  Huzzah!]The mythological old west of the United States is a fantastic place, to tell stories, to set songs, and even to base gaming themes on.  First a couple of pieces of classic Western music.In the fantastic song Ghost Riders in the Sky a story is told about a herd of demonic cattle (red eyes, steel hooves, flaming brands) being chased forever by cursed cowboys.  It is reminiscent of tales like the Flying Dutchman, or the Wild Hunt.  The song was first recorded by none other than the fantastic singer, Burl Ives in February of 1949.  It was then recorded by Vaughn Monroe in March of 1949.  Monroe's version is fantastic, partially because of his incredible basso voice, but also the music is very well done.  In contrast, many other versions that feature (mostly) a single instrument - like Burl Ives', or Johnny Cash's versions - are pretty nice to hear as well.  There is a nice Youtube recording of the Burl Ives version.This song has been recorded so many times, by so many great artists, it is hard to know which to include.  However, in the (mostly terrible) movie Ghost Rider (based on the much better comic book character), Nicholas Cage gets a modern remake of the skull-and-hellfire cowboy.  The song got a remake as well, with a version by Spiderbait.  Dare I say it - the brief bit with Sam Elliott as the traditional horse riding version of Ghost Rider is 187x more classy than Nick Cage's motorcycle riding version.  But then again, Sam Elliott is a real cowboy.Famous cowboy singer Marty Robbins did a version as well.  But, if I'm going to include a western song by Marty Robbins, it HAS to be El Paso.  Nothing more to say on that one.  I think verses of it even were reprinted inside the rulebook \"Hey You in the Jail\" (great range war miniatures game by Peter Pig).American Cowboy (the website of the cowboy lifestyle) has a great list of the top 100 western songs.  Lots of great songs there.  But if I think of some of my favorite western movies, and some of the songs from them, I have to include the rendition of \"My Rifle, my Pony, and Me\" by Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson, from the fantastic John Wayne piece, \"Rio Bravo\" (1959).Okay, moving from what is a HUGE topic of music, to an equally large topic of gaming, I would like to start with a relatively recent (2002) offering - the card game Bang!.  This has been a great hit for Emiliano Sciarra, spinning of a bunch of expansions and variations.  There is even, now, a dice game.The game is about gun fighting in a classic Hollywood, or Spaghetti Western, style town.  There are different roles for the players - Sheriff, Deputy, Outlaw and Renegade - and classic actions (shooting, hiding, etc).  Here is the text from Board Game Geek, which is mostly from the original game's box back...\"The Outlaws hunt the Sheriff. The Sheriff hunts the Outlaws. The Renegade plots secretly, ready to take one side or the other. Bullets fly. Who among the gunmen is a Deputy, ready to sacrifice himself for the Sheriff? And who is a merciless Outlaw, willing to kill him? If you want to find out, just draw (your cards)!\" (From back of box)This card game recreates an old-fashioned spaghetti western shoot-out, with each player randomly receiving a Character card to determine special abilities, and a secret Role card to determine their goal.Four different Roles are available, each with a unique victory condition: Sheriff - Kill all Outlaws and the Renegade Deputy - Protect the Sheriff and kill any Outlaws Outlaw - Kill the Sheriff Renegade - Be the last person standingA player's Role is kept secret, except for the Sheriff. Character cards are placed face-up on table, and also track strength (hand limit) in addition to special ability.There are 22 different types of cards in the draw deck. Most common are the BANG! cards, which let you shoot at another player, assuming the target is within \"range\" of your current gun.  The target player can play a \"MISSED!\" card to dodge the shot.  Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5.The Gatling is a deadly exception where range doesn't matter - it can only be used once, but targets all other players at the table!Information on the cards is displayed using language-independent symbols, and 7 summary/reference cards are included.A great game.  Another western themed card game that has loads of period flavor is the fantastic Mystery Rummy spinoff Wyatt Earp, based on the original series design by Mike Fitzgerald.  The game also has Richard Borg listed as a designer, so perhaps he added the unique elements to this title. The game has the players in the role of Sheriff's attempting to bring in dangerous (and famous) criminals of the old west.  It involves collecting and playing sets of cards.  Lots of fun, and a ton of theme.Another card game, that is quite popular, but not one of my favorites, is Munchkin.  There is (yes, of course there is) an Old West themed version, called The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin! It, itself, even has expansions. On the boardgame front, there is a lot to choose from, including the classic man-to-man shooting boardgame from Avalon Hill, Gunslinger (1982). It is a great hex based man-to-man cowboy combat game, with a number of cool scenarios you can play out of the book, and is easy enough to create any situation you want, from novels, movies, or your own imagination.A nice modern re-doing of the man-to-man cowboy game (and there have been a number over the years) is the 2007 release of \"Cowboys: Way of the Gun\" from Worthington Games.  Other than different mechanics, one of the big differences is the reliance on square grid vs. hex grid for the map structure and movement, etc.Another nice theme for board games is Western Expansion.  Two that I can immediately think of, other than the many, many different railroad games set in the old west, are Oregon, and Settlers of America: Trails to Rails.  There are many, many titles in this category as well, but those two come to mind immediately.Oregon is all about building up buildings, mines, and other features to help construct a territory in the west. It is a lot of fun, pretty well balanced (typical Euro in that regard), and great art/theme. It is a settling game, and appropriately, it is based on Area Control and placing Tiles.  Great game, however.Settlers of America: Trails to Rails is a Settlers of Catan based game, with a fixed map of the United States during the Manifest Destiny period, and it is a great economic game about western expansion. And it features typically high quality components and quality control from Mayfair Games.There are also a lot of western themed RPGs that I could mention (Boot Hill, Deadlands, Western Hero), as well as some western themed Miniatures Rules (The Rules With No Name, Hey You in the Jail, Pony Wars).  After all of this, however, I am again faced with the thought that the Old West (in myth, if not in reality) is a fantastic theme for music, games, and movies.  And I didn't even mention too much about the movies..."},
{"title": "Game Day at our house, last weekend", "date": "Saturday, October 5, 2013", "text": "So, we had a number of folks come over our house last weekend, and play some games.  There were some new people we had met in Columbus - Jason and Kylie, as well as Bob and his college aged daughter Amber, and our daughter Heidi brought her high school friend, Sailor Ann, over to play.  It was a great mix, and we had a great time.Games played included big games of both 6 Nimmt (also called Category 5) and Bohnanza (using the supplemental cards, which I believe now come in the base game).  Both of those games were a big hit!  The Cows of 6 Nimmt were easily matched for excitement and funny comments by the Beans of Bohnanza.  As usual, with our German version of Bohnanza, without German speakers in the game, we made up our usual funny names for the bean (poopy bean, angry bean, etc).German version (that we own) of 6 Nimmt - \"6 Takes It\"Some of the many, exciting, cows - or Hornochsen, in 6 Nimmt!The Rio Grande (U.S.) version of Bohnanza - we actually own the Amigo German versionThe eleven types of Beans in the basic game, and first expansion, plus the Third Bean Field cardThese games had everyone in a great mood, and it was made even better by dinner - Anita served up some delicious home made chili and corn bread muffins, and we then followed up with Cake that was made by Amber.  She decorated the cake with the cover art from Ticket to Ride.  The TtR cover art was on the top of the cake, and the scoring track was around the side of the cake.  It was a quite good confetti cake.We then split up into two groups - one group played Ticket to Ride, and the other played Ticket to Ride Europe.  In addition to the basic game, there were some extra pieces used in the North America version - they used the wooden replacement train pieces that we own, as well as the Halloween Fright Train pieces from Days of Wonder.Finally, after the Ticket to Ride fest, the evening rounded out by the remaining five gamers (myself, Jason, Kylie, Amber, and Bob) playing a game of Power Grid.  We used the standard US board since not too many of us had played before, and it was a really good time. All-in-all a great social event, and a great boardgaming get together.  We'll do it again in about a month.I am currently attending SIEGE 2013, the videogaming conference in Atlanta.  This is a nice little conference, aimed at providing good information for members of both the video gaming community, as well as academics (students, college programs, technical schools, etc).  I am here with a colleague (a member of the computer science faculty from Columbus State University, like my self), and with a half dozen students.We are having a great time, but I wanted to comment on the number of boardgaming activities.First, there is, in the exposition hall, a person who has set up a booth with a large (250+) collection of board games as a library for people to play during the conference.Second, there have been some programming tracks that deal specifically with boardgaming and non-digital game design.  I attended one on design, which was pretty good, but the conversation of the panel was dominated by a bloviating primate one opinionated commentator who really didn't have much to add to the conversation, except redundant comments about the (in my opinion) poor designs from his game company and his own experiences.  However, on the whole, perhaps it is because I don't like the games his company publishes.  Okay, there is goodness for everyone, and I don't have to poo poo because it is not my particular brand.Third - I participated in an Academic Roundtable, which was for professors who teach gaming and game related topics (I teach classes in simulation, gaming, as well as supporting computer science topics).  The conversation turned to the use of non-digital game design in the class room to teach a number of different principals, as well as the use of serious gaming as an education tool.Fourth - I played some boardgames with my students last night, and will do so again tonight.  Last night we played 6 Nimmt!  and had a great time (by the third play, there was cursing and yelping going on - a good sign in 6 Nimmt).  Following up on that, we played Settlers of Catan.  The nice fellow who brought the boardgame library to the conference let us use his 10th anniversary version of the game, which I have to admit is visually amazing!The blog Deep in the Stacks has had some really good reviews of old Amber Zone articles.  Amber Zones were articles (first in the Journal of the Traveller's Aid Society, then elsewhere) that detailed the outline of an adventure.  They would describe the situation, the patron, the payoff, and the basic activities that the players would have to go through.  As well as, often, a series  of possible complications or outcomes. In short, it is an outline for a game scenario. for the GM to use to run a self contained adventure.What the author of Deep in the Stacks (one of my favorite blogs - combines gaming with orthodox Christian philosophy and other stuff, like a love of books) has added to his reviews is some additional information that might be relevant to the GM of today who is going to pick up the adventure and run it.  Like in the article reviewing the adventure \"Ticket to Swords\" by Robert Camino.  The blog author has crafted a very nice map of the setting for the adventure (which features the players serving as officers of a mercenary unit that gets hired to train some locals to defend against a rebel uprising). I can recommend two things - first, follow Deep in the Stacks, and second, never give up on the goodness of those old adventures."},
{"title": "Flying Aces of World War I", "date": "Thursday, September 12, 2013", "text": "When I was a youngster (9? 10?), I read Gene Gurney's fantastic book, \"Flying Aces of WW I\".  It established a life long fascination with those magnificent young men and their flying machines - the aerialists of the various military forces in the Great War.  I should point out that the book is just as old as I am - we were both first unleashed on an unsuspecting world, back in 1965.While on a trip, this past week, back to my old hometown (Newport News, Virginia), I met up with a few wargamers who used to belong to the grand old wargaming club of Newport News, ODMS.  Alas, ODMS exists no longer, but we got together anyway and played at World's Best Comics.  The game that we played? Wings of War.  John Snelling who hosted the game, is a member of the Friday Night wargaming group Wings of War Nouvelles du Nouveau Port (\"Wings of War Newport News\").Wings of War (now Wings of Glory, due to the game transferring from one publisher to another) is a fantastic game, and is the inspirational basis for the Star Wars: X Wing Miniatures game and the new Star Trek: Attack Wing game, both with some changes from the original.  The game has been very well supported, with multiple versions of the base game available.  It is playable out of the box with very nice, full color counters for each plane, and decks of cards for maneuver and shooting, and measuring sticks for combat range.  In addition, a very large, and continuing to be supported, line of miniature aircraft (1:144 scale) are available.  Each aircraft comes with a maneuver deck, and a clear plastic stand the illustrates things like the firing arc, and the deck type the aircraft uses for maneuver and shooting.In Wings of War (the title I came to know the game under, and the version that I own), you pilot individual aircraft, each with their own behavior characteristics, although a single player may actually control more than one aircraft.  The individual characteristics are these: Different gunnery ability (signified by a letter, which determines which deck of cards to draw from when shooting), different maneuver ability (signified by different decks of maneuver cards, each deck making different maneuvers available for a player to select from, when moving his aircraft; more nimble planes are reflected by having maneuvers that reflect such; more powerful planes have maneuvers that reflect moving further in the same period of time), and each type of aircraft is different by having a different amount of damage it can take.Additional sets of planes and rules have been released under each version of the game, allowing for other types of air combatants, other than the typical (and iconic) single engine fighter (biplane, triplane, or monoplane).  Those additional units include bombers, exotic fighters, and even balloons.The game is lightweight, but is extremely satisfying to play.  It scales very large (so you can have large groups of pilots flying in the same game, the only limit is getting gamers all piled up together to control their fighters in tight dogfights.  It gives you the basics that you need to play a dogfighting game - a simple (intuitive) way to move/maneuver, and a simple (intuitive) way to handle combat.  What makes this so satisfying is that - (1) being able to maneuver, with limited field of fire weapons, leads to actual dogfighting, where players are trying to out think and out maneuver each other, and (2) the ability to shoot at each other gives an immediate feedback as to how well the contest is going, because you can get a feel for how much damage (in this game, in terms of how many damage cards, even if you don't know the value of each) each other is taking.This is a very successful mix, and gives enough for a fun game.  The interactions between the players, and any scenarios that are used to give structure to the basic game (fly and shoot), mean that there is an easy way to ensure re-playability.  But, really, this lowest common denominator (move and shoot) is enough for this sort of game.  It has been used in a bunch of other similar games, all very successful.Those include Blue Max (from GDW; now released as Canvas Eagles), although Blue Max adds some more complication to the Shooting mechanism, by introducing multiple hit locations on the aircraft, rather than a simple damage total.Other WWI flying games where it has been done are Richthofen's War (Avalon Hill), Dogfight (Milton Bradley), Red Baron (Wargamer magazine) and Knights of the Air (TSR). An argument can also be made that the flip book game, Ace of Aces (Flying Buffalo) is of this family of games.Each of these games adds some minor variations to the basic Shoot and Move mix.  Some use dice, some use cards, Ace of Aces uses a clever, integrated system of looking up page numbers in a book, based on what existed conditions prevail when the decision to move is made.  Some use hexes, some use free movement.  One thing that gets added to each of these games, which I really don't believe is necessary, is the aspect of Altitude.  This is not necessary, in my opinion, for the basic fun mix of Shooting and Moving.  It tends to lengthen the game, and doesn't really add too much to the basic move/shoot mix.  The same thing was true of the old Superior Models' game Starfleet Wars.  The effort to implement altitude changes, and the ability to maneuver in the third dimension, as well as the changes to shooting - just ain't worth the hassle.Now, to all of this, I would suggest that another game that falls into this niche (and there are many, many) is the game Car Wars.  It is a dogfighting game, especially when played in an arena, involving the ability to Move an Shoot.  Of course, it is not as simple as the games listed here, but in its basic form, it ALMOST is.  Good news for fans of Car Wars - once Steve Jackson Games is done with the new version of OGRE (getting it all shipped out, which should be finished, finally, in the Autumn of 2013), they are going to do a monster box version of Car Wars.  Hooray!"},

{"title": "Gaming weekend in Clemmons", "date": "Monday, September 2, 2013", "text": "The entire staff of Gaming with Chuck (except for the two Battle Cats, who stayed behind at GwC headquarters, to defend against the encroaching hordes) took a journey from Columbus GA up to Clemmons NC, to engage in a weekend of Bacchanalian Ludo-Revelry.  The games played included a variety of board and card games, as well as loads of roleplaying.Roleplaying GamesThe roleplaying consisted of two sessions of Labyrinth Lord, and one session of D&D Next.  Yours truly ran the sessions of Labyrinth Lord (on Friday evening, and also during the day on Saturday).Dan Proctor's wonderful clone game, that copies early D&D so very wellThe Friday night session followed a character building session for folks who didn't have characters.  That included two GwC staff members (Anita and Heidi) as well as.  It was to be the first RPG session ever for Heidi, although she has grown up playing all sorts of games, and hearing her parents and all the friends of the family talk about the RPG aspect of the hobby.  She chose to create, and play, a 1st level Gnome Thief.  The session involved a bridge crossing (with a goblin ambush), some outdoor encounters, and was going to culminate in a short dungeon adventure, but the evening ended before the gaming did.  The action was loosely based in the Gran March of the World of Greyhawk. Section of the phenomenal Darlene map for World of GreyhawkHeidi's character, the Gnome Thief (named Trixie) was not the only newly created character for the evening,  the other players all had new 1st level characters - including Anita rolling up a 1st level female Dwarf fighter named Badb Bigaxe.  Carol had a half elf Ranger called Dil (her name was much longer, and extremely elven, but Dil is a nice nickname).  Marcy played an Elven Druid called Glengaraeth.  Rachel also played a Druid called Aerilyn.  John played a Magic User.The Saturday day session, featured an installment in the ongoing Greyhawk campaign (detailed, moderately, over at the Sword and Potion blog) that I run.  This featured four of the five regular weekly players being present face to face, as well as one player being present via Google Hangouts (he couldn't travel to Clemmons).  In addition to the Wednesday Night All Stars, we had some additional players.  Heidi and Anita had their characters, Trixie the Gnome, and Badb the Dwarf, upped to 2nd level (for survivability reasons) and they joined the fray.  Also, Dil and Aerilyn joined the group, allowing Carol and Rachel to join the game (they were also bumped to 2nd Level).  John and Marcy are regular players on Wednesday nights, so they switched over to their regular characters (John plays a halfling thief named Flinders, and Marcy plays an Elven cleric named Rhysgil).Saturday's adventure was a continuation (and part sidebar) of this much larger group, along the main campaign quest, to investigate a curious dungeon located inside the Rushmoors.  The Rushmoors is a swamp that lies over what was once the heart of the Occluded Empire of Vecna.  One of the most noteworthy locations in the Rushmoors is the Black Tower (or Rotted Tower), which was once the capitol of the Empire.  The characters in this campaign, however, are seeking a curious spot inside the fetid and evil swamp, where a curious dragon ship has crashed into the heart of a huge and ancient cypress tree.  This ship has opened up a portal to another world, and is called \"The Ship between the Worlds\" - also the name of the adventure path the players are following.  This sidebar adventure is inside the Rushmoors, but the dungeon is one where a curious little tribe of fishmen (not too different from Kuo Toa) have an underground temple.  The players invaded, began investigating, and disrupted the nest of evil.  The adventure wasn't finished, but it was a fun time for a long Saturday afternoon of gaming.A different version of Greyhawk, this time showing the Rushmoors, lower left.Sunday's gaming was run by John, and was a short adventure using the latest playtest package of D&D Next.  I made up a character - hailing from the city of Dyvers, at the northern edge of the Gnarley Forest, named \"Robin of the Gnarley Wood\".  The character has a heavy Errol Flynn influence and was quite fun to play as a swashbuckling bravo!Robin of the Gnarley WoodThere were all new characters around - Steve with a wizard, Rachel with a Druid, Marcy with a Cleric, Heidi repeating her Gnome Thief, Rowdy with a Monk, and Carol repeating her Elven Ranger.  It was fun to play, but it still doesn't feel like AD&D (or D&D) to me, yet.Board GamesA wonderful weekend of gaming, that also included some board and card games.  We played a game of Eight Minute Empire.  This is turning out to be quite a fun little game, I can't wait for the release of the successor (which I backed) to come out - Eight Minute Empire Legends from kickstarter.We also played a game of When Zombies Attack. This is a new dice game based on the players trying to survive a zombie attack.  Slightly different than the (superior) Zombie Dice game from Steve Jackson Games, where the players are themselves Zombies, trying to collect Brains.  This game has the dice representing Zombies, and the players trying (through dice rolls) to get rid of the Zombies.  If a player survives a whole round being zombie (dice) free, then they are the winner.  In one or two respects it is superior to Zombie Dice, but in general, I think it will not surpass the original.  The biggest advantage, is not having to keep score.  But, I have heard that it is easy to keep score in Zombie Dice, if one uses little plastic brains or skulls (or similar) instead of writing the score on paper.  Must try.Finally the group played a round of The Resistance.  This was a fun game as a filler between the long Labyrinth Lord session on Saturday, and the evening activity (which was a ctered BBQ dinner and a group viewing of \"The Avengers\" at Steve's wonderful home theater at his house in Greensboro).  We had a great time playing Resistance, even though it was a new game to most of the players.  Everyone fell into it right away, with lots of accusations and paranoia out of the gate.  It was a seven player game, and the Government Spies won!!  Treachery!"},
{"title": "Race Night in Columbus!", "date": "Thursday, August 29, 2013", "text": "Board gaming night tonight in Columbus (GA) at Moxie Games.I learned how to play Dreadball - that was a lot of fun!  A science fiction themed version of Bloodbowl implemented by Mantic, and using the figures from their sci fi universe.  The game comes with Corporates (humans) and Marauders (space orcs).  It is a lot of fun, and for a somewhat simple structure, has a lot of nuance to it in both decision making and also in structure.  Excellent!  I look forward to more in the future.Following Dreadball, I helped to demo a couple of games of Formula D.  We ran two races, the first with five players, and the second with seven players.  Both great games.  I actually played in the second, and came in second place (which is EXTREMELY rare for me in Formula D - I almost always wipe out).The first race was in Hockenheim, and it was a very good race, with Steven (a new player I met tonight, who also learned Tsuro and the X-Wing Miniatures Game) being the first to crash and burn!  He did much better in the second game, finishing third place, I believe.Hockenheim - from Track Pack #2 (Asmodee)The second race, which is a tougher course (without the great big straightaways of HockenheimRing) was Valencia.  Both courses are part of the 2nd Asmodee track pack (from 2009).  This one came in to the final turn with my car in the lead - 14 spaces from the finish line, and I was in 4th gear.  My nearest competitor was Rob, and he was three spaces behind me, and also in 4th gear.  I pushed it up to 5th gear, rolled the dice, and came up with an 11. AAAAAARRRRRGGGGHHHH!!!!! Rob came up second, and was able to cross the finish line with his dice roll.  A great game, and I only did good because I got some lucky breaks.  I think the dice were treating me kindly tonight so I would bring the game out more frequently, because they usually savage me like a Zulu warrior taking apart a steak dinner.Valencia - from Track Pack #2 (Asmodee)It looks like next week will feature Settler's of Catan themed games for Game Night at Moxie (in Columbus GA).  Please come and play, if you can!"},

{"title": "Theremin Thursdays - Real Elves, Real Elf Music", "date": "Friday, August 16, 2013", "text": "Elves in movies and popular culture are a mixed bag.  Likewise elves in gaming.  A recent animated movie opened my eyes to this, although it has been an urge of mine for decades to really explore elves and elfin culture (whatever that may be) in gaming...An interesting article on this same topic, that also brings up a modern urban fantasy novel series (by Anthea Sharp) that has a computer gaming world that is elf land, can be found at Wattpad.  The article is called Fantasy, Faeries . . . and Gaming?What I have here in this article are three parts.  The first provides a categorization for different types of elves in pop culture.  It isn't perfect, but it works for me (and for this article).  Second, I have a review of SOME of the examples of elves and elf music in pop culture - ending with a recommendation for two recent movies on Elves that are both FANTASTIC.  Third, I review the history of Elves in gaming. So, I'll start by establishing up front that it seems to me (a non expert, but a strong amateur, on the subject) that Elves (in both popular culture, as well as gaming) appear in three major supertypes each of which is related to one or more of the others.  (Throughout I will use the word \"Elves\" for the plural of Elf, rather than Elfs.  Elves just feels better. Similarly I would use Dwarves rather than Dwarfs.)The first supertype is that of the (what I call) Elves as Little Person.  This view is popular in a lot of fairy tales outside of Scandinavia.  This is the basis for the idea of cobbler elves - little people that come and help a Shoemaker - or the Keebler Elves (little people who live in trees and make cookies), and also of Santa's Elves. A modern analogy might be the Borrowers (a children's fantasy novel by Mary Norton from 1952).  Fairy Tales and Mythology, of course, does not have as its main goal a hard and well defined taxonomy of mythical beings, but is rather concerned with telling a good story.  So, using it as definitive source material is great, but hardly specific.  Often these type of elves will have wings.  I would consider them (as a distinction) fairies.The second supertype is that of the more human sized (perhaps slightly larger, perhaps slightly smaller) Elf, but also from fairy tales and mythology.  This type is very strongly represented in the Scandinavian tradition, where they are known as the Alfar, which is the name I'll use for them.  Here are found good elves and bad elves, which are sometimes call Light Elves, or Ljósálfar, and Dark Elves, or Dökkálfar.  A good source for these, comes from none other than that late medieval luminary, Snorri Sturluson, in his Prose Edda (an online English translation is here).  At the same time, there was another term, the Black Elves, or Svartálfar.  These last seem to really be a different sort of people, more like evil Dwarves than anything else.  There seems to be some comparison with the inhabitants of the \"other world\" in Celtic (and other) mythology and the Alfar.  If this is true, then in the expanded view of mythological traditions in the British Islands you have not only Little People elves, but also otherworldly Alfar elves, in the Welsh idea of the other world (Annwn), as well as the Irish idea of Tyr Na Nog.  Also, in Shakespeare, you have in Midsummer Night's Dream, the examples of Oberon and Titania.  The Elves Spenser's Faerie Queene seem to fit comfortably in this mold, as well.  One of the chief characteristics of this type of elf is that it dwells in \"another place\" other than the world of Humans.  That other place (whether it is Alfheim, or Queen Titania's Realm, or Annwn) is accessible by and visited by normal humans, especially Heroes, but it has rules that differ from ours.  Typically those rules are perceived of by human beings as Magic.  Good examples come from the Ford illustrations in the multiple volumes of Andrew Lang, as well as some of Arthur Rackham's illustrations (although Rackham also specializes in the Little Person type of elf as well. Other artists working in Elves and Fairies from the late 19th century include Dulac, Maybeck, Hughes, Doyle, Naiash, Fitzgerald, Simmons.The third supertype is that of the modern fantasy literature version of elves, which seem to be strongly based on Tolkien, and his reinterpretation of the Alfar type elves.  Predictably, I will refer to these as Tolkien elves.  There are as many different tales of how the elves are different from humans, as there are fantasy worlds (both novels and gaming), however many seem to suggest that while the elves may have come from a magical place or other world, they are currently in the same world as the humans.  They may be eventually going back to that other world, but during the narrative of the story they are in the main world that humans occupy.  Also, while these sorts of Elves might be magic themselves in and of their origin, they seem to be limited to invoking and performing magic (much as a human who does magic - whether a wizard or a conjurer) while in the main \"human\" world.  As a nod to their magical origin, it is often agreed that they may be better at this than humans.Galadriel by Angus McBrideTo see an excellent example of what the Victorians thought about elves, and faerie land in general, much worse sources exist than The Fairy Mythology by Thomas Keightley (1860).   Here it is for review.  If you like reading mythology, or seeing what the Victorians thought about elves, you could easily spend a few hours on this without batting an eyelash...The Fairy Wood - by Henry Maynell RheamSome thoughts about elven music.  There isn't a lot of real mainstream pop music about elves.  However, if we lift back the cover on the music scene a little bit, dig a little deeper, open up our definition a little wider - and there is a lot of music about elves.Getting the big names out of the way first, in classic Rock and Roll, we have a couple of songs that are candidates.  The first is \"The Battle of Evermore\" from Led Zeppelin.  This song borrows imagery and narrative elements from both The Faerie Queene (Spenser) and also The Lord of the Rings (Tolkien).  Here are the lyrics.The Queen of Light took her bow and then she turned to goThe Prince of Peace embraced the gloom and walked the night aloneOh, dance in the dark night, sing to the morning lightThe Dark Lord rides in force tonight, and time will tell us all Oh, throw down your plow and hoe, race now to my bowSide by side we wait the might, of the darkest of them allI hear the horses thunder down in the valley belowI'm waiting for the angels of Avalon, waiting for the eastern glowThe apples of the valley hold the seeds of happinessThe ground is rich from tender care, which they do not forget, no, no Dance in the dark night, sing to the morning lightThe apples turn to brown and black, the tyrant's face is redOh, war is the common cry, pick up your swords and flyThe sky is filled with good and bad, mortals never know Oh well, the night is long, the beads of time pass slow Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glowThe pain of war cannot exceed the woe of aftermathThe drums will shake the castle wall, the Ringwraiths ride in black (ride on)Sing as you raise your bow, (ride on) shoot straighter than beforeNo comfort has the fire at night that lights the face so coldOh, dance in the dark night, sing to the morning lightThe magic runes are writ in gold to bring the balance back, bring it backAt last the sun is shining, the clouds of blue roll by With flames from the dragon of darkness, the sunlight blinds his eyesOh, bring it back, bring it back... The song had vocals supported by the English folk singer, Sandy Denny.Speaking of English Folk songs, there is the song 700 Elves by the English folk/rock band from the 70s, Steeleye Span.  Here are the English lyrics of the song as performed by Steeleye Span, which is based originally on a Danish song...ChorusSeven hundred elves from out the wood    Foul and grim they were    Down to the farmer's house they went    His meat and drink to shareThere was a farmer in the west and there he chose his groundHe thought to spend the winter there and brought his hawk and houndHe brought with him both hound and cock alone he begged to stayAnd all the deer that roamed the wood had cause to rue the dayHe felled the oak, he felled the birch, the beech nor poplar sparedAnd much was grieved the sullen elves at what the stranger daredHe hewed him baulks and he hewed him beams with eager toil and hasteThen up and spake the woodland elves: “Who's come our wood to waste?” ChorusUp and spake the biggest elf and grimly rolled his eyes:“We'll march upon the farmer's house and hold on him assizeHe's knocking down both wood and bower, he shows us great disdainWe'll make him rue the day he was born and taste of shame and pain.”ChorusAll the elves from out the wood began to dance and springAnd marched towards the farmer's house their lengthy tails to swingThe farmer from his window looked and quickly crossed his breast“Oh woe is me,” the farmer cried, “The elves will be my guests.”In every nook he made a cross and all about the roomAnd off flew many a frightened elf back to his forest gloomSome flew to the east, some flew to the west, some flew to the north awayAnd some flew down the deep ravine and there forever stayChorusA video showing a performance of 700 Elves is on Youtube.Another rock and roll that is concerned with elves is the song Rivendell by Rush.  This is a very interesting song, and has some great lyrics.  Here are the lyrics, followed by a youtube video that uses imagery from the Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings movies.Here are the lyrics for Rivendell by Rush...Sunlight dances through the leavesSoft winds stir the signing treesLying in the warm grassFeel the sun upon your faceElfin songs and endless nightsSweet wine and soft relaxing lightsTime will never touch youHere in this enchanted placeYou feel there's something calling youYou're wanting to returnTo where the misty mountains rise and friendly fires burnA place you can escape the worldWhere the dark lord cannot goPeace of mind and sanctuary by loud water's flowI've traveled now for many milesIt feels so good to see the smiles ofFriends who never left your mindWhen you were far awayFrom the golden light of coming dawnTill the twilight where the sun is goneWe treasure ev'ry seasonAnd ev'ry passing dayWe feel the coming of a new dayDarkness gives way to light a new wayStop here for a while until the world,The world calls you awayYet you know I've had the feelingStanding with my senses reelingThis is the place to grow old tillI reach my final day.Al Stewart recorded a song in 1966 called The Elf, and it has some pretty good lyrics and also a good sound.  I have read that Jimmy Page played on that track, but I can't confirm.  The lyrics are very good, and certainly in the Annwn tradition of an Elf from another place, with magical abilities while in this world.Here are the lyrics to Al Stewart's song (he of \"Year of the Cat\" fame) - I sat upon the evening hill The shadows set, the night grew still And as I sat, guitar on knee A voice of flowers called to meSing, sing to me your song Sing, for I belong to the night In the gray morning light, I'll be goneI turned with eyes that strained for sight And there amid the failing light Dimly saw a figure small Heard a voice of magic callSing, sing to me your song Sing, for I belong to the night In the gray morning light, I'll be goneMy fumbling fingers found the chords My trembling lips fought for the words I stopped to ask the stranger how He softly said, \"No questions now\"Sing, sing to me your song Sing, for I belong to the night In the gray morning light, I'll be goneThen with the magic of the elves My fingers danced among themselves A heart with lightness thus endowed Formed melodies I know not howSong played the whole night long Thus he danced and laughed through the night And with gray morning light, he was goneNow, the whispering wind plays over the hill And the evening sounds again grow still A year or more has passed since then Oh, he will not pass my way againSo, I sing, sing to you my song Sing for I belong to the night In the gray morning light, I'll be goneThere is a recording of The Elf on Youtube.Ronnie James Dio recorded a song called The Elves when he was in the band Amber Velvet.  He went on to be in a band called Elf.Finally, there are a number of modern bands that are doing fantasy themed music that is certainly quite \"elven\" in feel, and sometimes even in title and lyric.  Check out Narsilion for an example.  A lot of people think that Elegia by Adiemus sounds quite elven, as well.But... but... the thing that got me super inspired on this topic - and I know we are already about a country mile down into the posting before I get to this - the recent movie Epic.  It really does a great job of portraying elves.  It takes category one elves (little people), mixes in some of the mythical elements of category two elves (alfar), and finally treats them seriously as category three elves (Tolkien).  The movie is great - everything that a good fantasy movie should be.  The animation is good.  The soundtrack is fantastic (great Danny Elfman stuff).  If you haven't seen it - go see it.  If you can't - buy it, rent it, stream it - it is a good flick!!The first track on the soundtrack is short, but really captures the classic Heroic feel of the tracks.I have two pet peeves about the movie.  First - no need for the slugs.  This is an unabashed epic hero adventure - both for the young Leafman (Elf soldier) and also for the young lady (daughter of a scientist who thinks he has seen the elves).  The slugs are bantha poodoo.  Second - 3D.  I still hate it.Okay, I couldn't end this without a nod to another recent Elf movie, although it might not be so obvious as Epic.  That movie is Arrietty from Studio Ghibli.This is based on The Borrowers (which are classic examples of Category One elves - the Little People), but it has that wonderful Hayao Miyazaki twist on it.  Very, very well done.  Great soundtrack, good animation, lots of good adventure, and the best thing - this treats the effects of being really, really small seriously, and things like air currents and house infrastructure and sound are all treated very well, and believable (if you can believe 3\" tall people).  Great stuff.  Here is a music track from the movie - very nicely done. This is Arrietty's Song, sung by Cecile Corbel, in Japanese.I won't mention Princess Mononoke (looking up the movie and music from it are left as an exercise for the reader) :-)Okay - so plenty about Elves and Music. Now about Elves and Gaming.  Lots of possible starting points, but I think one could be forgiven for beginning with the Fantasy Supplement to Chainmail. There, Elves are treated as Heavy Infantry.  This plays into a zeitgeist image that lots of people seem to recall from some Victorian art of Elves in a sort of super-magical chainmail that is quite elegant and form fitting.  Much more lovely, and more useful, than the real thing.This same imagery was the inspiration for the wonderful Elven miniatures that were sculpted by Tom Meier for Ral Partha in the 70s, and beyond, leading to his own company of Thunderbolt Mountain. Tom also did a series of his elves for Citadel at one point.  There is a Flickr page with images of many of his Ral Partha elves here.Once the (now) popular Warhammer rules for miniatures games came out (in the 1983 for the original edition) one of the mainstays of the game's many popular army themes was Elves.  They quickly (by the introduction of the first Forces of Fantasy supplement for the first game) bifurcated into Wood Elves and High Elves.  This seemed to mimic the thinking of the time from Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, which following it's predecessors (first Dungeons and Dragons, and before that, the Fantasy Supplement of Chainmail) had elves as one of the main races that the players could have their character represent.At this point it should be pointed out that all of these examples of elves are very typically Category Three type elves - Tolkien type Elves.  These are the sort made popular in the novels of JRR Tolkien, and also in the rise of popular Fantasy novels in the 1970s (and somewhat before) in stuff like the Terry Brooks Shannara novels.AD&D had elves split into different subraces (cultures) such as High Elves, Grey Elves and so forth.  This was a mimicry of the different sorts of elves that exist in Tolkien's Middle Earth setting.  The two distinct versions in the Warhammer setting are the Wood Elves (which have a distinctly Barbaric, woodland dwelling Celtic feel to them), and the High Elves (which have a feel very similar to the imagery portrayed by Tom Meier's Deep Elves - the extremely elaborate workmanship on armor and weapons, extremely decorative, but quite deadly.  Given over to deep, centuries long study of music, magic, philosophy and other heavier thoughts, High Elves are also quite formidable when it comes to making war.There is a bit of a feel of the Warhammer High Elves that is borrowed from the Melbinoean race of the Elric novels by Michael Moorcock.  But that race from fiction would go on to inspire, in gaming, in many different ways, a lot of the different versions of Dark Elves.  In the AD&D setting, going back to the classic Giants adventures penned by Gary Gygax, the Dark Elves were a sort of mix between Alfar and Svartalfar - they lived underground, were distinctly evil, but had many of the traits of elves - understanding of magic and a manufacturing of fantastic artifacts.If one considers all the many treatments of elves that take place in Fantasy Role Playing games, or even Fantasy Miniatures Games, then this would be an extremely long article.  Instead, I want to offer up three different examples from board gaming, and then call it quits.The first is the old Chaosium game not that old, as these things are counted, it is from 1978) called \"Stomp!\".Stomp! is a fun microgame, that pits a giant vs. a pack of elves who have wandered into the Giant's garden.  The elves are individually modeled as counters, armed with a variety of (hopeless) anti-Giant weapons.  The giant himself (or herself?) is modeled as two counters representing the giant's feet.  The giant (as the name suggests) is determined to squash the elves.  Great fun for the giant...Sidebar: The action in Stomp! takes place in a giant's garden.  Just like the wonderful Oscar Wilde story, \"The Selfish Giant\".  Given Mr. Wilde's notorious reputation as an anti-religious free thinker, I have always loved The Selfish Giant, but marveled at the Christian tones of the story.  It is wonderful, and in the early 70s there was an animated movie (originally a 10 minute short, turned into a 30 minute TV special, which I must have watched as a kid about a zillion times).  Here is a version from youtube.  Definitely worth the 30 minutes of your time, but there is little to wargame here, and even less to do with elves.For those who are interested in such things, there is a nice musical version (with some really nice fantasy illustrations accompanying it) that has been composed by Dan Goeller, information is available at http://www.selfishgiantmusic.com/.  Okay, back to elves, and Stomp!Stomp! was done by Chaosium in the 1970s.  That was their hayday of involvement in Runequest (second edition is still one of the best that was ever done, or so the opinion of Gaming with Chuck staff will attest).  In Runequest, at least in classic Runequest (as it SHOULD be played), the action takes place in the fantasy world of Glorantha.  The elves of that world are called the Aldryami, and are actually sort of vegetable people.  Don't push this too far - they don't have leaves (I don't think - I've never seen one without reasonable clothing on).  But they are extremely closely related to trees, the different subspecies being related to different types of trees.  It is rumored that certain tribes of Glorantha trolls will eat Elves, and still consider themselves to be vegetarian.Runequest ElfStomp! as a game, featured one large and powerful unit (the Giant) vs. a number of smaller annoying but easily dispatched units (the Elves).  This was done in a number of other games, most notably OGRE - a favorite here at Gaming with Chuck.  Similar games where the large indestructible unit was not IN the game, but was rather the setting OF the game included the space games Annihilator and Berserker!The first of these two, Annihilator, was about a giant robotic starship that was bent on destruction.  The interior of the ship was protected by security systems and robots and so forth, and the invading player had to deal with those in order to deactivate the Annihilator and win the game.  It was a Metagaming Microgame (as was OGRE), but this time it was part of a two pack, along with a game about religous war called One World. Fun game, but no elves.The second of the two mentioned, Berserker, was about giant robot death machines left over from an ancient galactic struggle, and they are attempting to destroy planets and life.  Based on the FANTASTIC stories by Fred Saberhagen.  The game was from Mayfair (long before they heard of the little words \"Settlers of Catan\"), and it was a lot of fun.  Not a great game (kind of a dog), but fun to fool around with, especially if you like the stories.  Still, no elves, but the Berserker fulfills the role of Giant nicely.One more title that should be mentioned where the players on one side are attacking a large, tough to beat foe on the other side, is Snit's Revenge!  Nothing at all about Elves here, but it is about a band of small, easily defeated critters (the Snits) who decide that they have had enough of being smashed by the Bolotumus - actually there are several Bolotomi, lurking about on the beach, and when the Snits get the URGE!!! to run up on the beach, and stick their snotch in a snandergrab, in order to breed - the Bolotomi think it is great fun to smash them - the original game, published in Dragon Magazine was about that part of this bizarre ecology, and was titled (appropriately) Snit Smashing!  In the follow on, the Snits have had enough, and they decide to invade the body of one of the Bolotomi - running into various orafices on the Bolotomus body, and then proceeding to try and kick the life out of the Bolotomus by destroying his internal organs and the thingies (technical term from the game) that swim around and make them work.  Wonderful, fantastic game.  Best wargame ever (probably not). But it is about a lot of small units (the Snits) taking on a large and unstoppable foe (the Bolotomus) - but still, no elves.The board of the 1978 version of Snit's Revenge, showing the inside of a Bolotomus. No elves.Some images from the Snit's Revenge rulebook are worth sharing here - the comic back story by the wonderful genius mind of Tom Wham (who illustrated and wrote the game - and a bunch of other wonderful games, for TSR, notably Dragon Magazine).The predecessor - Snit Smashing - was originally published in Dragon Magazine, vol 2 number 4 (1977).  It was followed in the next issue by Snit's Revenge (vol 2 number 5), which then got a board game treatment a year later (1978) - which is the edition I bought (featuring a slip cover, that velcroed together, pictured above - and nice glossy cardboard snits, runengettims, makums, snorgs and all the usual stuff from a wargame), and still own.  There were two other editions - a large Monopoly sized boxed set in 1980 (bleah) and then a Steve Jackson Games reprint in 2004, that included both titles and some more.  No elves in any edition, however.War of the Ring from SPI.  Finally a game with Real Elves?Speaking of that era in gaming, a title that did feature Elves was the SPI wargame, the War of the Ring, published in 1977.  This was a great game (a GREAT game) that featured two levels of play.  Both took place on the iconic map of Middle Earth that corresponds to the one by Professor Tolkien in his fantastic trilogy, The Lord of the Rings.  The first version of the game, was a bunch of characters on both sides - the 9 members of the fellowship on the good side, and the 9 nazgul on the bad side.  The Fellowship characters were trying to get the ring to Mount Doom for destruction, and the nazgul were trying to capture it to deliver it to old Sauron.  The second version of the game included all of that, but also going on on the same map was the massive war of the ring -with the armies of orcs, half orcs, snaga orcs, trolls, uruk hai orcs, olog hai trolls, monsters, and other fun stuff on the side of Sauron (I still remember the MASSIVE combat factors of the Olog Hai trolls and the Uruk Hai orcs).  On the good side, there are the characters already mentioned, and a bunch of other characters (Eowyn, Treebeard, etc), as well as armies of Men, Elves, Dwarves and if I recall, even a Shire military unit (the shire moot - the sheriff and a bunch of armed hooligan hobbits, on fat ponies and looking for trouble).  The game was wonderful.  I have no idea if the Fantasy Flight modern version (a different game, but the same massive scope and excellent production quality) is as good, it is on my wargaming bucket list.The elves are Green, as they should be.The original version of the SPI title came out as a typical SPI flat pack, which you could buy alone, or with two other titles (Gondor and Sauron - in the \"Games of Middle Earth\" set, it should have been a quad, but that would require a fourth title).  Then a bit later, as SPI was pushing into traditional retail outlets like book stores and toy stores, they cut a deal with Ralph Bakshi (responsible for the Lord of the Rings animated movie) to use some of his art to market a boxed bookshelf version of just the main game.  This version came with a mounted color board, and was the version I owned and played lovingly many times.Finally, a game with Elves in it.Each of the characters had a card that detailed their abilities and combat (and magic) statistics.  Here is Legolas (an actual elf).Legolas GreenleafNotice, this is an actual elf.  From a game.  The point of the article, after all.  Now, to turn to a modern rendition of the Tolkien saga, we compare this 1970s version from the wonderfully talented gaming artist, Tim Kirk, to the version portrayed in the Peter Jackson films.Legolas GreenleafPut the hood up on that homey, and by jove - he looks the same!  Finally, an actual elf. And here is some actual elf music, featuring none other than the legendary Legolas Greenleaf singing. Real Elf Singing.As mentioned, there were other titles in the Games of Middle Earth series, notably Gondor (about the Battle of the Pelennor Fields - few elves participating, so we will ignore this important battle for now), and Sauron.  This second one, Sauron, is about the battle in front of the Gates of Mordor, on the battle plain of Dagorlad. This was the Battle of the Dagorlad Plains which would precede the 7 year Siege of Barad Dur (the fortress protecting the entrance to Mordor).  It featured an army of Men (including Isildur) and Elves (Elrond, er, Agent Smith, was supposedly there, but it doesn't list it on the stats of his Topps baseball card - you'd think that a big event like the Siege of Barad Dur would be listed on the guys baseball card) commanded by Gil Galad and Elendil - both killed. Their place was taken by Cirdan, Elrond, . The battle plain would later become a marsh (the haunted marshes where Gollum and Frodo have so much fun together during the Trilogy).  The gaming treatment of the battle by SPI featured a number of counters for different units, here is a picture of the action.  Notice the number of Real Elves pictured here, as well as Isildur, riding up the road to the gates, to chop off someone's finger.Disruption markers based on big magic from Sauron.  Not enough for the big guy, Isildur is coming.Now compare that to the version from the Peter Jackson movies...Elves on the left (blue counters in the SPI game, alongside dwarves and men), and orcs on the right (red counters in the SPI game).  A good match.  Once again, Real Elves.Notice that all of these SPI titles were preceded by a Magazine game, on the Siege of Barad Dur - in Jagdpanther Magazine, back in 1975.  Here is an image of the original components -Note: Not real elves.That wraps up this edition of Theremin Thursdays.  This was a fun topic, and one that could go on forever and ever.  The one area I wanted to touch on, but did not, were the great Elf games (Elfenland, Elfenroads) by Alan Moon.  I particularly like King of the Elves - a travel game, much like his Ticket to Ride, but played differently and not with trains, and not with set collection, and with elves and with troll porters and interesting stuff like the wind powered Elf cycle.On second thought, it is nothing like Ticket to Ride, but I like both, and King of the Elves has real elves in it.  Ticket to Ride - not so much.  Except maybe on the cover art of Ticket To Ride: Nordic Countries. For a Ticket to Ride elf, see here:One last time - A real elf.Finally, to end this, I will offer up one last piece of Elf music - from an independent fellow named Hermey.And remember, that is Real Elf Music too.  And as much as you might not like the idea of Hermey being an elf (also recall he is a Dentist), I will present that it is much more real than this (see below) ever should have been.  Sorry, Wendy and Richard - I loved the stories, but I never thought they were elves."},

{"title": "Conquer the World - in less than 10 minutes", "date": "Monday, August 5, 2013", "text": "Got a copy of Eight-Minute Empire recently, as part of the kickstarter that backs Eight Minute Empire Legends. Cracked it open, and gave it a play with the staff here at Gaming with Chuck HQ.We enjoyed it.  It was quick (first time play, with three players, maybe 15 minutes - I could see this taking only 8 minutes once players are veteran with the concept).  It is am empire building game (sort of).  All of the basics are there - resource management, economic growth, conquest, territorial gains, positional strategy.  Sort of.The map (the game comes with two), cubes are armies, discs are cities, round tokens are a variant (preplaced resources)The game play is quite simple.  There are a number of cards visible, and available.  On your turn you select one and then add it to your growing collection of sets, that may be worth victory points at the end of the game (cards each have a resource on them, which combine into sets worth victory points).  Each card also has 1 action that you perform, that affects the empire situation on the (simple, but attractive) game board.  Some of the cards are \"wild\" which means they still have an action to perform, but may be used as any resource at the end of the game (to build larger sets).The actions have to do with (1) placing armies, (2) moving armies, (3) removing opponent armies, (4) building cities.  Cities are the same as an army, but once built cannot move, and cannot be removed.The selection of a card may be free, or it may cost you some gold pieces (each player has a stash given to them at the beginning of the game, to allow judicious expenditure in order to take a card early in it's appearance into the game).The end of the game has a score calculated based on (1) one point for each territory where you have the most pieces, (2) one point for each continent where you have the most pieces, (3) points based on the sets of resources you turn in.Simple, decisions abound, nice straight forward strategy, two paths to victory (territory conquest, or cards).In all, we think it is a win."},

{"title": "Frederick's War - new Hold the Line title from Worthington Games", "date": "Wednesday, July 31, 2013", "text": "I recently received my copy of Frederick's War from Worthington Games (full title: Hold the Line: Frederick's War).  It also came with the extra module Highland Charge, which covers battles in Scotland of the Jacobite Rebellion. The game is a follow on to the (in my opinion) very well done Hold the Line, which was a sequence of battles from the American War for Independence.  That game also had an add-on module, covering the French and Indian War.The game has very attractive counters, a very functional map (with multiple terrain tiles so you can reset for any of the different scenario maps), a great full color rulebook, and a couple of dice.My only comment on the components is that I really preferred the wider infantry unit markers from the original Hold the Line. It made them feel like battalions in line formation.  But, as the scale of the battles represented in Frederick's War is so great, that each marker is representing much more than a battalion (or even a regiment), it probably doesn't matter.I was an early (pre-production) backer of this, and I have to say that Worthington did a very good job in getting it out.The rulebook is great (one minor flub, and might be my own error), and covers a number of key Seven Years War (and the earlier War of the Austrian Succession) scenarios that were pivotal for Prussian (and Frederick II himself).  If this title is successful, I could easily see additional add-on modules featuring other armies and more scenarios from this time period (or even stretching it back to the early 18th century - I would be first in line, for instance, for a \"Hold the Line: Peter The Great\" module featuring Swedish and Russian armies and scenarios from the Great Northern War).A promo picture is circulating (still) on Boardgame Geek and other places that features a shot of some units on a board, and it features some British units - units that only appear in the Highland Charge module.  Not a big deal, but hopefully it isn't too misleading for folks.  On Board Game Geek, Sean Chick (designer) himself comments that it was a mistake so show them in the image.I am looking forward to a solo play of this game, and I will post an AAR of it.Oh - the minor flub in the rulebook that I mentioned - I couldn't find in the text that in combat, units all roll 3d6 in all situations (except fire combat at long range, where it is reduced to 1d6).  It is mentioned on the quick reference chart for combat, but not in the rules text.  There, the number of dice in combat is only mentioned as \"fire combat dice\" on a fire combat table, but there are at least two other types of combat, so by making the mention explicitly for fire combat, it threw me when I was trying to see how many dice are rolled for close combat (for infantry) and for charges (for cavalry).  Minor point, and it was cleared up in the examples, and by the line on the QR chart, but still - what is a review without pointing out one wart in an otherwise very compelling looking game??Conceptually - the game and the scenarios look great.  I do have a minor quibble there - but in the end, my complaint will probably be a recognized strength of the game.  Here it is - considering the size of the armies that encountered each other in these battles, the number of maneuver elements in the game seems surprisingly low.  The battles in the American War of Independence are quite small in comparison, and many of them feature more maneuver elements than the battles here (please forgive: this is only my opinion, and only after an initial un-boxing and read-through of the rules and scenario).  With the original game in my mind, these battles seem more like skirmishes than the epic 18th century struggles that they were...  I will report back after playing a battle or two.Great image of Frederick leading the way at Mollwitz (could have been cover art)Here is an image from BGG showing the setup for the battle of Mollwitz (April 10, 1741; Prussian v. Austria; The War of Austrian Succession) the image was originally posted by Scott Smith:The Austrians (white markers) are set up in (roughly) one line, and the Prussians (blue markers) are set up in two dispersed lines (three infantry each) with some artillery out front, and some outlying flankers.  This battle was fought between 22,000 on the Prussian side vs. 23,000 on the Austrian side.  Here is a nice reconstruction map:Also, definitely check out the web page of Mike Bishop - he has a great map of the battle there as well.So, with armies of around 20,000 (my exact numbers could be off, I have seen totals for the Prussians ranging from 16,000 to 22,000, depending on what you count, and who is doing the counting), it just feels a little more like a skirmish encounter than a large battle to have around a dozen counters.Here is an example from the first game - the battle of Bemis Heights (day two of the Battle of Sarratoga).  This battle featured 8,000 Rebels against 5,000 British.  Here is a picture of the game setup.As I mentioned, I believe once I play the game, the number of counters will feel \"right\", and the discrepancy of scale between battles shouldn't matter (it is the game that matters, after all).  It is just a thought that occurred to me as I looked at the battles.  I won't go into the battle of Hochkirch (which is also a scenario in Frederick's War) featuring 35,000 Prussians v. 80,000 Austrians...  I will hold my breath until I play the game (which I am sure will play very enjoyably)."},

Orbit 2 - The next orbit out is already in the habitable zone, but still within the jump shadow of Beta Aurelis.  This is a very small world, size 1, called Mite.  Mite has a natural satellite, Gnat, which is only slightly smaller.  The two have almost a coequal orbit around each other, but Mite, because of its slightly higher mass, remains the centroid (although it is wobbly).  Mite has no atmosphere and no free standing liquids.Mite has some very interesting crystalline formations in subsurface caves.  This has attracted a large (pop 7,000) processing facility to have been erected.  The entire facility is located in underground habitations, called Vinci Base.  It is run by the NamTek corporation. The value and properties of the crystals is kept under extreme secrecy.Orbit 3 - The first orbit outside the jump shadow of the primary, is the world of Baiti itself - the main world of the system.  It is a size 4 world, but the natural atmosphere and hydrosphere make it a rare gem of a world.  Baiti has two moons, Tut and Ramses.Baiti features a B class star port, with a down port located at Kreft Outpost (the largest point of habitation, with a population of 8,000, mainly a startown around the port), and also a high station called Laughing Fish Orbital Starport.  The name Laughing Fish has some (forgotten) relevance to the early Chinese settlers of this system, from old (pre-Rule of Man) Terra.  In orbit around Baiti is a dispersed manufacturing facility, owned by Posix, a company that makes artificial metals and high strength metal foams (grown in microgravity).  The facility houses 7,000 employees and family members, but is spread over a dozen different facilities.  Much of the spaceship traffic in orbit around Baiti are Posix shuttlebugs flying back and forth between the different stations. Ramses is the home to a sizable Sphere Fenix Scout Base, which also operates the observation crew on the research lab in orbit over Frost, and the X-Boat courier station out in the Shank Ruin asteroid belt.  Tut is the home of a Marlan Primate missionary colony - they operate a very large TL-12 hospital, called Serene Harmony Station.  The missionary colony has a staff of 10,000, mostly technicians and medical staff, but also family members, and an entire meditation temple, with hundreds of monks.  The hospital has its services offered free of charge, but the Brothers and Sisters of the Temple along with Elder Farnush who runs the temple, refuses to allow weapons on the station.  Armed ships docking at the station (which is in orbit around the moon Tut) must agree to weapon-locks while in orbit at the station.  The Government of the Marlan Primate operates an embassy on the planet (Baiti), and this is under control of the secular government, not the temple.  It is located some distance from Kreft Outpost, but is in constant communication.Orbit 4 - The next orbital out, also within the habitable zone, contains the ice world Frost, size 3.  Frost has no natural satellites.Frost is currently under interdiction because of an out of control scientific research project, originally run by the Araminta Scientific corporation, now under control of the Science Directive of the Sphere Fenix Scout Service.  Araminta Scientific built the orbital lab, Research Station K-Nova (staff of 40), and from there introduced robotic agents into the biosphere on the surface of Frost.  These self-replicating machines quickly got out of hand, and began building amazing structures on the surface.  The company maintains their innocence, and claim that something \"took control of the robots\".  The station is now watched over by Scout Service personnel, and the planet (Frost) is under patrol (aerial only, not surface).Orbit 5 - The fifth orbital of interest contains another small rock, similar to Mite, called Little Erg (size 1 rocky world).  It has two smaller satellites, Lance and Fount.Lance has some interesting geo-thermic properties (especially for such a small body), and a small remote station is operated there, by a skeleton crew (and robots) of NamTek corporation personnel - they collect energy, and use it to provide for NamTek starships coming into system.  This is often a point of contention to the operators of the Baiti starports, who see it as lost profit.Orbits 6,7 - The sixth and seventh orbitals contain asteroid belts.  Both of these are still within the habitable zone.  It is guessed that both were once planets, but that something catastrophic happened to them.Char Belt is home to Harbison Stadium - a major grav ball facility, with training camps, multiple arenas, hotels, restaurants, and facilities for tournaments featuring up to 12 teams.  The local team is sponsored by the Scout Service academy, and this is their home stadium.  The Sphere Fenix Scout Service team are called the \"Hummingbirds\" and have had a winning record in recent years.Shank Ruin Belt is home to an X-Boat courier base, Waymark Station, operated by the Scout Service.Orbit 8 - Finally, the eight orbital, outside the habitable zone, and in the outer zone, is the planet Fatal.  Fatal is the same (roughly) size as Baiti, but it is so far away from Beta Aurelis, that it is not really suitable for large scale colonization.  Fatal does not have any natural satellites.The dark and cold surface of Fatal conceals an underground facility known as the Chalmers School.  It is operated by a very old committee of trustees, along with a staff of about 80 (faculty and technicians).  The students are the sons and daughters of noble land owners from Baiti as well as other worlds, who are to be educated in the fine, old traditions of Vilani style noble house traditions.  This includes, as well as traditional education in liberal arts, math and sciences - also important skills such as courtly graces, fencing, poison detection and so forth. The population of 60,000 Sphere Fenix citizens that call Baiti home live, mostly, dispersed over the northern continent of the planet.   The largest concentration (8,000) is at Kreft Outpost, which is mostly a startown surrounding Baiti Downport.  The planet government comes under the rule of the Humas household, with Duke Yancy Humas IV as the current ruler.  House Humas controls government house at Kreft Outpost, and is in theory due the tax receipts of the inhabitants, and serves as a go between providing Sphere Fenix with news from their Marlan Primate neighbors through the embassy here, and providing the Marlan Primate secular government (operating through their Earthly Heaven corporation) with access to Sphere Fenix mercenary troops.The remaining 52,000 live in dispersed colonies across the northern continent, in communities centered around family-bond units (consisting of sometimes a dozen or more adults in a \"contract marriage\" arrangement, with multiple generations of children and extended family members - more like a small company or village than a traditional family).  These are largely self-sufficient, augmented by robots, and seek to harvest the sylph weed that grows across the northern climes.  These family-bond units are somewhat nomadic, following the floating seas of sylph weed waiting for it to come into bloom for the harvest, and avoid upsetting the delicate balance of the ecosystem, prefer to ride the giant tarbants (8000kg beasts, used for riding and pulling vehicles and loads).The southern continent is home to a minor race, the Racivi - a short, slender race of beings appearing like a flightless bird, but with evolved arms and hands replacing wings.  They have a society of clans and chiefs, and live at approximately TL-2.  They are not especially fond of humans.Here is a map of the main world.  Kreft Outpost is located at \"A\".  The northern continent is at \"B\", and the southern continent is at \"C\"."},
{"title": "Traveller Tuesdays - Planetary Map for Nibok (Ark/0302)", "date": "Saturday, July 20, 2013", "text": "[It's not Tuesday, but still - some Traveller material from my ongoing development of the 10 systems in the Etzina Passage]Quoted from the original posting on the Nibok System, we know this about the main world:Nibok itself is a small world, the surface is reasonably diverse, with spread out mountains following the edges of the planet plates.  There are three major seas, and the population (100 million) is located mostly in the cities surrounding the seas.  The three seas are the Calmly Sea, the Serene Sea, and finally the Placid Sea.  The various cities are all controlled by a centrally controlled bureaucracy.  Appointments are by technical examination, and the senior organizing council are chosen by retired workers by bi-annual lot.  The main city, Choden (population 30 million), is home to the organizing council.  The main starport is an island in the middle of the Serene Sea, and is connected to a number of the surrounding population centers by a network of public high-speed tube trains.  The groups of cities around each of the three seas are all also so connected. Taking a look at the map, we can see the three seas, and some other details.  Each hex here is 96km across.  The population, as you can see, is highly concentrated in 9 cities representing 76 million of the total planetary population (100 million).  The remaining population is located in much smaller settlements, and approximately 10 million represent a demographic that has decided to inhabit the lands in and around the central forests just south of the Glynn Jungle.  This population are called the Harp Climbers. These make their home in tree houses, in the towering multi-trunked Harp trees common to the region.  A Harp tree is a lot like a banyan tree from Earth, except that Harp trees can have trunks that each perhaps 20-25 feet in diameter, and the tree itself is massive, towering almost to the heights of a Giant Redwood from Earth.  The canopy of a single Harp tree can be hundreds of meters across, and multiple families are likely to have complex structures built in the extensive branch and trunk structures of one of these giants.First, there are a number of major geographical features that are named.  These include:The Calmly Sea - with the polar ice flows at the northern tip, and the hilly Knotly rainforests at the southern tip.  Location of the Northern Fold of Cities.The Serene Sea, with Losel Island at the center, home to Losel Downport (the main starport of the world). Location of the Central Fold of Cities.Viron Mountains - home to many mining ventures by various corporations.Treacle Mountains - many toxic vents from the geothermic activity throughout this volatile border between planetary plates keep much life from this area.Glynn Jungle - a pre-sentient race of reptilian bipeds occupy much of this jungle.  To the immediate south, as the land dries out, and the vegetation becomes less dense, the giant Harp trees are home to the Harp Climber tribes of humans.Sobear Mountains - Unlike the Treacle Mountains in the northern hemisphere, these towering peaks are home to a wide variety of different types of life.  Very popular as a hunting destination, for leisure.Fannon Jungle - Curious ruins (pre-human) are located here.The Placid Sea - Main source of foodstuffs for the 100 million inhabitants of Nibok. Location of the Southern Fold of Cities.In addition to the various geographical features, there are also a number of main settlements on the world.  As mentioned, the world is under a single, centrally controlled, bureaucracy.  The majority of the population, however, live in a number of cities.  Here are the names, and a few details.Dorji City (5 million) Losel DownportChoden City (30 million) - Seat of the planetary government (the Shrove Council)  Sonam  (3 million)Sangay (20 million) - Built around Sird Temple, seat of the Zen-Sird ReligionKencho (8 million)Dawa Port (3 million)Chencho (2 million)Sherig City (3 million)Lopen  (4 million)The four southern cities (Dawa Port, Chencho, Sherig City and Lopen), all around the Placid Sea, are referred to as the Southern Fold, and the three cities along the coasts of the Calmly Sea (Sonam, Sangay and Kencho) are referred to as the Northern Fold.  The two cities of Choden City and Dorji City, along with Losel Downport, are referred to as the Central Fold.  Losel Downport, and the accompanying starport city on the island surrounding it, are under the direct control of the Sphere Fenix Port Authority, but are still considered part of the Central Fold when the population of locals that work at the starport are part of the conversation."},

Etzina itself has six main political units - the six major city states (ranging in size from 75 million at Kraits Polis, to 180 million at Norunis).  In orbit around Etzina is one of the main operations that represents a cooperative effort between the six city states - the Ford-Basel Power Station - a solar power station that provides ample, free power to the six city states.  The Power Station is an orbital facility, with a crew of 4,000 workers, it is a large, dispersed facility.  Other than the orbital docking bays of the main starport (operated by Norunic city, under Starport Authority permission by Sphere Fenix), the other major orbital facility around the main world is a series of microgravity medical facilities (Chandler Research Hospital).  This is operated by the Maisen Medical School (Maisen was the first colony on Etzina, and remains the oldest city state).Sindar, the moon of Etzina, has a private research lab in orbit around it. The lab is owned by by a patent company, owned Ling Standard Products (a mining and materials megacorporation centered in the Imperium), and the facility is called the Chung-Hayden Materials Lab.  It is concerned with nano-assemblers that can take raw matter and automate the construction of artificial materials with heightened strength.  The facility has a regular population of 20.The Sphere Fenix Navy operates Haven Station - a major orbital naval weapons facility in orbit around Torranz.  There are not civilian facilities in or around Torranz, and other than Naval ships the world is considered to be a red zone to all other traffic.  The population of the orbital facilities (which are quite large, and include a variety of defense capabilities including system boats, weapon satellites and so forth) is approximately 600,000.  The Sphere Fenix Navy regularly operates passenger service for duty personnel, to and from the six cities on Etzina and Optic City on Isenberg.The asteroid belt, which is simply called the Mao Xiu Belt, features a series of three inter-supporting astrophysics educational facilities, operated by the Mardt Science University (Mardt is one of the cities on Etzina).  The largest facility, Jung Observatory has a population of 700, on the surface of asteroid RP-691.  The other two, Jung Annex (population 50) and the Cotter Data Center (population 30) are station keeping free fall facilities.The planet of Erco is rich in certain heavy metals, and an extraction facility (operated by Mul-Cheats Inc., the Ling Standard patent company that also operates the research lab at Sindar) has grown up there to mine and ship the product.  The population of the facility on the surface is approximately 900,000 (a full colony, with families and civic structure, but under company control), but the mined product are then launched into orbit by accelerator, where an orbital reclamation facility captures them for transport.  The orbital facility (Erco Port) is also a colony, with a further population of 100,000.  The population of the whole Erco system keep to themselves, speak Vilani rather than the mixture of Solomani languages used in the rest of the Etzina system, and view themselves as ex-patriates of the Imperium.  The world and its moon are held under patent by Mul-Cheats, Inc.No one has found any reason, so far, to exploit Bermey.  Additional surveys of the world are constantly called for by the various city states of Etzina, yet nothing has happened yet.  It may be a political hot potato.Shaloob is the home to an orbital communications station - a private courier service called Holder Services, that runs couriers within the Etzina system, and also stages for commercial pickup and delivery by ships from outside the system.  The station, called Holder/Etzina Station, has 20 workers and is a largely automated station (the crew are augmented by automatic systems in the station, and a variety of robots)."},

It is a bulky hardcover, weighing in at over 600 pages, chocked full of Traveller goodness.

Slightly harder might result in 3d6 or 4d6.  Very hard will result in 6 or 8 d6 and so on.  There is a formula for determining this, but I suspect a good GM will be able to eyeball it.  Now, the target number for your roll is your appropriate Characteristic number (such as Dexterity or Intelligence) plus your Skill level (such as Piloting, or Stealth).  If your total dice roll is below the sum of these two numbers (Stat plus Skill) then there is success.  Most of the skill descriptions in the book give a basic roll for common situations.  For instance, under the skill Acting, it reports that performing a role in a play is based on Acting skill, and requires a 3d6 roll, trying to get below the sum of (Education + Actor).There are some special dice consideration (open ended dice, meaning those that you get to roll again if you get a certain result), and also some special results considerations - such as spectacular success and spectacular failure.I like it (the skill system).  Much better (to me) than the old Task System from the Digest Group, that got rolled into Mega Traveller.  And also better than the Traveller: The New Era version of the game (which was based on D10, and honestly always felt like I was playing Twilight:2000 in space - probably because it was the same system!).I will probably try my hand at some of the creation sequences in upcoming installments of Traveller Tuesdays.  I'll report back on each section of the rules as I try them out.My version of the game came with a wonderful set of embossed Traveller dice (which I ordered as an add-on through the kickstarter campaign), as well as some really nice 25cr coins from the Third Imperium Traveller universe.  I also got a really nice Patent of Nobility id card with the name of a made-up nobel from the same universe, that was created just for me (neato!).First glance: Lots of very good information, even if you don't play this version, it will give a GM loads of info for their Traveller games.  I give it a Gaming with Chuck thumbs up!"},
{"title": "Fighting over the Shreds of a Fallen World - Cthulhu Wars", "date": "Monday, June 10, 2013", "text": "The staff here at Gaming with Chuck are long time fans of the horror stories written by and inspired by H.P. Lovecraft.  So it should be no surprise that one of the more recent Kickstarter games being backed is none other than \"Cthulhu Wars\".Sandy Peterson (in suspenders, quite proper for an elder statesman of gaming) demoing the game at an H.P. Lovecraft Film FestivalThe Kickstarter campaign is here.  Go check it out, even if you don't become a backer, you'll become impressed with the work they have done.This is a board game, heavily influenced by Sandy Peterson.  His company Green Eye Games is producing the game, and out of the box (with no add-ons) it includes 60 (sixty!) 28mm miniatures.  The sculpts look good, from the promotional videos and pictures on the Kickstarter site, and at Board Game Geek.  See a nice picture of some of the figures here.Sculpt prototype, from Boardgamegeek.comThe board game is about a number of different factions, each composed of the cultists and creatures aligned to a specific Old One.  It seems that the end of the world is nigh, and the Old Ones have returned to consume what is left of the shattered world.  So the four factions (possibly more, after add-ons or expansions of the game are added in) fight with each other to control the planet.  Sort of an Eldritch Risk kind of game.One side of a two sided board, also shown on Boardgamegeek.com There was another game, an older game.  A game out of space and out of time, penned by a pair of cursed hands belonging to two damned souls descended from an ancient, and corrupted race (John Tynes and Jeff Barber).  That game was called \"Creatures and Cultists\" and it was from a publisher of Call of Cthulhu adventures and magazines, called Pagan Publishing.The game eventually ended up in the hands of another company, called EOS Press, and got a facelift from that vile sorcerer from the Plateau of Leng -  John Kovalic.  The game, of course, is a lot of fun, and is also based on the idea of a number of different factions (each serving their own great old one) fighting with each other for the privilege of summoning their own big baddy and destroying the world (devouring human kind in the process).  Loads of fun, but for some reason, I had a lot more fun playing the original, than the EOS version.  Not sure why, maybe there is a rules difference?  Or maybe we have come to expect a different (faster?) experience from our card and board gaming experience, than we did back in 1993."},
{"title": "Wargame Wednesdays - Russian Civil War Rules", "date": "Wednesday, June 5, 2013", "text": "These rules represent some quick and simple rules for doing basic engagements in the Russian Civil War.  Rules for Aircraft and Tchankas have been developed, and even playtested, but are not included here because these rules are specifically being published to support an upcoming game, and only units in that scenario are being presented here.  There is also a more complex version of these rules that have been run at conventions a number of times.  Those (including about a dozen scenarios, and simple campaign rules) will be published here later on, or perhaps published through an online pdf publisher.  The Spanish-American War rules published here back in 2012 were based on an earlier version of these rules.Figures and Battlefield15mm figures  Units are Infantry, Cavalry, Machinegun teams (MGs), Artillery, Tanks, and Armored Cars (A/C).  Infantry stands are 25mm square (or whatever is convenient).  MG and Artillery stands are 30-40mm square (or whatever is convenient).  Tanks and A/C units should be based on bases appropriate for the model.  Units should be organized by stands.  An infantry unit should have between 4 and 6 stands.    A cavalry unit should have between 4 and 6 stands    A Machine Gun unit should have 1 stand    An Artillery unit should have 1 stand    A Tank unit should have 1 stand    An A/C unit should have 1 stand  Each stand should have several figures mounted on it    An Infantry stand should have 3 figures    A Cavalry stand hould have 2 figures    A Machine Gun stand should have 1 MG and 2 crew members    An Artillery stand should have 1 gun and 2 crew members    A Tank stand should have 1 model    An A/C stand should have 1 model  The table top should be prepared before the battle.    The fighting space should have ample areas of cover (patches of trees; windbreaks; farmland walls; road escarpments), especially at the edge of the battlefield.      There should be several small built up areas, on a road network, in the central part of the battlefield.      Roads have no effect in the game, unless they pass through forest, then they permit full speed movement, and also artillery movement    Hills should not be so steep that they affect movement, only line of sight.  Game SetupEach side should have 3 or more commands of troops.  Each command should have a handful of units.  Players dice for set up, high roller has the option of either setting up first, or of setting up second.    First player sets out one whole command, all units should be within six inches of another unit in the same command (this is only enforced at setup).  Second player follows with a command.  This alternates until all brigades are set up.Turn SequenceEach side rolls 2d6 for initiative.  High roller has the option of moving first or second.  If either side (or both sides) roll doubles, then they can nominate one unit on the other side that may not move, this turn.  That unit may still fire, and test morale, etc, and may have to route - but it may not move voluntarily.  If the dice are a tie, roll again.  If the dice are a tie, and both sides rolled doubles, than for that turn no units at all may move, but all units may fire.  The first player elects a command of his that may move.  All units in that command that are not in the process of Routing may move. Players then alternate moving commands.  Infantry, MGs and Artillery move 6 inches per turn.  Tanks and A/Cs may choose to move up to 5d6 worth of inches.  If three of a kind are rolled on any of the dice (three 5s; three 3s; etc) then the unit may not move at all that turn (mechanical problems).  Artillery, Cavalry, Tanks and A/Cs may not enter rough terrain (swamp, forest, etc). Infantry and MG units move half in rough terrain.  If an Artillery unit or MG unit move, they may not shoot.  An Infantry or Cavalry unit may charge the enemy.If this is the case, the unit gets +1d6 inches added to their basic move.  See charges and responses (below) to determine what happens during a charge, and how a unit may respond to being charged.  After all commands have moved then all artillery, tank, A/C and MG fire takes place, simultaneously.  After all artillery and MG fire is done, then all infantry fire takes place, simultaneously. Units charged may fire; charging units may not.  After all firing takes place, then fight hand to hand combat (see charges and responses, below).  Begin next turn.Firing SequenceFiring Ranges    Infantry may fire 12 inches      Cavalry may fire 6 inches      A/C may fire 18 inches      MG may fire 24 inches      Tank may fire 36 inches      Artillery may fire 48 inches    Infantry fire is done by rolling 1d6 per stand firing, and scores a hit on a 5 or 6.  Cavlry fire is done by rolling 1d6 per stand firing, and scores a hit on a 6 only.  MG fire is done by rolling 3d6 per crewman (there are 2 crewman per MG stand, initially), and score a hit on a 5 or 6.  A/C fire as an MG stand (but with shorter range) with 1 crewman (total of 3d6), but may fire at two separate target units (or twice at the same unit).  They score a hit for each 5 or 6.  Artillery fire is done by first picking a target point, then rolling a drift dice and 1d6 (2d6 if over half range). If the drift dice indicates a hit, then good, otherwise drift the target point the amount rolled on the dice.Roll 1d6, and any unit within 1 inch of the landing point takes that many hits.  It is possible for an artillery barrage to \"drift\" past the maximum range of the weapon.  Tank fire is as an MG stand (but with longer range), rolling a total of 6d6.  Infantry units under cover may be fired at, but receive a save of 4,5,6 per hit scored.  Units under cover may fire out of cover, if they are at he edge of that cover.  Hit Results  Infantry and Cavalry units that lose a stand must test morale.  See below for procedure.    Tanks may roll a save vs. every hit they take.  Roll 1d6, on a 4,5,6 the hit does not count.    A/C units may roll a save vs. every hit Except for Tank fire and Artillery fire.  Roll 1d6, on a 4,5,6 the hit does not count.    For vehicles (Tank and A/C), on every turn the vehicle is hit it must test to see if it is destroyed.  Roll 1d6, if the roll is less than or equal to the TOTAL number of hits the unit has suffered in the game so far, it is destroyed.  Roll only once per turn, but count all hits suffered, from previous turns, and all the hits from this turn.    Each infantry stand can suffer three hits before being removed.      Each cavalry stand can suffer two hits before being removed.    Each MG stand can suffer two hits before being removed.  After 1 hit, it can only move half speed.    Each Artillery stand can suffer two hits before being removed.  After 1 hit, it cannot move, but may still pivot to fire.  Charge and ResponseWhen a unit wishes to charge, before measuring the distance to the charger, roll 1d6 and add that many inches to the unit’s move.  If the unit has enough move to contact the enemy, then the charge is a success.  If the unit does not have enough move to contact the enemy, then it stops after moving as far as it can.  The charged unit may shoot during the Firing sequence part of the turn, but only at the charging unit.  The charging unit may not fire, even if it did not contact the enemy.  If the charging unit loses a stand, and then tests morale, it may fail (see below).  If it does fail the morale test, then it does not make contact (but may be shot at by the charged unit).  If the charged unit gets to move after being contacted, and wants to evade, it moves away 1d6 inches. If the charging unit has enough remaining movement to catch it, then it is removed from the game. An evading unit may not fire or charge another unit.  If the charging unit makes contact, then both sides roll 1d6. The higher modified roll wins, the loser taking the difference in hits. The winning unit automatically takes 1 hit. The losing unit automatically routes (see below)The following modifiers affect the dice toss.  Charging unit gets +1 (not vs. MG, Tank, or A/C)    Cavalry unit gets +1    Larger unit gets +1    Unit defending earth works or in a building gets +1    Vehicles fighting Infantry get +1    Elite units get +1  Morale and ResultsWhen a unit has to roll a morale test, roll 1d6, if it is Less than the number of stands remaining it passes.    If a unit fails morale, it has two choices, it can route, or take 1 full stand as casualties.    If a unit routes, move it 2d6\" away from the enemy.  It is marked as routing.    When a routing unit's command is activated in the turn sequence, then roll a morale test for the routing unit, if it passes, it recovers from routing, and may turn to face the enemy.  If it fails, it continues routing (2d6\").    Certain units may have Elite status, if so, add one to the number of stands they have before testing for morale.  Byron Collins - a good friend of mine - has a kickstarter campaign going for the next game from his board game company (Collins Epic Wargames).  Spearpoint 1943 Eastern Front (the original, which takes place in Italy, is a fantastic game, and was nominated for an Origins award).  This is a WW2 card game based on deck construction, but the game is not just a generic deck builder, it also features some very interesting scenarios, as well as dice based combat.  As the game unfolds, it has a great tactical feel to it, and the battle feels like it is moving through stages (first contact; focus forces; and finally decisive engagement).  All in about 30 minutes.http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cewargames/frontline-general-spearpoint-1943-eastern-front"},

{"title": "Game day with the Catawba Military Gaming Society", "date": "Saturday, May 18, 2013", "text": "So, there is a wargaming club in the Charlotte NC area that am proud to have been a part of, some ten years back now, when my Wife and I lived in Rock Hill (in the outskirts of the greater Charlotte Area). We were visiting family in the area this weekend, and I got to spend the day, gaming with the Catawba Military Gaming Society (CMGS).  The game was a WW2 miniatures game set during the Kursk campaign on the eastern front.  It use, of course, the rules called Battlegroup Kursk from Iron Fist Publishing.  This was a really satisfying game. I got to play as a commander on the Russian side, in a sort of modified meeting engagement battle.  On our side, we had a company of T-34/76 tanks, and a company of truck mounted infantry.  Three of the T-34s were carrying squads of SMG armed tank riders.  Along with this, we had a T-70 tank, in a scouting mode, and also a sniper team, and assorted infantry support units (a small howitzer, a heavy machine gun, several light machine guns, etc).Facing us was a German force, with a platoon of PzIVh tanks, and a platoon of StuG-IIIs.  Supporting this was some German infantry, again they were truck mounted, and a few support elements which included a half track towing a Pak38 5cm gun. It was a good scenario, and big thanks to Jerry Frazee for running it.The game has an interesting feature in that each side has a total of points, derived from the units they have, called something like Battle Points (BP).  Every time a loss is sustained (either losing a terrain objective, or losing an AFV or infantry unit), the losing side draws a chit from a cup, representing a loss of points (kept secret) from the total of BP that the side started with.  Once one side hits 0 (zero) then they lose the game.  Elegant.  And it encouraged the capture of terrain objectives, which is always a good thing.The game is a basic I-Go, You-Go type turn sequence, with basic movement rates for infantry and vehicles, depending on their movement mode (cross country or road), and each turn, when an element is activated it has a few choices.  It can go for a close assault move, or it can choose a sequence combining movement and shooting, getting two options to combine (resulting in either move-move, move-shoot, shoot-move, or shoot-shoot).  Or, you can put your unit in a watch mode - either Ambush Fire (works like overwatch does in many games) or on Reactive Move (the move version of overwatch).  Both of those, we learned in our game, are very important, and can contribute greatly to the tactical flexibility of your army.The number of elements that you can activate each turn is determined by a dice toss.  Roll 2d6 and add to that a number representing the strength of your command structure, the result is the number of activations you can do in the turn.  A decent sized game will have you with more elements than you have command points each turn, so there will always be something you want to activate that you did not quite have time to do this turn.  This type of command structure has always appealed to me, as it leaves the player with tough choices each turn.  Certain types of command elements have special orders that they can issue, and the different nationalities have different special commands open up to them.  For instance, on the Russian side, we had an infantry commander, who could for the price of one activation point, activate all infantry units within 5\" of his model, if they were going to do a forward facing full move (basically, a move-move sequence).  This was done several times by the brave heroes of the Revolution, in our game.Shooting is done by measuring range, rolling to observe (if it is direct fire), then rolling for effect (getting hits).  The defender may or may not get a saving throw depending on the type of unit, and if it is in cover or not.  Elements that don't save are killed.  A unit that takes hits must then pass morale or become \"pinned\". A Pinned unit may do nothing until it is unpinned.There are several observer units on each side of the battlefield, as well as an enumerated list of off board artillery assets.  Each side may activate an observer unit (many Germany command and recon elements can also serve as Observers, on the Russian side of the battlefield, not so many) and use it to call in off board artillery.  The method is very similar to other modern games - roll to make the request (typically a 3+ on a single d6), roll to be on target (the worse you roll at this point, the more the barrage drifts), roll for distance and direction of drift, have the barrage land.  Once it lands, it is not so very deadly, as it is irritating.  The falling barrage tends to put target units under it's template (a limited number, not all of them, typically) into a pinned status.As mentioned, everytime a loss is suffered, a chit is pulled that deducts from your BP total.  At the end of a turn, a commander can also decide to pull a chit, in exchange for being able to unpin 1d6 units.  Very touchy decision - after all, your dice roll could always be a 1, or it could be a 6.  Do you take this \"unpin\" option when only one of your units is pinned (even if it is a unit that is crucial to your assault plans?) or do you wait until you have 3, 4, or 5 units pinned, so hopefully you will get your \"money's\" worth, by taking a BP chit, in exchange for the chance to unpin friendlies.All in all, a very nice set of rules.  I liked it a lot.  There is just enough \"Chrome\" here to make it feel like WW2 (and not Space Marines, Russian Civil War, pirate skirmish, or any number of other game experiences, that a more generic ruleset could feel like).  Yes, the rules are simple.  Yes, it is all based on D6 (close assaults, for instance, involve rolling - admittedly small - buckets of dice).  But it is still, in my opinion, a good game.  And a much better, and more flexible system, than say Flames of War.The game was played at the excellent games/comics store Parker, Banner, Kent & Wayne.  This is an excellent FLGS in the old school.  Tons of gaming stuff on hand, loads of game tables, lots of smiling staff, and regulars, hanging around ready to talk about games or gaming.  I immediately fell in love with the store.  If I still lived in the Charlotte area, I could easily see myself becoming a regular here.I don't know the history of the ruleset, but from what I have heard through the rumor mill, this was going to be the WW2 ruleset that the Warhammer Historical rules publishing house was going to release.  Before the knuckleheads responsible decided to ashcan the whole Warhammer Historicals project.  I am glad that Battlegroup Kursk got published.  I understand there is already a book out covering the army lists and scenarios for the invasion of Fortress Europa, called something like Battlegroup Normandy.  Well, good for Iron Fist.  I hope this one goes far, it deserves to.PS - there is a line of supporting hard plastic miniatures, from the Plastic Soldier Company, that go along with the rules (or any other 15mm WW2 game, for that matter).  These models look great, seem to be pretty easy to assemble (I am thinking of ordering some Panzer IIIs for my North Africa collection), and are priced very nice.  There are also a wide number of models in 15mm available from Zvezda, that look great (in my opinion) and are priced very nice.  I think this is a great thing, but I do hope that future rules publishers will get away from having to have the complete package (rules, miniatures, support tools, etc).  One of the things that is so nice about historical miniatures is that your set of nicely painted miniatures can be used to play many, many different games, with many, many different rules.  Having the complete package gives new players who come from the Games Workshop experience, the idea that \"to play game XXX I have to buy XXX miniatures\".  That is always a good attitude to squash, in my opinion!"},

{"title": "19th Century Imaginations - Fictional Naval Forces", "date": "Monday, April 29, 2013", "text": "I have been building up some fictional navies, using balsa wood and other materials, in order to fight out a series of Naval engagements between my two fictional foes from Balkania.  The nations of Furstenberg and Rumpwhistle share some very large common rivers, and both maintain a (second rate) navy during the 1870s, when they were engaged in the 23 Weeks War.Here are some pictures, along with notes, showing the progress of my modeling efforts.Battleships on the left, and Armored Cruisers on the right and in the rearThe four Furstenberg Battleships, in the picture above, are all from the Queen class of battleships.  These were large, masted vessels, like the HMS Warrior from Great Britain, that were fitted out with steam power, and heavy guns on the gun decks.  The Queen class consists of \"Queen of the May\" (launched 1857), \"Queen Guinevere\" (1859), and the two twin queens, \"Queen Titania\" and \"Queen Gloriana\" (both launched 1863).On the right, are three of the Furstenberg Armored Cruiser class.  These were high-sided armored ships, although with wooden frames and decks.  They feature steam power alone (no masts, never constructed for sail), and two large turrets.  The front two are from the Pest class, including (front) the \"Junebug\" (1869), and behind her, the \"Weevil\" (1870).  Behind those two, an older design, from the first class of armored cruisers, the Hound class, it is the \"Moondog\" (1859).Armored Cruisers, and unique Rumpwhistle Battleships on the rightIn this picture, we see four of the newest battleships in Balkania, these were built in Rumpwhistle after the popular Admiral's revolution of the 1850s, and exhibit the latest doctrines of the revolution in their design.  The Admiral's revolution was such that, because no single Canton could afford their own Battleships, and because these were such prestigious vessels, that a Citizen's Counsel of 13 Captains, one from each Canton, would together control each Battleship. At the aft of each battleship, you can note the massive, round cabin, where the Counsel of Citizen-Captains dwell, and hold their meetings about how to run the ship.  The ships, from front to rear, are the \"Longinus\", \"Ephialtes\", \"Iscariot\" and \"Guy Fawkes\".  Being rather forward thinking, and embracing progress, the Revolutionary Government decided that during actions, the Counsel would be reduced to a wieldy Three Citizen-Captains to facilitate quick decisions and decisive action.  Several older Armored Cruisers are to the left, and these are (in capability) very similar to those of FurstenbergHere we see three of the Furstenberg battleships in Line Ahead formation.  In the back, rear, of the shot you can see some of the recently re-based Cavalry of both Furstenberg and Rumwhistle."},
{"title": "Wargaming Wednesdays - Current projects", "date": "Wednesday, April 24, 2013", "text": "So, I don't have anything finished this week to post, so I thought it would be a good time to talk about various projects I have cooking along.At the top of the list are the various projects related to my interest in the fictional wargaming setting, Balkania.  I have several imaginary nations devised, and they interact with several others of some good friends of mine.  Two of the countries I have detailed are Furstenberg and Rumpwhistle, who are (it seems) almost constantly at a state of war with each other.  So I have been working on 19th century troops to get ready to fight some solo battles (the string of actions making up the Maduro Valley campaign, in the 23 Weeks War).  I have the infantry for both sides, and the cavalry for Furstenberg, already based up and ready to go.  I have finished painting and grassing the bases for Furstenberg Infantry and Cavalry, and for the Rumpwhistle Infanty.  I have to still do the R. cavalry, and artillery for both F. and R.  I have been tinkering with a set of rules that favors \"fieldcraft\" or some other name, for a capability of troops to work in rough going.  The 23 Weeks War was characterized by being fought almost entirely in very rough country, and I thought it would be good to have a set of rules that modeled a rewarding battle outcome for the troops who could take advantage of such countryside.  Troops almost done, rules in progress.Simultaneously I have begun modeling a couple of fleets of transition era 19th century fleets, to play out some of the naval battles between Furstenberg, Rumpwhistle and the Urbik pirates.  These are progressing, and I am starting to paint up the battleships and armored cruisers - pictures soon.  Rules already posted to this blog, although some modifications are coming, based on playtest with cardboard ships.My spring semester is almost finished, and summer is coming.  I hope to do some solo Fantasy wargaming, using Hordes of the Things, and a bunch of armies I have painted up already.  Working on an activation system sort of like Commands & Colors, but for HOTT.  Maybe, maybe not.I would like to get some of my troops for either Shieldwall or Age of Arthur begun.  They have been burning a hole in my collection catalog, watiing to be painted for several years now, a project I started and then put on hold when I was finishing my PhD, several years ago.I would like to get troops finished and mounted for some 1700 action, again using imaginary nations from Balkania (Poppenheim and Bombastia). This action would mimic the Great Northern War, mostly, but without the addition of Piles.  I have a copy of Under the Lily Banners that I would really like to try.OGRE/GEV mini campaign.  I started this, but I put it on hold, waiting (waiting...) for the new version of OGRE to ship.  It will have all the maps in it that I could ever want to use for the campaign, so that eliminates the need for me to do my own.  I could use the maps from Shockwave, or Reinforcements, to work this one out, but I would rather wait for the new system.Commands & Colors: Napoleonics - I would like to pay some battles of this - either solo or via Vassal, over the summer.World at War - I would like to get some of the add-ons to this, and play through some of the campaign type battles in the Gamer's Guide, and some of the other supplements.  On my to-acquire list are 1st Panzer, and also Blood & Bridges."},

Similar to Recon but specialized for a wilderness setting.Fieldworks - the character is expert in constructing wilderness based engineering projects, typically of a military value.  This may include log forts, earthworks trenches and earthen gun emplacements.Camouflage - similar to the Stealth skill, but rather than applying to the character himself, the camouflage skill allows the character to be expert at hiding military emplacements, or small troop movements that can be less well detected.  Again, this is only applicable in a wilderness setting.Update Army career, mustering out, and events tables will follow.  This is getting exciting."},
{"title": "19th Century Imaginations - Characters in wargames for imaginary nations", "date": "Monday, April 15, 2013", "text": "Ever since Tony Bath\\\"s Hyboria Campaign (see Rudi Geuden\\\"s great page on the topic), the idea of generating personalities for the various rulers and personalities in the fictional kingdoms an empires involved in wargaming has sort of \"stuck\".  One of the things pointed out in the three part article on the Hyboria Campaign over at Hill Cantons is that Tony\\\"s campaign never was a roleplaying campaign, and although the setting was fantastic, there were no non-earthly elements to it (no overt magic, no spell casters, no fantasty races, etc).  This makes it (as it always has been) the perfect Ur-example of a historical fiction based wargaming campaign from a fantasy setting, but without fantasy elements.  You know - Imagi-Nations.Then along came Role Playing Games, where creating characters became a scientific art (or an artistic science, but whatever - you get the idea).  Lots of creativity, yes, but also lots and lots of rules and structure.For a wargaming campaign setting, however, I don\\\"t believe you NEED to know the minutiae of all that, in order to have compelling characters.  A short run down of capabilities and motives is all that is required.  The system that Howard Whitehouse devised for his terrific game of British Imperial forces vs. the forces of the Mahdi - \"Science vs. Pluck\" is perfect.  It gives some background to the character, an indicator of general experience, and some specific traits.And still . . .Since I DO have role-playing in my blood I think it might be nice to see what specifics each character might have.  So I have been thinking about a role-playing system (it has to be simple, relatively speaking) that might foot the bill.The first that comes to mind, especially given that I am dealing with the second half of the 19th century, is of course Space:1889, that wonderful tour de force from Frank Chadwick, back when one of the greatest gaming companies of all time was still in existence - Game Designer\\\"s Workshop.  The strengths of the system are (1) it is simple, (2) if individual combat (for duels, or assassinations, or whatever) is required, then it is easy to adjudicate, (3) it is made for the Victorian Milieu, and (4) It does have a nice NPC motivation generator.  In fact, I have used Space:1889 character generation in concert with that found in \"Science vs. Pluck\" in the past, and it works extremely well together.  The drawback - since the skill system and statistic system is so simple, there just simply are too many similarities among the characters.  Still, it might work, it might work. The second one that comes to mind, is the D6 system, especially close to the original West End Games version of the Star Wars Role-Playing Game.  This works well, has a nice system that I like (and it is not TOO much different from the Space:1889 adjudication system, not too close either, making it a nice alternative to consider) for skills and combat, and is easy to understand characters from, even if you are not conversant in the rules.  However . . . This one would require a lot of work on my part to create character templates, I think. I\\\"ll have to take a closer look. One of the neat things, however, is the vast number of different settings that the D6 system has been applied to, not least of all the marvelous Pulp games that Peter Schweighofer and his publishing company, Griffon Publishing Studio.Finally, the third one that comes to mind is a game that is based on a cultural world much like that late 19th century, albeit in a pure science fiction environment.  That is Classic Traveller (or more accurately, Classic Traveller as it has been re-envisioned and re-packaged by Mongoose).  This one has all the character types I need - Army officers, Navy officers, Spys, Nobles, Diplomats, Barbarians, Scientists, etc.  It has a great stat/skill system, and a wonderfully non-complicated system for skills and combat.  Unfortunately, inherent in the skill system, are a number of different skills that are Specifically for high-tech science fiction settings (this is appropriate, of course).  And, there is not the clear cut personality attribute generator that exists for both Space:1889 and Science vs. Pluck.  However . . . since neither of those systems has anything to do with the actual statistic or rules system - the could easily be transplanted to Traveller.So - which one to pick?  As Sherlock Holmes would put it, this is definitely a three-pipe problem.  I\\\"ll get right onto smoking those pipes, and come up with a solution, and then start posting here on my decision, along with some game charts to make whichever I choose work for the Balkanian games I work on."},
{"title": "19th Century Imaginations - Rules for Naval Battles", "date": "Friday, April 5, 2013", "text": "Here are some simple rules for playing 19th Century (Transition era) naval actions.  This is the age of the 1850s-1870s when ships still were mast rigged, but had steam power as well.  Ironclads are covered as well.Furstenberg vs. Rumpwhistle in the 23 Weeks WarShips come in two sizes, big and medium.  Which, to show off our saltiness, we can call Battleship (or Ship of the Line) for Big, and Cruiser (or Frigate) for medium.All ships may move under Steam or under Sail.All ships have two types of hit points - Hull and Mast.  These are divided up into three divisions each.Battleships have three mast divisions, each taking 5 points of damage.  They have three hull divisions, each taking 12 points of damage.Cruisers have three mast divisions, each taking 4 points of damage.  They have three hull divisions, each taking 8 points of damage.Sail movement - The ship may roll 1d6 for each (whole or partial) mast division they have left. The ship may choose to roll few dice, but must move all that they roll.The ship moves forward (without turning) the distance of one dice at a time, Captain's choice.After moving ahead, the ship may make a turn - Battleship, up to 45 degrees; Cruiser up to 90 degrees.Vagueness of sail movement is preserved, without worrying about wind gauge, sail setting, etc - boring things that landlubbers THINK we salty captains care about.Steam movement - The ship moves a standard amount, and may make a turn every 4\".  The number of inches varies based on how many hull divisions the ship has left.If the ship has three hull divisions left (whole or partial) then it may move a total of 16\".If the ship has two hull divisions left, then it may move a total of 8\".If the ship has only one hull division left, it may not move via Steam.Turns (every 4\") are as per sail movement - Battleships 45 degrees; Cruisers 90 degrees.Steam engine clouds - Regardless of how far a steam fired ship moves, it leaves a thick cloud over the second half of its movement distance.  This remains for two turns.Shooting - Ships may shoot at anyone within range.  Battleships have 24\" range; Cruisers have 18\" range.  A target is declared, dice are rolled, hits are recorded.Battleships roll 5 dice per hull division they have left (whole or damaged); Cruisers roll 3 dice per hull division that they have left.A target vessel is nominated before rolling, also announce if firing is Regular, High, or Low.  Each division of a firing ship may choose a different target.Regular fire - Roll dice, every 6 scores a Mast hit; every 1 scores a Hull hit.High fire - Roll dice, every 6+ scores a Mast hit.  Half of the 1s rolled score Hull Hits (round up), then reroll the other 1s, this time adding +1 to each die.Low Fire - Roll dice, every 1- scores a Hull hit.  Half of the 6s rolled score Mast hits (round up), then reroll the other 6s, this time subtracting -1 to each die.Damage - All damage (either hulls or masts) goes against one division completely, until that division is gone, and so forth.  No splitting it up.Ships that have lost all three Hull divisions have sunk.Ships that have not sunk are towed home by the victor of the battle.Damaged ships may completely repair one division (hull or mast) per week in a port.Visibility - Ships moving under Steam (i.e. - those with Coal Smoke) lose 1d6 off the total they can roll to shoot with, per division.Cruisers cannot trace a line of fire through a Battleship.All other combinations are possible (battleship firing past anything, or cruiser firing past cruiser).No ship can see past smoke to fire.Ramming - If a ship model can move into another ship model, then the chance for a ram occurs.Roll 1d6 - on a 1,2,3 the ram actually occurs.If the ram does not occur, move the moving ship past the other ship.If a ram occurs, roll all the firing dice that the ship doing the ramming has available to it - i.e. an undamaged Battleship would have 15 dice; a Cruiser missing one hull division would have 6 dice; etc.All 1s rolled do one point of hull damage to the Ramming ship, all 5s and 6s rolled do one point of damage to the ship being rammed.The Torpedo - Cruisers carry one torpedo, Battleships carry two.  They are quite unreliable.A torpedo has 12\" range.A stationary ship (one that has not moved this turn), or a ship under Steam power may fire a torpedo.Nominate a target, if a Battleship fires both of her torpedoes on the same turn, they must be at different targets.Roll 1d6, on a 1 it strikes the target, on a 2-6, it is lost forever.Roll 10d6 on a successful hit, all dice scoring 5,6 will do one hull point of damage.Troops - Battleships may carry two units of troops.  Cruisers may carry only one unit of troops.For these purposes an artillery unit counts as half of a unit. Cavalry units count as two units.A ship may send units ashore, or collect them again, via boats, if they are within 6\" of the shoreline. A unit disembarking or embarking troops via boats may not move during the entire turn of the operation.The troops must begin their move at the shore's edge if embarking; they finish their move at the shore's edge if they have been disembarked.Shore guns - Shore batteries may fire at Ships, and be fired at.Shore guns have 24\" range, and roll 4d6 per battery.  They may only fire normal.Guns in batteries may be targeted by ships.  Each battery takes 2 points of damage to be destroyed.  Once the ship fires, each dice does a point of damage to a shore gun on a 6. If the shore battery is in stoneworks (harbor fort, etc), then reroll each 6, and only the second set of 6s will score hits.For these rules shore batteries typically are either Small (2 batteries), Medium (3 batteries), or Large (4 batteries).Ironclad vessels - The ships described so far are transition ships - still mast rigged, with with steam power included.  There are also Ironclad vessels.Ironclads are neither Battleships nor Cruisers, but a different class of vessel.Ironclads do not have Mast divisions.  They do have three Hull divisions, of 8 points each.Ironclads may only move via steam power.  They may move 12\" if they have all three hull divisions left, and only 6\" if they have two divisions left.  Once they are down to one division, they may not move.Ironclads have two turrets, each rolling 6d6 to fire.  Each turret may target a different target.  They may not fire High or Low, only regular.Once an Ironclad has only two hull divisions left, it may only fire one turret.  Once it is down to one hull division, it may not fire.Mast hits scored against an Ironclad miss.  Hull hits scored against an Ironclad must reroll.  Reroll all hull hits scored, and only on 5s and 6s do they actually do damage.Ironclads that are ramming wooden ships do not take damage.  Ironclads rammed by wooden ships, or by other Ironclads do take damage.Ironclads have one torpedo.Torpedos fired against the Ironclad actually hit on a 1 or 2 (because of the poor handling of the target, not because of magnetic homing).Fighting Battles - Set up the playing surface.  Shorelines, shore batteries, and shoals should be clearly marked.Battleships may not move over shoals.  If they do, they take 1d6 worth of hull points.At the start of each turn, each Admiral rolls 1d6.  A legendary admiral adds +1, the side with more ships trailing smoke (i.e. moving under steam) subtracts -1.  The high score has initiative.The Admiral with initiative decides to move first or second. When a player moves, they move all their units.Once both sides have moved, Shooting is simultaneous.  The side with initiative resolves their shooting first (i.e. declare targets, roll for damage, etc - but all damage takes effect simultaneously).If a ship is of Poor quality (as per scenario or campaign) then the first time it takes damage, immediately roll 1d6.  On a 1 or 2 it strikes its colors, and does not take a further role in the battle.  Otherwise it is okay.Once one side or the other has lost Half of their vessels (a vessel is considered \"lost\" if it is down to only one Hull division, regardless of its fighting ability), that side must begin rolling Morale at the end of each turn.Roll 1d6 for morale.  On a 1 or 2, the side surrenders, and the other side is the victor.  If the side rolling for morale has a Legendary Admiral, subtract one from the roll.  If the other side has a Legendary Admiral, then add one to the roll.To handle smoke,  use two different colored pom pom balls, Gray and Black.  After all the ships on your side move, remove all Gray pom pom balls that belong to you (i.e. were placed by your ships).  Then replace all Black pom pom balls with Gray ones.  Then place new Black pom pom balls behind the second half of movement of your Steam powered vessels."},
{"title": "19th Century Imaginations - Furstenberg Seebataillone", "date": "Sunday, March 31, 2013", "text": "It is difficult for a military adviser from outside Balkania to imagine how a landlocked nation like the Margravate of Furstenberg requires naval infantry, and even more difficult to picture them participating in the 23 Weeks War, which was waged largely in the Karzstan Mountains, and the hill country north into the Confederated Cantons of Rumpwhistle - but both of things are true, and deserve some treatment in the ongoing series of descriptions of troops in this important conflict.The eastern border of Furstenberg is the mighty Krenz River, and it divides Furstenberg from other Balkanian Principalities.  Because of this, and especially because the Krenz also borders Rumpwhistle (although north of it's Furstenberg shorelines), the Margravate maintains a riverine navy.Over the years, this small segment of the Furstenberg military establishment has gained quite a history for its ships and associated men, and has participated in a number of interesting conflicts against other Balkanian powers.  Protecting both the ships and naval facilities are a number of companies of naval infantry.  These serve as on-shore garrisons for the different naval ports, as well as serving on the capital ships of the navy as marine detachments.  They fulfill the typical role - assisting gun crews in combat, providing security for officers, and serving as boarding and shore parties in operations.Together these various units of naval infantry are the Furstenberg Seebataillone (officially listed as just one battalion, albeit closer to division strength, although never gathered together in one place).  It consists of a number of different \"companies\", but each company can be as large as 600 men.  It is the tradition that the troops assigned to either a shore facility or to a single ship are all termed a Company (as in Ship's Company, or the Port Company).  The name should not be confused with a typical infantry company (which in the mid 19th century in Furtenberg is about 150 men). Furstenberg Seebataillon - 1871Around the time of the 23 Weeks War, the Furstenberg Navy was very much still a Navy in Transition, to use the terminology of the day.  It consisted of some 6 ironclad ships, and approximately 24 wooden ships.  Most of the wooden ships had been outfitted with auxilliary steam power, which is quite important when navigating the rivers of Furstenberg.  At the outbreak of the war, none of the ironclads, and only four of the wooden vessels (the aging ship of the line \"Duchess Helga\", the more modern battle cruiser \"Queen of the May\", and the two masted cruisers \"Absinthia\" and \"Eiderduck\") were present on the Dukon River, and all of these were in the river port city of Thorn.  These were rapidly called up to Graatz Province, and their naval infantry companies and some of their guns were made available to the expeditionary forces preparing for war against the Rumpwhistle forces.  The Duchess Helga was not seaworthy at the time, but her Seebataillone company was sent along.Captain Akorn-Tabbac, of the EiderduckOnce in the Graatz naval weapons station at Korndock, the troops were organized.  The 600 men from the Duchess Helga were made into Company One.  The troops off of Absinthia, Queen of the May, and Eiderduck were combined to make up Company Two.  And finally, detachments from Thorn and Korndock were combined into Company Three.  Together with a battery of light guns from the Eiderduck, that were hastily mounted on field carriages, these were deemed a Light Brigade, and sent north to help out in the war.As far as actual naval actions in the war, there was some gunplay between the Eiderduck and Urbik river pirates, on the Dukon River, however this is typical in the region and did not seem to have much to do with the conflict against Rumpwhistle.The three Companies did see action, in a number of different battles, and men of the Duchess Helga company (Seebataillone Co. 1)distinguished themselves at the Battle of Krump's Farm.  The whole brigade was brought together after that action, and during the Maduro Valley campaign, fought together as a unit, under command of Port Admiral Kriegwasser, from Thorn  He had his whole staff with him, which was a mixed blessing.  They were a command that was accustomed to working together, however much of the work they did was to organize ship repairs, supervise operations against river pirates, and handle recruiting and naval logistics.Admiral Kriegwasser and his staff.In 1871, the uniform of the Seebataillon forces consisted of the typical dark blue tunic, similar to that of the infantry (although with Light Blue collar tabs, and according to the Furstenberg military roles, a \"fair amount of gold or red stitching, as befit naval infantry\").  They wore sky blue trousers, tending towards a bloused style (although not as much as the zouave trousers of the Drover Highlanders).  Rifle and kit were very much the same as the Infantry.  Unit distinctions tended to be the name of the ship or port that the company was detached from, stitched around the back of the kepi.  A dress shako, with a naval infantry gold plate as a frontspiece, was rarely worn in the field."},
{"title": "Reaper Bones Kickstarter - Shipping soon!!", "date": "Tuesday, March 26, 2013", "text": "So - Last year, I decided to back the Reaper Miniatures \"Bones\" Kickstarter.  And I am glad I did.  I went in for the $100 level (called the \"Vampire\" package).  And for that I get a metric ton of miniatures, in the new resin material that they are casting in.Here is an awesome website detailing the over 200 figures that are in the Vampire package (currently, they would be valued at  $1153.52, and that doesn't include 24 new miniatures that don't have a current price).  Hover over the figures in the image on that page, to see a detailed shot of each miniature, and it's current cost to purchase (outside the kickstarter). This is a win for the fans (like me) who get a ton of gorgeous miniatures for cheap, and also for Reaper, because it allows them to MASSIVELY expand this line of new material based miniatures.  Previously their Bones line was 22 figures.  The Kickstarter money gave them the capital to begin really expanding that line.  Basically, once setup fees and mold design, etc, are done - making resin figures costs less than nothing per piece.  Handling, packaging, shipping, advertising - those are the costs once setup is done.  But unlike metal molds, I understand that plastics and resins have VERY expensive processes involved.  So - the Kickstarter.Anyway, here is a video of the unboxing - what is in the set (in a big-picture sense) -For a better look at the actual miniatures included - check this out - And here is a static image of what was included in the Vampire package.  Basically, as the Kickstarter campaign progressed, more and more got added to the basic package.  Until *Voila* Loads of cool miniatures, for $100.They are (I understand) on time to ship in March.  I expect my nifty box of goodies to come very soon now. (I upgraded my order by adding in some paint sets, and some Cthulhu Mythos miniatures - it makes me all gooey just thinking about it)."},
{"title": "19th century Imaginations - Furstenberg Alpine Troops", "date": "Monday, March 25, 2013", "text": "In the northern-most regions of both the Kraznikrenz Province and the Protectorate of Graatz, the alpine conditions of the Karzstan Mountains makes life difficult for the locals.  The population is a mixture of Urbs, Bosni-Balkanians and the Karzstan hill people (a rough tribal culture, but not as rough as the Drover Highlanders).  From this mix comes a tradition of mountain hunting that is the perfect basis for forming select units of Alpine Infantry.Furstenberg Alpine UniformThese Karzstan Mountaineers live in rough and rugged country, and make their livelihood by tending tough mountain cattle, and by hunting in the mountains.  They also have to regularly drive off Bosni-Balkanian raiders, and fight in local territorial disputes with the Urb hill tribes that they share their valleys and slopes with.  Because of this, they naturally develop and cultivate the skills that make them expert Alpine infantry.There are six Regiments, each of four battalions, of Alpine Infantry in the Furstenberg Army at the time of the 23 Weeks War.  These are named for the Karzstan valleys that they are recruited from.  Each of the Regiments is numbered, in the Furstenberg Regimental system, but each also retains their traditional names and traditions as well.The first Alpine Regiment, \"34th Alpen\" are also known as the Karzstan Ritter zu Fuss, are an old regiment, going back to the late 16th century.  These were the remnants of a religious order (Ordo Milites du Gourd en Karzstan), ordained several centuries earlier by the Holy See of Balkania.During the late 16th and into the early 17th century, they were responsible for driving out the Urb tribesmen in and around the Aleman river valley, in the southwest reaches of the Karzstan Mountains.  This allowed for the establishment of (what would later become) the frontier city of Alemansberg.  Initially it was a travelers hospital and refuge in the mountains, operated by the Ordo Milites.Grandmaster Horst Gourdkapp, of the Ordo MilitesPainted on the ceiling of the Alemansberg Cathedral of the VineAs time went on, the Order was attracting more and more secular knights, and became known simply as the Karzstan Ritter zu Fuss.  During the Great Northern Furstenberg War, around the turn of the 18th century, units of the Ritter zu Fuss were sent to fight for the Grand Duchy of Poppenheim.  The Ritters were especially noteworthy for their role in the battle of Neugourd, where they held off the massed Bombastia guard regiments, who were advancing on the church Tithe barn that the Ritters were defending.After the wars of Furstenberg Unification, the Ritter Zu Fuss were officially recognized as the first Alpine Regiment, and still retain somewhat of an elite status.  Because of this, the Margravate has almost always allowed the 34th Alpini to muster 6 battalions, rather than the typical 4.  These often see duty with several of the Furstenberg Corps.Col. Friedel Henken, killed February 1872, battle of VineykoppHere is a table of the Alpine Regiments, along with unit distinctions, and the Regimental Commander (typically of the first battalion) of each at the start of the 23 Weeks War.

Friedel Henken was celebrated as a beloved hero, due to his role in mustering mountain troops against the Urbik Horde, during the wars of unification.  At the start of the 23 Weeks War, he was not only at the head of the 34th Regiment, but was also nicknamed by the papers as the \"General of the Mountain Men\".  He was present at the battle of Vineykopp, against the Rumpwhistle forces, in February of 1872.  He was given command of the Alpen Brigade, which consisted of battalions from the 34th, 42nd and 71st.  Also attached were companies of the Simian Jaegers, and a mountain battery from the Alemansberg Freikorps.  Although the crossing of the Vineywasser was defended, the second battalion of the 42nd was decimated, and in an effort to relieve them, Col. Henken (at the head of the first battalion of the 34th) was shot by a Rumpwhistle sharpshooter."},

{"title": "19th Century Imaginations - Rumpwhistle (2 - military of the Confederacy)", "date": "Monday, March 11, 2013", "text": "So, the Confederated Cantons of Rumpwhistle, as the country is known in the later half of the 19th century, has its army organized in two broad parts.  Rumpwhistle also as a small navy, to patrol its coast along the shores of the inland sea, Lake Balkania, but that isn't addressed here.Rumpwhistle InfantryThe first segment of the army is the National Army of Rumpwhistle.  These are troops that are organized to work together, and take their direction from Premier of the Landhouse, who is supposedly the head of the army, but in reality often just appoints generals from the capitol building at Ramshorn.  These troops are funded by Confederacy money, which is often of poor amounts and late in arriving, so because of that the National Army units are often of poorer quality - in terms of both equipment and morale - compared to the second part of the army.  Due to the long heritage of the country as once being a Monarchy (the Earldom of Rumpwhistle), there is a long and proud heritage of sons of the nobility serving in the Army as senior officers.  That tradition, in the late 19th century, still encourages sons of families with money or status, to attend to their ancient military obligations.  Because of this, the officers of the National Army are usually of a high status, and often rather idealistic.The second segment of the army are the Canton Units.  In reality each of the 13 cantons of Rumpwhistle has their own individual army, but these are rather small, and highly variable in size.  However, there is, in the Treaty of Confederation, terms that require the Cantons to submit units for the common defense of the nation at large, and to support each other in case of internal or external threat.There are 9 cantons and 4 independent cities that are treated as cantons - they have seats in the Landhouse, and provide units to the army.  These are listed here.Sutliff - Coal mining country.  Also known for their musicians.  Units frequently accompanied by extra pipers and drummers.Nikovena - Cold mountain country, with thin soil.  The only real economy is sheep herding, and the land is too rocky for many horses.  No cavalry units from Nikovena.  Capitol city is Papaschlemo, and the Canton is always struggling with the local Bosniak population.Gawith - Strong tradition of distilling spirits.  Located along the mountains, Gawith is the home of the Hoggarth Rebels - formerly Drover highlanders aligned to Furstenberg, but during the Cattle Raid wars of the last century, broke off and moved to the Rumpwhistle (Gawith) side of the border.Pease - The trade city of Meridda Hill is in Pease, and it is home to the best armories and foundries in Rumpwhistle.  Pease Artillery units are legendary, at least amongst the Canton armed forces.Fribourg - Hill country.  Home to a very contentious local population.  Given to strong drink, poetry, and reactionary political movements.  They make good infantrymen.  The chief town of Mac Baren is home to the famous Red Guard - volunteers during the civil wars, and rabble rousers the rest of the time.Cornell - Location of the port city, Diehl.  Many foreigners enlist here, making Cornell regiments the most \"exotic\" in make up of all the Canton forces.Stanwell - Farm country, home to a good many horse communities.  Stanwell cavalry is the best in the Confederacy.Dunhill - Coal miners, again.  These fellows are strong in a fight, but they never went anywhere fast.Peterson - Sheep country.  High population, but it is kept mainly in the walled towns, with the countryside given over entirely to the Sheep trade.  The capital of the Confederated Cantons is here, the city of Ramshorn.It is interesting to note that Ramshorn is not considered one of the independent cities, but that was due to the Treaty of Confederation thinking that it was important, and powerful, enough without having its own electors for the position of Premier, or independent representatives to the Landhouse.The four independent cities that DO have Canton status are:Eriksen - City at the junction of Sutliff, Cornell and Fribourg.  Lots of class conflict, between the wealthy traders of Cornell, the miners of Sutliff, and the \"salt of the earth\" people of Fribourg.Wessex - City is in between Stanwell and Peterson.  Wessex stock markets are known for their horses of Stanwell, sheep of Peterson, and sharks of Wessex.Grabow - Between Dunhill and Gawith.  Grabow University is the elite seat of learning for Rumpwhistle.Long - Bordering both Nikovena and Pease.  Marksmanship tradition going back to the middle ages, when Pease Longbowmen were highly sought after mercenaries.Regular Infantry on the left, Canton Infantry on the rightThe last significant focus of military strength in Rumpwhistle isn't a part of the regular armed forces.  That focus is on the various irregular units that will often (but not always) align themselves with the Rumpwhistle forces (either the Confederacy army or the Cantonate forces).   These groups include the following:Urbik Hill Tribes - the ethnic Urbs are a fierce hill people, and will often come together, many different smaller tribes and villages, under a charismatic warlord, to either fight for or against the Rumpwhistle forces, depending on the way the wind is blowing.  Occasionally the Urbs will get caught up into the Pan-Urbik league, which stretches Urbik territory over the nations of Rumpwhistle, Vulgaria, and Furstenberg.  Occasionally Urb tribes will have cavalry, either mounted on horseback, or if they have ties to the tribes from the arid Simian Plains of Furstenberg, they may have camel mounted units.  Urbs are renowned for their deadly accurate rifle fire, and are frequently armed with jezzail long rifles. Urb Hill TribesmenBosniaks - these are wild men of the hills in and around Nikovena.  The original Bosni-Balkanian people of the region have mostly, over the centuries, been integrated with the various European, Asian and Semitic nations that have invaded or colonized, but these represent pure Bosni-Balkanians.  They are sworn enemies of the Urbs, but also of the Rumpwhistle nation.  It is rare that a month goes by without a Bosniak raid on Papaschlemo (the capitol city of the Canton of Nikovena).  It is possible, from time to time, that Bosniak units (occasionally irregular foot scouts, but more likely to be rifle and spear armed light cavalry) will join a Rumpwhistle military column. Bosni-BalkaniansWagon People - there is a culture of nomadic peoples that live in and around the hills of the Fribourg Canton, that are best described as either tinkers or gypsies.  They move around, in large extended family-clans, using horse drawn wagons.  These wagons serve to move the family goods (each adult individual or couple in the family-clan will have one or more wagons), and are peopled either by family members, or by the serfs that they capture in their raids and clan wars.  Again, the wagon people will occasionally join a Rumpwhistle operation, but frequently when it is against either Urbs or Bosniaks.  The fighting style of the Wagon People is to form a defensive \"fort\" by placing their wagons into a laager formation, and firing out against the enemy. Defensive Laager of the Wagon PeopleSo the Confederacy army is divided up into three Corps, but they have different duties.  The first corps, Home Corps, is almost always located at Ramshorn, to provide home guard units, ceremonial duties, and manning the headquarters of the army, Fort Boxtinder. The second corps, also called the Spirit Corps, is used for training and recruiting.  The various units in the Sprit Corps (really it is at division, or lower, strength) are almost all under manned, yet they have a full complement of Officer and support structure.  These units are spread out among the various Cantonate military forces, and provide a reach-back to the Confederacy from those military forces.  The third corps, also known as the Expedition Corps, is kept up at full strength, and is the \"field army\" of the Confederacy, kept at a high level of readiness.  The other parts of the Confederacy army are theoretically available for use, in case of major operations, but it would take some time to mobilize and equip the units.  The Expedition Corps is the first option for military actions in or around Rumpwhistle.Cavalry of the Expedition CorpsExpedition Corps (III Corps, Rumpwhistle Confederacy Army)6th Division   6 regiments of infantry (each 2 battalions)  1 regiment of grenadiers (3 battalions of grenadiers)  1 battalion of jaegers  1 cavalry regiment  1 artillery regiment 8th Division   4 regiments of infantry   2 regiment of grenadiers  2 cavalry regiment  1 artillery regiment 12th Division  6 regiments of infantry (each 2 battalions)  2 battalion of jaegers  2 artillery regiment Terrapin Division  4 regiments of infantry   2 regiment of grenadiers  2 battalion of jaegers  1 cavalry regiment  2 artillery regiment  The next article in this series will cover the Canton troops."},
{"title": "19th Century Imaginations - Rumpwhistle (1 - history)", "date": "Saturday, March 9, 2013", "text": "So, in spite of the danger from Vulgaria, when the Twenty Three Weeks War started because of instigation by university students in Furstenberg it wasn't against the Vulgarian Empire, it was instead against the Confederated Cantons of Rumpwhistle.  Since I am prepping my wargaming armies to be able to fight out the major engagements that were part of this little brush war, I thought it would be prudent to detail some of the background history of Rumpwhistle, and also her military structure.During the later Middle Ages, due to the vagaries of glebe law under the canonical rule of the Balkanian Orthodox church, a large parcel of land passed from a priest, to his third son.  At the same time, the son was forced into a rather uncomfortable arrangement with the daughter of a Vulgarian duchess.  The father of the bride to be, rather ashamed at having an illegitimate son of a priest as a son-in-law, rather took things into his own hands, and through bribes of the local elector, had the lad dubbed Earl of Rumpwhistle.  At the time, the Rumpwhistle lands consisted of a small sheep farm, and a coal seam that had never delivered.  Immediately following the wedding, however, the church lands eschewed to the new Earl, making him a rather large and prominent landowner, and all of a sudden, the envy of his Balkanian neighbors.Over the next three hundred years, war upon war hardened the little kingdom of sheep herders and coal miners into a political nut that was hard to crack.  The line of Earls sure had its fair share of loonies (some would say more than its fair share), but the various barons and mayors under the Earls did a pretty good job of keeping the various baronies and royal cities in line.  Several wars, especially, in the 16th and 17th century, fought over church rights, succession to the Rumpwhistle Throne, the ongoing question of the Ethnic Urbs (noisome people who live in the Carfathian Mountains, and the Karzstan Mountains, between Rumpwhistle and her southern neighbor, the Margravate of Furstenberg) and finally the Vainglorious Revolution fought in the 1680s.That last war, was an internal civil war, between the noble families (many of whom were herd land owners, but some were also urban traders in coal oil and root vegetables) and the democratic body known as the Landhouse.  It seemed that the people at large (stirred up by religious zealots and free-land herders - their motto was \"sheep are sheep\") wanted a say into the running of court.  Especially in the restrictions on use of powdered wigs, silk stockings, lace covered cuffs, and high heeled shoes for men.  The nobles were having none of it.  So a civil war broke out, between the ancien regime of the nobles on one hand (the Earl and his followers were brought into this faction), and the Landhouse leaders, religious rabble, and populists on the other side.  The war raged for a couple of months in late 1682, on into the spring and summer of 1683, but as these things often do, it petered out once the fall skittles season opened up again.  The nobles, eager to get back to their skittle greens, hastily signed a peace with the Landhouse, and even forced the Earl to ratify the Treaty of Confederation, signed in the golden Dome of Man, the great house in the city of Ramshorn where the Landhouse meets.The Treaty of Confederation raised the various baronies and independent cities into Cantons.  Each having an equal vote for the two year office of Premier of the Landhouse, and each providing sitting Consuls for the Landhouse.  The treaty allows the method of election, both of Electors for the Premier and also of Consuls, up to the Cantons.  And in all internal matters the Cantons have free reign, save a common currency, and common observance of the practices of the Reformed church of Balkania, Nikovena Synod.  The matters relating to the currency, as well as to the organization of the common Confederacy Army, which the cantons all contribute funds and men towards, are handled from Ramshorn at the Dome of Man.In the early 18th century, when Northern Furstenberg was embroiled in the War of Pumpkin-King Succession, the new Cantons of the Confederacy of Rumpwhistle were too involved in their own natal state matters to get involved, other than some of the Cantons sending volunteer regiments to assist this side or that side (either the Grand Duchy of Poppenheim or the Principality of Bombastia).In the early 19th century, the Cantons provided troops to various factions to the waging of the Napoleonic Wars in Balkania.  By the middle of the century, economic pressure had pushed Furstenberg and Rumpwhistle into competition again, and a military buildup ensued on both sides of the border."},
{"title": "19th Century Imaginations - the Twenty Three Weeks War", "date": "Friday, March 8, 2013", "text": "So, having begun the basing of my old 28mm ACW figures, re-purposed for a Balkanian campaign, I figured it was time to share my fevered vision of a history of a small brush war in Balkania.This is the history of the 23 Weeks War, a war fought between the Autumn of 1871 and the Spring of 1872.  It involved the forces of Furstenberg (a small enlightened aristocracy) and Rumpwhistle (a small state of confederated cantons), fighting with each other over (nominally) the rights of the Ethnic Urbs (local ethnic tribes living in the mountains straddling the border between the two nations).The problems, as they almost always do, began with disgruntled students.  The Protectorate of Graatz, having been granted to the Margravate of Furstenberg as part of the Edict of Boomplatz peace (see history of Furstenberg), had grown and matured in the two centuries under Furstenberg protection.  A university on the lovely Dukon River (see map of Furstenberg) had grown up, the University of Graatz, located in the city of Alf-Dukon.  The students there, always looking for a way out of their academic duties, sensed weakness following the short War of Disdain (1868-69) between the Confederated Cantons of Rumpwhistle, and the revolting Karzstan Mountain Urbs.  The Urbs were subjugated, but there was concern on the Furstenberg side of the border at Rumpwhistle mobilization.In the late summer of 1871, the students of Graatz University decided that they would not have a regular academic year.  So once school started, they began rioting, demonstrating, publishing pamphlets, and protesting the treatment of the Ethnic Urbs, and the heavy handed action by Rumpwhistle in the Karzstan Mountains.  This came to a head in September of 1871, when the visiting Prince of the Rumpwhistle Throne (a purely decorative figurehead position, ever since the Confederated Cantons established their independence in the early 18th century) was assassinated on a diplomatic visit to Alf-Dukon.  Whether it was by an Urb mountain sharpshooter, or by an instigating student, war was quickly declared by both sides (the Rumpwhistle Confederation in order to save face, and the Furstenbergers in order to not be outdone).The fight took place mostly in the rough country of the northern slopes of the Karzstan Mountains, on the Rumpwhistle side of the border (in the Rumpwhistle canton of Nikovena).  This was a war for infantry, mainly, and involved a lot of local units on both sides, including irregulars and sharpshooters.Painting showing the battle of Papaschlemo, in Nikovena, from 1542 - this is indicative of the terrain fought over in the 23 Weeks WarFor the fight, I am working on a modified set of ACW rules (the Rumpwhistle troops are amazingly close to Confederates, and the Furstenberg Infantry are amazingly similar to US regular army).  I am also planning on an article concerning the Rumpwhistle forces, and the Furstenberg forces, involve din the war.  On the Furstenberg side, it was mostly elements of the Second Army, Fourth Corps, but some interesting local color was involved."},

{"title": "Theremin Thursdays - Gaming in the Viking Age", "date": "Friday, February 22, 2013", "text": "While there are possibly a few different pieces of music that would be appropriate for this theme, one of my favorites is Steve McDonald's \"Sons of Somerled\".This is telling the story of Somerled, who was a ruler of the Kingdom of the Isles (gaining parts, through marriage and conquest, until he ruled everything from the Island of Lewis to the Isle of Man) in the 12th century.  His name (Somerled, or Somairle) is from a Norse word meaning \"Summer Traveler\".  A Summer Traveler, to the Norse, was one who did his \"business trips\" in the summer months - a Viking.On one of his other albums, Steve McDonald has another song, called Seawulf.  Here are the lyrics (another great song).In the long-boats Seawulf came,Crying out the War god's name,Highlander, raise your warning fire,Seawulf's on his way,To feed the battle-crow's desire today.Isle of Man and Isle Tiree,Faced Odin's giants of Valkyre,Gaining control of Argyle,The western highlands too,Somerled has delivered us from you;Seawulf will riseOh, oh, oh, oh, oohOh, oh, oh, oh, oohViking child, oh Viking child, oh Viking child,Who will tame the wolf behind your smile...Viking childViking child, so free and so wild,Tell me why do you roam,Battle on, the Seawulf in search of home. (A lot of oh-oh's in the middle, but a good song nevertheless).  Again, from the same period (late dark ages, during the times when men of the north were raiding and setting up kingdoms in the coastal regions of Scotland, the Isles, England and Ireland).  As far as gaming in this time period goes, there are a lot of different \"collection\" games of medieval and dark ages battles (based on the old SPI idea of a Quad wargame - one set of core rules, with a number of different scenarios, each with a different map and counters, and different special rules).  But there are also a fair number of games that deal with the Norse world in general, and Viking ideas and ideals in particular.One that has fantastic artwork and production values, but the theme could have been just about anything related to economic competition, the game Vikings is one I own and enjoy playing.  Sadly, there is little or nothing involving conquest, raids, or combat in this game.  It is a Michael Kiesling game, and (as I mentioned already) one I find very enjoyable to play.Another game about this time period, but one more in line with what the Vikings themselves thought about the world, and their own destiny, is the old TSR minigame, Saga.  I have a copy of this game, and although I haven't played it in years, I used to play it quite a lot, in high school with my two brothers, and later on with gaming buddies.  A great game - you begin as a hero, and have to travel the Norse world, dealing with creatures and foes (both mortal and from myth), slay monsters and dragons, fight trolls and berserkers, gain a named (magic) sword, and construct a Saga about yourself.  Great game.  Text from the box, reads like this - \"Saga minigame recreates a mythical time period occuring sometime after the fall of Rome - the age of heroes and vikings!  Each player takes a heroic figure and attempts to perform deeds that will generate enough glory to ensure that the hero's memory will live in the sagas composed after his or her death. To gain glory, the heros slay monsters, accumulate treasure hoards, recruit lesser heros (\"jarls\", or earls) as their companions, and establish kingdoms.  The hero who gains the most glory is the one whose fame will live on in the sagas, while the others are doomed to be forgotten by posterity.  Each player must be decisive and alert to grasp chances and avoid having other heroes gain glory at his or her expense.\"Those were the days.  At that time (around 1980) TSR was riding high on HUGE success from AD&D, and they wanted to get into the hot Sci-Fi/Fantasy microgame market (made successful by companies like Metagaming and Task Force Games).Two other microgames come to mind in this theme.  First is the great game from Metagaming, Fury of the Norsemen.  This was one of their historical micros, and although it isn't a phenomenal design, it was pretty solid for its size, and I really enjoyed playing it.  The cover art, and the rulebook art, was atrocious.  It was a bad pastiche of Frank Frazetta barbarian artwork (which I DO enjoy, but which is NOT historical).  The counter art was, on the other hand, really good.  The map, well, it was a map.  Here is a picture of a setup for the game - Monks, women, livestock - in the backfield lots of peasant soldiery.  And out of the mists, on the shoreline, appears a Dragon Ship.The other title was the microgame \"Viking Gods\" by TSR. This one had a really good looking map, and represented a battle at the end of time (Ragnarok) between the Gods and the Giants (and other evil aligned personages - like Loki).  Great little game, but horrible game balance.  True to the sagas, and myth, Good loses this battle.  But it is fun to play.Mentioned are the fact that there are several games that are basically a single set of core rules with a lot of different scenarios, or battles, included that play off that base set of rules.  These games often, to me, feel ALMOST like a set of miniature rules, but with the action taking place on the map.  One of the best, and one that is available in multiple different versions, is William Banks' design, Ancients.  Ancients is currently available from Victory Point Games in a very nice professional version.  But it is also available online, as a free download. Pictured here is the Vassal Module, but the game, in some of its versions, looks quite good - especially the counters from Victory Point Games.  There are some definite Viking age battles including in the massive list of scenarios, including Clontarf, Ashdown, and Hastings (pictured above).  These are all good, solid Dark Ages battles, and certainly in the feel of anyone who wants to roll dice, hear the clang of the battle axe, and sing to Odin while playing the game.An older game, that is based on a set of core rules, and then expanded with optional rules, is the game Viking, in the PRESTAGs series of games from SPI.  It was billed as \"Tactical Warfare in the Dark Ages\" but as it covered 700AD to 1300AD, I think that most historians would call this the end of the Dark Ages, and the Early Middle Ages (if not also the period of Chivalry).  The scenarios included with Viking were impressive, here is a list... Qadisiya (Persians vs. Arabs, AD 637) Tours (Arabs vs. Franks, AD 732) Constantinople (Byzantines vs. Varangians, AD 860) Paris (Vikings vs. Franks, AD 885) Lourain (Franks vs. Vikings, AD 891) Hamburg (Vikings vs. Germans, AD 988) Balthusta (Byzantines vs. Bulgars, AD 1014) Clontarf (Vikings vs. Irish, AD 1014) Cannae II (Byzantines vs. Lombards, AD 1017) Civitate (Normans vs. Papists, AD 1053) Cerami (Normans vs. Arabs, AD 1063) Stamford Bridge (Anglo-Saxons vs. Vikings, AD 1066) Hastings (Normans vs. Anglo-Saxons, AD 1066) Manzikert (Byzantines vs. Seljuq Turks, AD 1071) Durazzo (Byzantines vs. Normans, AD 1082) Dorylaeum (Crusaders vs. Seljuq Turks, 1097) Hattin (Crusaders vs. Moslems, AD 1187) Liegnitz (Mongols vs. Germans, AD 1241) El Mansura (French vs. Arabs, AD 1250)The front cover has a great picture of the metal statue of Leif Erikson, the real statue of which is in front of the beautiful, and very informative, Mariner's Museum, in Newport News Virginia (one of my favorite haunts, especially their historical Naval library).The box cover from SPIThe fantastic statue from the Mariner's MuseumBack in the 1980s, the great Cry Havoc series of tactical Medieval and Dark Ages battles include a volume dedicated to Norsemen and their fights.  It was called Viking Raiders, and was a pretty good addition to that series - including, amongst other things, pieces for Longships, so that naval fights (which were basically infantry fights, but on floating platforms) could be accomplished in the game.  Fun series.No discussion of games about Vikings would be complete without mention of the Game Of the Vikings, Hnefatafl, or \"The King's Board\".  It is an abstract game, where one player plays a King and his huscarls, and the other player plays an army trying to kill the King.  Very exciting game, and loads of fun, even in the 21st century.  Here is a picture of a handmade set, made by the Father and Grandfather of Boardgame Geek member, Jerzy Brzozowski, from Brazil.Of course, Diplomacy and its many variants was not free from Dark Ages efforts.  Two that stand out, are Heptarchy and Bretwalda, both by Geoff Bache.  The first is set from about 650AD, and the second about 30 years earlier, in 620AD.  Both feature the British Isles in the early Dark Ages, when there were competing kingdoms. at war.  Here is the map for Heptarchy, which is very nice.And here is the map for Bretwalda (which, by the way, is the word for High King).  As mentioned, both of these are by Geoff Bache, who just wanted to have Diplomacy games based on territory he was familiar with.Some years ago, I ran a Hordes of the Things (fantasy miniatures rules, based on DBA) campaign based on the Bretwalda map.  There was also a Dragon moving around (eating troops, at random); a Sea Wyrm, moving around sinking fleets, and Merlin (wandering around, making peace, and halting wars).  A fun game, although there were some player incompatibility problems (mostly personality).There is also a variant called Viking Diplomacy, which is a nice overview of the period that most of this article is concerned with (9th-11th century, northern British Isles).  But it covers all of Western Europe, to even include North Africa (can't ignore the possibility of Norsemen battling it out with Moors).These days, in miniatures however I really like the (now out of production) ruleset Warhammer Ancient Battles.  Although there are problems with the series (in print? out of print?) there were some books that were put out, as period supporting books, with lots of info on miniatures, army lists, painting, history, and scenarios in them.The first is the Age of Arthur (written by Steven Jones and James Morris) which covers that period in the Dark Ages (approx 6th century) when many surmise that a historical Arthur lived.  It is set in the early Dark Ages, and the armies are just right for the region and period covered in this article.  The army lists from this book cover the span from 400AD to 800AD.  The armies covered are these:The Romano-British Civitates       - including the armies of Vortigern, Ambrosius and the Bretons.The British and Welsh Kingdoms       - including the kingdoms of Gododdin, Gwynedd, Strathclyde and Dumnonia.The Saxons       - including Saxon raiders as well as the kingdoms of the Heptarchy.The Franks       - the armies of the early Merovingians.The Picts       - including the Northern and Southern Picts, and the enigmatic Attecotti.The Scots-Irish       - including Irish raiders and the kingdoms of Dalriada and Ireland.It should be mentioned that in addition to the history and the great army lists, both this book (and the next one) offer a number of very, very good scenarios that are a lot of fun to read and to play, as well as a number of different campaign ideas.  And the pictures (both black and white, and color photos of painted miniatures) are very evocative, and extremely nicely done.The second Warhammer Ancient Battles book that I will mention here is Shieldwall, which is more appropriately themed for the Viking age.  Written by Stephen Patten, this is an excellent wargamer's guide.  It has army lists (in detail) for the following:Kingdoms of the North (Armies of the Danish and Danelaw, Norwegian, Dublin-Norse, Orkneyinga, and Islemen)Kingdoms of English (Saxon armies of Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria, Anglia, Kent and Sussex)Kingdoms of Caledonia (Armies of Dal Riata, the Pictish Lands, Strathclyde, Alba and Scotland)Kingdoms of the Welsh (Armies of Gwynneth, Powys, Dumnonia, and the South Welsh Kingdoms)Kingdoms of Hibernia (Armies of Connacht, Munster, Ulster, and Leinster)Western Franks (Kingdoms of Normandy, Brittany, Flanders and France - the Normans)   An excellent gamer's resource, for the history, army lists, background reading, and scenarios.  Even if you don't play Warhammer Ancient Battles.A really nice photo of some painted figures from the period is here, and it comes from Kevs Wargames blog. My own miniatures for this period include a vast assortment of painted 15mm figures covering lots of Dark Ages armies.  I also have a really large collection of 28mm figures.  Many of which are painted, but I have a whole project awaiting my attention - half of it in the really nice Somerled line from Old Glory, and the other half of it in Wargames Factory plastic Viking figures.  I am really looking forward to painting the Old Glory figures, and the Plastics give lots of kitbash and individualizing possibilities. Finally, a few last music pieces to end the article with.  The first is the theme song from the Richard Widmark movie, The Long Ships.  Which also features Sidney Poitier and the Mare of Steel!More fun for me, however, was the movie The Vikings, staring Ernest Borgnine and Kirk Douglas.  This was a GREAT movie, and didn't have \"the mare of steel\" (who's idea was that, anyway?). HAIL RAGNAR!!And finally, the modern epic of the Viking Age, none other than Eric the Viking.  Enjoy!  This is not the soundtrack, which is elusive, but it is the trailer of the movie.  Highlighting just how good (bad?) this movie is.  But it has a cast of thousands (Eartha Kitt?  In a Viking movie?), and is really fun to watch.  At least once.Thanks, and I hope you get a chance to enjoy some gaming in the Viking World!"},
{"title": "Wargaming Review: \"Wargaming Nineteenth Century Europe 1815-1878\"", "date": "Wednesday, February 20, 2013", "text": "I am a fan of the rules from Neil Thomas.  I have his earlier books, and recently acquired his newest publication, Wargaming Nineteenth Century Europe 1815-1878.First, I'll say that the rules are similar to his earlier publications (Wargaming, An Introduction; Ancient and Medieval Wargaming; and Napoleonic Wargaming).  Second, I'll say that I like these rules, and this time out is no exception.  For a nice basic review of the rules, take a look at Jonathan Freitag's Palouse Wargaming Journal.One of the things in the rules that I really like is how Thomas has handled the army lists, and scenarios, this time out.  First of all, he covers a lot of conflicts from the period of interest.  And rather than doing generic army lists (except in a very few cases, such as Revolutionary Army 1815-1848, which represents a number of forces for which, in this particular case, there is very little documentation), Thomas provides us with paired opponents (or several armies) from individual conflicts, or campaigns.Additionally, rather than laying out a basic army list that is good for all uses, he instead just details what the different categories (in general, these are Infanty, Cavalry, Skirmishers, and Artillery) are for the different armies.  Each army has one or more troop types for each of these categories, or some reason as to why it is not represented (for instance, in the Crimean War lists, the Russian army does not get any skirmishers; instead, the would get artillery units replacing skirmishers).Finally, the third thing concerning armies and scenarios is that each scenario gives a method for determing a number of units, for each side in the scenario, that correspond to Thomas' basic categories that he has provided.  So, for instance, a number of Infantry, Skirmishers, Cavalry and Artillery might be generated for side \"A\" in a scenario, and these would then be replaced by the units matching that category for the army being used for side \"A\".  This allows the scenarios (which are pretty general, but still quite interesting) to be used for all of the conflicts, and for participant armies to take either side.Some examles: For the Franco-Austrian war of 1859, the French Army has:Line Infantry (Average, Rifled Musket, Loose Order)Chasseurs (Elite, Rifled Musket, Loose Order)Skirmishers (Elite, Rifled Musket)French Cavalry (Average)Piedmontese Cavalry (Elite)Artillery (Smoothbore)So we have the Infantry Category covered (Line Infantry, and Chasseurs), the Skirmishers, the Cavalry (both French and Piedmontese), and the Artillery.  Then there are some special rules that go along with it -Infantry - When Infantry units are called for, 1-2 of them will be Chasseurs, and the remainder will be Line Infantry.Cavalry - When Cavalry units are called for, 0-1 of them will be Piedmontese, and the remainder will be French.Infantry Elan - Infantry always charge their counterparts, even if they have fewer bases.Rifled Artillery -  0-1 units of artillery have Bronze Rifled guns, rather than Smoothbore.Command Level - Average.Broken Terrain - All units in open terrain have a saving roll of 5-6 when shot at.This gives a good representation of the French Army for this conflict.  There is also a similar treatment for the Austrians (different composition, and different special rules).So, lets say we are using this army for Scenario #1 in the rulebook (pp. 51-54).  The player, having determined (by dice toss) if he is on offense or defense, would then roll 1d6, and consult the table in the book, determining how many units of each category he has.  Let's say, for example, that the player rolls a \"2\".  This means that his army will get 4 units of infantry, 2 units of skirmishers, 2 units of cavalry, and 2 units of artillery.  For this army this means -The army will (50/50 chance) either have 2 units of Chasseurs and 2 units of Line, or 1 unit of Chasseurs and 3 units of line.  The army will have 2 units of Skirmishers.  The army will have (50/50) either 1 unit of Piedmontese and 1 unit of French Cavalry, or no Piedmontese and 2 units of French Cavalry.  Finally, the army will have (50/50) 1 Bronze Rifled Gun section and 1 Smoothbore section, or 2 Smoothbore sections. So, the simple system of generic scenarios, with force level determination, along with army lists detailing the contents (and special contents) of each of the basic categories, gives some really nice scenario driven wargaming results.  Hats off to you Neil Thomas - I already plan to \"steal\" the system for a game design I am working on.Gygax Magazine.  Now available for Subscription.  And I did."},

{"title": "Cold War Wargaming - Theremin Thursdays", "date": "Thursday, February 7, 2013", "text": "It has been a while since I got to write about Gaming and Music.  Today's topic is the Cold War.  Specifically, the Soviet Union, and military actions in the cold war.First, as a great library of song titles from the Cold War, I could do no better than the list already at the \"In the 80s\" website.  They list just about everything, and give a brief description about what makes the song a Cold Wars song.For my musical contribution today, however, I would like to point to a great little piece from the movie \"The Hunt for Red October\".  The movie, by the way, is an excellent Cold War tale, based on the terrific novel by Tom Clancey.  In brief it is about a Submarine Captain (Captain Marko Ramius, the Vilnius Schoolmaster) in the Soviet Navy that wants to defect, and the CIA analyst (hero Jack Ryan) who figures it out, and then has to convince the US/NATO side to allow the Soviet Captain the leeway to try it.  Good stuff, very tense, and lots of background material about the political and military situation of the cold war.  The fact that the Soviet Captain is played by Sean Connery.The musical piece, from the soundtrack of the movie, is \"The Hymn of the Red October\", which is track 5 on the soundtrack.The soundtrack is credited to Basil Poledouris (a favorite here at Gaming with Chuck HQ).  He was mentioned, prominently, in an earlier Theremin Thursdays article, for his fine work on the Conan the Barbarian movie.The song \"Hymn of the Red October\" was made up for the movie, but it certainly sounds like a lot of Soviet martial music.  A lot of that music is very, very good - for military music.  Readers take notice: my admiration of the music, in no way extends to admiration for any of the horrors and atrocities committed during the Soviet era.  Much of the history of that state fascinates, but it also detests.Another example of some fine (real world) Soviet era military music is the song \"Invincible and Legendary - Glory to the Soviet Army\" - here is a link to a version that I think is by the Red Army Choir.For anyone interested, there is a LOT of music from the former Soviet Union, as well as pop music from both sides of the Iron Curtain, that detail the mood and feelings of the Cold War.  One that I have to mention, because I was such a fan at the time, is from the German performer Gabriele Susanne Kerner, performed in the group called Nena.There was a strong anti-military and anti-cold war, and even anti-NATO (and anti-US) movement in central Europe in the 80s. Politically one of the chief proponents was the Greens Party in West Germany (Sonstige Politische Vereinigung, Die Grünen).  They are even mentioned as setting the stage for the events in the cold war movie, \"Red Dawn\".  In that setting - with an environmentalist party appealing to the young, and also an anti war movement - songs like 99 luftballons were popular.  Here is a link to the song. (by the way, Nena did an English version of the song.  It doesn't work as well, in my opinion).I recall at the time this came out, I was a college student at Christopher Newport College, in Newport News Virginia.  I was also a very active gamer at Campaign Headquarters in Hampton, Virginia (later moved to Newport News).  At the time, one of my chief interests was Cold War land actions.  This included a lot of the regional conflicts between super-power backed client states.  This included some of the brush wars in Africa; potential regional power conflicts, like India vs. Pakistan; and of course all the Middle East conflicts featuring Israel vs. a cast of thousands.  All of these had implications for the Cold War, and I think my fascination with the military and political situation was my response to the horrible situation of being 2 minutes from midnight on the Nuclear clock.  It was an interesting time.As far as wargaming goes, I was playing with several different miniatures rule sets, mainly home brew and the games for Modern conflict from Wargames Research Group.  In 1988, however, Tabletop Games released Challenger II - and that became our favorite rules to play.  Looking back, they are overly fiddly and detailed, at least by the fashions of today, and they have a overly complex and long turn sequence.  But at the time we loved it.  All of us were fascinated with everything and anything about the military situation of the NATO and Warsaw Pact forces, so we were steeped deep in technical details, doctrine details, reports of regional conflicts, and specs on new equipment that was spotted and reported on in Jane's Defense Weekly.  Because of that, we THRIVED on the detail of the game.The rules were backed up by a series of publications from Tabletop Games that dealt with specifications on all the equipment from all the world's armies, as well as new and speculative equipment descriptions.  These came out in Army List books, Digests, and Supplements.  I still have some of these, they are incredible sources of detailed information.  The Army List books have all sorts of ORBAT information on the different formations of the different branches and deployment configurations of the world's military organizations.  The Digests (which describe equipment) gave detailed shopping lists of all the pertinent systems that are included on each vehicle platform, as well as information on the Infantry and Aircraft weapon systems in use.There were times when we would dip back into the WRG rules, or play around with Homebrew rules. Of particular note were the many Warlords games ran by Dan Conley, using early precursors to his popular Quickfire rules. The Warlords games were set some time after the 4th world war, with local Warlords in the nuclear blasted wasteland assembling small armies of WW2 and Modern equipment, and going to battle with each other over ruined cities, military bases, and other sites of potential salvage value.  Lots of fun.Fast forward to today.  As I mentioned, the older rules are definitely not in the style that many gamers prefer today.  One set of rules that really captures a modern feel - meaning that it is not too detailed, not too chart heavy, has an innovative and fun way to play and control turn sequencing and C2 (command and control), but gives a rewarding game with good results in spite of detail being abstracted away - is the set of rules called Cold War Commander.  They are by Peter Jones, and published by his company Specialist Military Publishing.At the time of my writing this, I think that SMP are sold out of physical copies of the book, but you can order a PDF from them, or order a physical copy printed by Lulu. The rules are great, and are a real pleasure to play, and they are also self contained - they include everything you need to know in order to play conflicts from the 1950s on up through tomorrow - with loads and loads of army lists.  All of the regional conflicts that we watched and were interested in during the 60s, 70s, 80s, etc are all covered, as well as extensive coverage of all the \"potential\" participants in a WWIII scenario that could have happened during the Cold War.  A nice review of the rules, and contents, is on Youtube by TheTableTopGamer - a nice 19 year old wargamer from the UK.I have several miniature armies for this era, that are usable with the Cold War Commander rules.  I try to collect them in pairs, so I have some Israeli and generic Arabs (that could be Syrians, Egyptians, etc).  For those conflicts I really favor 1967 and 1973.  I have some second and third tier NATO equipment, and an equivalent set of Warsaw Pact equipment.  This allows me to do fun things like Poland vs. Belgium in 1989, and so on.The key feature of the game is that there is a dice and decision driven Command and Control structure.  Your army will feature a hierarchy of commanders of different elements, and each has a command value, representing a number from 2 to 12.  A very good commander would be rated a 9 or 10.  Players will identify a commander, roll 2d6, and if successful be able to issue orders to units under control of that commander.  Orders are basically move, or shoot, or move AND shoot. If you pass your test, then after your order is carried out, you can roll to do it again, but with a negative dice modifier.  When you first miss your dice test, then that commander is over for the turn.There is a lot more to the rules, but for me that is the heart of the game.  It is very similar to the sister publications from SMP - Blitzkrieg Commander (covering WW2), and Future War Commander (covering a wide variety of Science Fiction settings).  The command and control rules in all of these are very similar to, and are rumored to be borrowed from (by Peter Jones, and with permission and blessing) the Warmaster series of Fantasy and Historical (Ancients and Medievals) rules by Rick Priestley.Some of Rick's more recent efforts (such as Blackpowder for battles from 1700-1900; and others, such as Hail Caesar also from Warlord Games) have a modified version of the same structure.  In this modern version, you make one dice toss for your commander, and depending on how well it is passed, that determines (ahead of time) how many actions the command will have.  Very useful.  Takes out some of the guessworks, So, all told, this is a very nice family of wargames.  In the words of the Vilnius Schoolmaster (Captain Marko Ramius), \"Shplendid\"."},
{"title": "Comparison of Ticket To Ride variants", "date": "Wednesday, February 6, 2013", "text": "The following is an excerpt of a letter I wrote to a friend comparing the various Ticket to Ride variants.  The official ones, anyway.  I thought other people would find it useful.Ok, here is the rundown.  The dice add on, as I said, makes for a different, faster, but still enjoyable game.  We like it a lot, but it does feel different from regular TTR.Both the Nordic Countries and the Switzerland alternative are loads of fun, especially for small groups.  They are both designed for only 2 or 3 players.  Both incorporate rules for tunnels, and Nordic Countries has rules for Ferries.  Very simple rule changes, but fun. Tunnels are specially marked train routes that may require extra cards to build them. It is random (you draw three extra cards every time you build a tunnel; if any match the color you are building, it means you need an extra card).  The effect on play is that it is a little risky to build a tunnel route, unless you have collected a few extra cards of that color.  We find it to be a nice rule addition.  Ferries are routes that require either one or two of your cards to be locomotives. Also a fun addition.  The maps themselves also have differences.In Nordic Countries, the map has lots of short routes in the southwest, and lots of long routes in the north east.  It means that depending on the tickets you select, your strategy will be different.  In Switzerland, almost all of the tickets are easy, and short, and you tend to complete a LOT of tickets.  Scores can run high in Switzerland. Both are lots of fun and we (Anita, my wife, and Heidi, our daughter) like them.  Nordic Countries also has a Christmas-y feel to he artwork, so we often pull it out to play over Christmas break.There is a Europe version, that is great for family play.  He reason is that it allows you to build a Station if you like, on a city.  It has the effect of allowing you to use a route that was claimed by another player, so being cut off is not as disastrous as in the other versions of the game.  It really is only important for larger games, or games where one or more of the players are somewhat aggressive.  The tickets for Europe are much more evenly spread out than the base game.  Europe also incorporates tunnels and ferries.There is a Legendary Asia version, that features a map stretching from the Ukraine to Japan, and from Siberia to India.  It is a lovely map, and the tickets are the most spread out and even of all the variants.  It features Ferries, and Mountain Passes.  The latter require you to discard a train piece every time you build one.  Those discarded pieces are worth 2 points each at the end of each turn, and they have the effect on the game of making the many short routes in the higher population areas of the map as being worth a decent amount more than the regular 2 or 4 points they would be in other versions.  It is a very fun version and has a great feel to it, but less player interaction (like racing to complete a route) because of how evenly placed the tickets are.There is a Team Asia version (the map focuses on China) that allows you to play as teams, possibly including a Sixth player.  You can also play without teams, but the team rules look interesting. Each player has their own train cards, plus train cards that belong to the team. Team mates are not allowed to share info about what they plan to do, and can't show each other their non team cards.  Looks interesting, but we haven't played the team version.There is an India version that just is a different board, but one that is a lot of fun to play. It gives bonus points for completing tickets using two or more different paths. Very interesting feel, and a bit more competitive than other versions.There is a Germany version called Märklin. Märklin is a German manufacturer of model trains, and they sponsored this one. Every train card has a picture of a different model train car on it of the right color.  The map has Passenger markers on it at the beginning of the game, and a player may choose to collect all the markers on a train route instead of a regular play.  Knowing when and if to do that adds another level of decision making to the game.  I love this version, but Anita and Heidi have said it is the hardest to play, and quite competitive.  I love the cards because I love railroading history, so maybe that clouds my judgement!There is a Heart of Africa version, that has special cards allowing you to multiply your points for jungle, mountain, or desert train routes. I have not played it, but it looks beautiful (the map and the cards).These are the official map board variants.  Switzerland and India come packaged together.  Legendary Asia and Team Asia come packaged together.  Africa comes alone in a box.  Europe and Märklin and Nordic Countries all come packaged alone, and they each include basic pieces (plastic trains and train cards).  The others only have rules and ticket cards, so require a basic set to play.Other than the variant map boards, there are four other add ons. First, already mentioned, are the Dice, which work with any variant, but building the special 9-car ferry in Nordic Countries would be very hard using the dice system.Another (Excellent) add on is the 1910 box.  It has very nice full sized train and ticket cards for the North America game (I really don't like the little cards, they are fiddly and hard to shuffle).  It also includes a number of variant ticket cards hat each give the basic game a very different feel.  For a small add on it really improves the game experience (better cards) and gives lots of different game play alternatives.Europe has a similar boxed add on called 1912.  I also adds extra tickets for Europe (the Europe base game comes with larger cards, they learned their lesson after the first set), and another variant.  This is the Warehouse, which is a way to collect extra cards that come in handy.There is also the Alvin and Dexter add on.  Alvin the alien and Dexter the dinosaur are plastic pieces that move around and block cities from being developed.

{"title": "Units, Environment, Movement, Weapons - City States of Aquaria", "date": "Wednesday, January 16, 2013", "text": "So, I have been pretty busy since I first got the idea, and started sketching out particulars, for the \"City States of Aquaria\" game.  Here is a rundown of my progress.  I even got some materials to make playtest counters and a map, but then things got REALLY busy in my real life, so it is creeping along.Environment - The environment of the game is a science fiction setting - the battles that take place between various techno-feudal city states on a water planet.  These city states have large domed underwater cities, with underwater industry, robo-farming, manufacturing and resource extraction.  High speed movement between these domed cities is by tube train, and there are all manner of craft designed to navigate the depths below, surface, and atmosphere above the shallow seas of the world.  Man has even adapted to living and moving around underwater pretty easily.Klaus Bürgle: City under the Sea*   In wargaming terms, this means that the action will take place on a hex map showing the sub-aqua terrain.  In the game, within a hex, units can be at 5 different heights.  Ocean floor, low ocean, mid ocean, high ocean, and Surface.  Underwater topography (hills, plateaus) will be in one of three different levels, sort of like the \"wedding cake\" hills of table top miniature gaming, or of the older BattleTech maps.  Each level (low, mid, high) will correspond to one of the ocean levels.Units will be able to move about in the water, although some units will be tied to either the bottom, or the surface.Movement - Each type of unit will have a basic movement allowance.  This is, generally speaking, expended to move through the hexes on the map.  Units that can change levels on their own (i.e. - not those tied to the ocean floor, or to the surface) can also expend points of their movement allowance to change levels.  In general, a movement point is spent to move one hex, or to change one level.  The moving unit must move laterally (on it's own level) one hex, before changing levels, and must make a lateral move between each level change.  The exception to this is that if the unit ONLY wants to change levels, then it can expend it's entire movement allowance to go up or down 1 level, while remaining in the same hex.Units - As mentioned in the earlier post the types of units are basically four categories.  Those are:Floor Units, which move around mainly on the ocean floor.  This includes Infantry, Armor, and Artillery.Ocean Craft, which includes different sized man-made submersible craft, up to and including massive multi-weapon system craft.  Units include Aqua-Jets (small two man fighters), Stingrays, Aqua-Cruisers, Leviathans and Leviathan-Hunters. Biologicals, which includes various animal types that have been modified for combat, and are controlled and directed by a human telepath.  These include the semi-intelligent sea mammals of Aquaria, the Cetas, Orcas, and Megas.  Also, the enormous monsters from the depths, the Behemoth, the Kraken, and the Gargantua.Surface Units, which include large surface units, and a variety of atmospheric fast movers.  Units include Surface Control Ships, Attack Hovers, and Assault Hovers.Weapons - Most of the Ocean Craft (except for the Aqua-Jets and the Stingrays) mount multiple weapons, the choice of which (depending on the scenario) will be up to the player to choose.  Most weapons will have a chance to destroy just about any unit from one shot (if it is successful), but the larger monstrous biologicals (Behemoth, Kraken, and Gargantua), as well as the larger ocean craft (Leviathans and Leviathan Hunters) have a much harder time of being destroyed from a single hit (although it is possible, just very rare).  Instead, hits against them destroy capabilities (weapon mounts).I have basic stats on almost all of these units, and I'll try to get it posted for next week's Wargaming Wednesdays, here at Gaming with Chuck.This is some inspirational video.  There is so much cool stuff going on in this video, I just gotta watch it over and over.  The \"bad guy\" underwater city, at about 15 minutes in is very inspirational.  Also, Hydronic Rockets?

{"title": "City States of Aquaria", "date": "Wednesday, December 26, 2012", "text": "A new project underway at Gaming with Chuck Headquarters - moving slow, and sure to carry into the new year - is a wargame design.  It will be a tactical wargame, set in a science fiction setting.The setting is this - The planet Coralon-VI is a water world, that was settled by a colony ship from Earth, about 600 years ago, during the first wave of Colonial expansion.  As there is not much in the way of free standing land on the surface of Coralon-VI, named Aquaria by the original settlers, a sequence of genetic modifications to the frozen embryos on the colony ship was made, so that starting wih the first batched of locally born colonists, all of the long term inhabitants of Aquaria would be able to breathe and live underwater, in the shallow seas.Thus began the original settlement of the planet.  Underwater cities, as well as modified local plant and animal life, gave rise to the City States of Aquaria.  Now, however, 600 years after first planetfall, the Philosopher-Princes of the various city states have begun to run out of settlement and development space in the choice areas of the shallow seas.  As always in Human history, this has led to a state of war between the city states.The game will be a tactical game between the armed forces of the various city states of Aquaria.  Those forces include not only human warriors, but also undersea craft, surface craft, and cyber-enhanced lifeforms native to the world.  I have worked up basic movement and combat sequences, and am in development of the various units, but here is a preview...Sea Infantry - basic human warriors, adapted to underwater living and combat.Sea Crawlers - armored vehicles, designed to operate on the bottom of the sea, capable of carrying heavy weapons.Warrior Fish - various sized fish, enhanced with weapons and armor, trained to respond to commands and operate in combat.Sub-Craft - underwater attack craft, small and with crews of usually only 1 or 2 humans.Surface-Craft - attack craft that operate on the surface.Destroyers, Cruisers, Leviathans - undersea craft, with large crews, and multiple weapon systems.Terrors and Krakens - modified sea lifeforms that are not fish, but still have been modified to carry a variety of weapons, etc.The game will feature simple rules for movement and combat, as well as close-in combat (melee?).  I have already worked up the basics for these (moving, fighting, shooting), as well as some basic terrain, for the basic units.  I am playing around with turn sequencing, and different C2 structures for the game, either cards or dice or something else.As yesterday was Christmas, it seemed appropriate to send out some Christmas Cheer to fans and readers of Gaming with Chuck.Below is a picture of a Father Christmas (i.e. Santa Claus) figure, painted up quite nicely.  I am not sure, but I believe this was a special release figure from The Foundry.  Anyone know for sure?Be sure to enjoy the time between now and New Years day, and I hope all reading this have a Great New Year, as well.-The Management"},

{"title": "Wargaming Wednesdays - battlefield effects", "date": "Thursday, December 20, 2012", "text": "Sometimes in battles the unexpected happens.  Units perform without orders; reinforcing elements arrive late (or early) ( or not at all); supporting elements don't; and individual officers are often anything but predictable.But how to translate this into a tabletop miniatures game without a lot of complication?  One way is with card driven events.  This is down well in the excellent ruleset, The Sword in Africa.  Also by Patrick Wilson's random event decks for TSATF.  Charles Grant, in his Programmable Wargames Scenarios handles it for the solo wargaming by providing dice driven results for one or both sides in a solo game.  The recent generation of card-driven board wargames handle it by linking events to troop activation.  The ACW ruleset (and it's many variants) Fire and Fury handles it through a maneuver dice table where unpredictable move results can occur.A simple system is suggested here, with fleshed out details next time.Every third turn (3, 6, 9, etc) after all moves and combats are done, both sides roll a dice.  High roller has the whim of fate on his side, temporarily.  If the high roller had an even number, then some benefit accrues to his forces.  If it is an odd number, then something negative happens to his foe.Specific results will be in a future add-on to this posting."},

{"title": "Theremin Thursdays - music of The Hobbit, but not yet", "date": "Friday, December 14, 2012", "text": "Okay fans, so this week as a special request to my daughter, I agreed to think about the music from The Hobbit (different versions) as the theme for considering the relationship between music and gaming.That is pretty broad territory, as The Hobbit has been done as an animated movie, has some great songs in the book, had some songs set to music by Professor Tolkien, and even in some of the various radio and audio versions has had some music appear.  Plus there are songs ABOUT The Hobbit that are not FROM The Hobbit.  And, looming over the shoulder of this conversation is the release of the first installment of the new Peter Jackson trilogy relating the book to the modern cinema.We have a family outing planned to see the movie this weekend, so before I write the full, definitive Gaming with Chuck article on the relationship between The Hobbit, music, and gaming - I will wait until after the movie.In the meantime, as a sort of teaser, here are some music clips....A great song/ballad by Glenn Yarbrough for the Rankin Bass animated film.Another song, also from the RB movie, is this one - sung by Wood Elves after the demise of Smaug...As my one tip of the hat to the new movie, before I see it, I will post a single video that is based on the movie.  By now, even if you haven't seen the flick, you must have seen or heard the incredible trailer that features the scene at that famous party at Bag End, where the Dwarves (deep in their cups) begin getting moody and steamy-eyed and start singing of their long lost heritage and treasures that were lost to the dragon smaug.  The singing from the movie looks and sounds great in that trailer.  There is a vocal group called Str8Voices that does a cover (yes, already) of that song.  It is incredible, except for one thing.  The song really doesn't call for female voices.  See what you think - Amazing enough, there are already some other, even more divergent, versions of this song available.  Like this one (a talented singer, Karliene, but not a Dwarf), and this one (cute, but still not a Dwarf), and this one (that last one is two twins playing electric harps - which they also do on songs from Skyrim, the Legend of Zelda, Blue Oyster Cult, and a cover of an AC/DC song - where will it all end?).  Sheesh.   All good, but not Dwarves.  I like Dwarves. Now Rob Inglis is a Dwarf.  And a Hobbit.  And an Elf.  And one of the Númenóreans.  He is the Most Excellent reader/performer of the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings as recorded books - and he is a complete one man show.  Here he sings \"The Song of the Lonely Mountain\" from the book, which is what all this fuss is over anyway.Okay, that is enough for now.  But... before departing, I do have to offer up One gaming link.  As I have brought up the Dwarves singing about the desolation that Smaug had wrought on their home in the Lonely Mountain, I should cover a game that deals with that topic.  [Yes, there was a great title from Iron Crown Enterprises on this very theme, but I will get to that in the later Hobbit article.]For this installment, I am recalling a game, in a series of boxed micro games from Heritage (great manufacturer of miniatures, a long long time ago - who actually did, for the age, a pretty good line of Lord of the Rings miniatures and rules), called Dragon Rage by the talented Lewis Pulsipher.  The list of games was called Dwarfstar games (currently made available on the website from Brainiac), and included some good titles.Curiously this is the second micro game to appear in a Gaming with Chuck article this week, the earlier one being the excellent Metagaming title, Chitin:I.I think that it could be very easily argued that the basic idea of Dragon Rage owes at least a little to the idea of Smaug's raid on Lake Town.  Here is a link to the game (which has been released by the original copyright holders in a free Print and Play form). The game has recently been re-produced and made available commercially (for those who don't want to print and assemble) by Flatline Games.  It looks really, really good.More on the Hobbit, and gaming, in a few days, after I get a chance to view the Peter Jackson offering.Addendum:  A few weeks ago, in the original Theremin Thursdays article, I had a link to the Peter Hollens and  Lindsey Stirling video featuring Peter's vocals and Lindsey's violin playing in honor of Skyrim.  Well, I just recently came across another fantastic video, featuring some interesting video of everyone's favorite dragonborn hero, but this time with music from the incredibly talented Malukah (see her playlist on youtube, here).  The Guild Wars song that she collaborates on has her doing some really nice vocal work."},
{"title": "Wargame Wednesdays: Chitin:I The Harvest Wars", "date": "Wednesday, December 12, 2012", "text": "A very interesting topic this week.  Actually four mushed together, but only with minor coverage for each (leaving room for future articles in all four topics).  The four ideas are this - Science Fiction board games, Micro Games, Games based on Biology, and Redesigns of old games.  Not that kind of Science Fiction board game.The game covered below is definitely a Science Fiction board game, actually a war game (using a loose definition of a game that conceptually represents two different factions in martial conflict with each other).  It is one of the original batch of Micro Games from the first dedicated publisher in that subgenre.  It is (as you will see) based on Biology (meaning, living units, and the game somehow represents the processes of living units).  And, there is a fantastic modern redesign of the game.The game I am thinking of is Chitin:I (the Harvest Wars), by Howard Thompson, and published by Metagaming way back in 1977 (the Pleistocene era).  It is a very innovative game concept, being built around two hives of intelligent insects that are at war with each other, over food.  It just so happens that dead intelligent insects are an excellent example of food.Each army has several different types of insects (fully realized in the advanced rules) that give different capabilities.  Collecting food is how you score victory conditions, and for that you need workers.  But there are also several different types of warrior bugs (each with different strengths) and also flyers, and brains (called Basics) that give a command capacity to the army.The game came out in the micro game series from Metagaming, meaning it was in a small pocket size, with a small two color map, and a cardboard sheet of counters, and a rulebook.  Originally it was in a plasticene pouch, and the second edition came in a box (with a micro die).  It sold for the unheard of sum of $2.99.  Well, almost unheard of - it was the second game in the series, and the original game was OGRE (I shudder in the awesomeness...) which was in the same format and also sold for $2.99.  Some awesome pictures of the early cover art of both of these (Chitin:I and OGRE) are available at the Microgame Museum, which features data on many of the micrograms (both by Metagaming, and by a host of other companies).Chitin: I is a remarkable amount of fun to play, but other than the conceptual idea (of bugs warring with each other over food), there really isn't too much new in the game.  Some common hex based wargaming ideas are present - zone of control, movement based on hexes, combat based on a Combat Results Table (CRT).  Some of the innovative things the game did offer - The hex map has Mega-hexes (a larger hex, drawn around some smaller hexes) which regulate movement for flying units.  Also, the facing of a unit matters in this game, which is not true of many other games of this era.  And, of course, dead units become victory objectives (actually, they can be harvested by worker units, for victory points).So, we have an excellent, if old, game that may or may not be available as a used game, or through a scanned PDF source.  But that is where the idea of game Redesign comes in.  It seems that there are a number of very talented graphics design people who get a real charge out of taking existing games, and redesigning the components for them (sometimes with new art, or sometimes just to rearrange the components into more useful sizes or shapes).  The redesign of Chitin: I by Scott Everts is fantastic.  There is an article about it here, in Scott's blog on Boardgame Geek.  Here is a picture of the (fantastic) finished product.The new board is fantastic, as are the control charts, and (not pictured) even the game manual.  Scott evidently talked with Paul Jaquays (artist for the original Metagaming game) about redoing the game.  Metagaming itself is long gone, and when he sold the company, after parting ways with Steve Jackson, Howard Thompson (the designer of the game, and the man behind the company) evidently left gaming forever.  Despite numerous attempts by people to get back in touch with him over a number of the old Metagaming designs, he has never shown any interest.  So . . . Scott went to Paul.  Paul was (as described in the article linked to above in Scott's blog) reasonable about letting him have access to the art, and even gave him some new art.  But it didn't work well, being too detailed for the size counters that Scott was doing (note: I love Paul Jaquays art, and always have since his earliest Judges Guild stuff).(side note about Paul - known to old gamers as one of the most influential of the early fantasy game artists, and designer of fantastic products over the years like Central Casting, Paul had moved on to working in the video game industry, on titles such as HaloWars and others.  He recently - maybe 2011 - underwent a sex change process in his life and is now known as Jennell Jaquays which is mentioned here, because any modern lookup of current art projects for the video game world will most likely come up under the name Jennell.  I personally hope that Jennell continues to create, and to prosper as a designer and artist.)A great bio of Jaquays is available from Escapist Magazine.  Anyway, the new art that Scott eventually used was from Nick Hayes.  Nick is a very talented graphic designer that makes all sorts of really interesting an innovative game components.  Here is a list (with pictures) of some of his projects.  As a comparison between the 1977 components and the modern Nick Hayes based stuff from Scott, here are the two counter types. Finally, I should point out that the game, as it exists today, is available in two main forms.  First, you can get the files as downloads through Board Game Geek, and then print them out and assemble them (to as awesome of a level as you like) yourself.  Second, you can purchased a printed version of them from Print and Play Productions, a company that takes print and play (PNP) games from the Geek and other sources and provides professionally made physical components out of them.  Sort of like dealing with Artscow but not having to do the design and upload process yourself.So, no matter how you get a copy, find a copy of Chitin:I and prepare to defend your hive, by eating your aggressive and dangerous (but oh, so tasty) neighbors."},
{"title": "Wargame Wednesdays - Hold the Line", "date": "Wednesday, December 5, 2012", "text": "So, I have been wanting to start writing some reviews of games from Virginia wargaming companies for the past few weeks, and I finally got started on the first - a title from Worthington Games named Hold the Line.HtL is a lightweight wargame that recreates situations from the American Revolutionary War, in the struggle between the Continentals and the British Regulars. It has rules for leaders, different troop types, movement, combat, terrain effects, and a very nice selection of troops.On first glance, a lot of gamers draw comparisons between HtL and Richerd Borg's Command and Colors series - and there are some similarities.  Both are played on a similarly sized (in number of hexes) generic board, using tiles for terrain.  Both involve abstracted troop body markers, that have a capability to move, fight, and shoot.  Both have a basic shoot ability that degrades over range (although in two different ways, depending on the C&C title).  And both are scenario driven.  But there are some differences.First, C&C uses cards to drive the action - you have a hand of cards and select one to do your turn.  In HtL it works differently.  Each side in a scenario has a basic rating (2,3,4, etc) that equates into a number of actions per turn.  To that, a D3 is rolled and added, and the total is the number of actions you can perform on your side in a turn.  An action is move, or shoot.  A unit may do either, but not both.  Since you have a bunch of units on your side, as in C&C, you are only dealing with a fraction of your forces on any one turn.Second, there is the question of combat and the effects of range on shooting.  In C&C, the systems all use special dice, with symbols representing the different sorts of effects that can occur.  In HtL, simple D6 are used, and each unit gets a certain number of dice to roll.  There is a target number to make on the dice to cause a hit, and that target number gets reduced with range.  In the C&C games, many units receive few dice at range, although given the symbol based dice, the possibilities of a hit per die are the same.Third, the C&C games all use nice physical representations of the units - either plastic soldiers or attractively stickered blocks.  HtL uses very attractive, heavy duty, counters that are easy to read, easy to handle, and have nice identifiable art.  It makes setup very fast.  Although I must admit - I am a sucker for plastic army men, and block based games...In all, I think it is a very nice game, quick to set up, and fun.  The tactical challenges of the scenarios are really enjoyable, and the overall tempo of the game (where, since you are moving only a few units per turn, and you need to really set up a battle line for success, as is appropriate for 18th century warfare, it can take a few turns to adequately prepare and execute an attack) are refreshing.A good friend of mine, Charles Cabell, has a very nice video review of the game, here...Overall Hold the Line gets Two Thumbs Up from Gaming with Chuck.  Good job from Worthington Games."},
{"title": "Traveller Tuesdays - Offworld and Orbital Facilities", "date": "Tuesday, December 4, 2012", "text": "[NOTE - This article has been updated, there is a section below (indicated in Red), that has been updated, in a later article posted here.] So, in a planetary system where there is a large enough population, of a technology level high enough, it is quite likely that the population will move out into the high orbit of the main world, and onto other planets and moons in the system.  This is a quick and easy way to determine what sorts of facilities exist within a system.First, a recap of how the Mongoose version of Traveller determines what sort of bodies exist within a stellar system, other than the main world.  This is based on what is in Book 3: Scout, pages 92-93.  This system determines the bodies of the system that are important for play, not necessarily all of the bodies within the system.  We can take that to mean (within the constraints of \"important for play\" as being bodies where there are likely to be habitations or facilities, among other things).First the Jump Shadow of the star is determined.  This is the 100xD (where D is the diameter of the star) sphere within which making an interstellar jump is dangerous.  It is determined by rolling 1d6, to determine how many \"orbits\" (orbital positions that are likely to contain a body) are within that sphere.Next, roll a second d6 and add in the number of orbits within the Jump Shadow, to determine the total number of orbits that are of interest around this star.  As mentioned, this system does not concern itself with \"uninteresting\" orbits, or orbits that are insignificant.  This gives a total number of orbits somewhere between 2 and 12 that are of interest, and some number of those - the ones closest to the Star - are within the jump shadow of that Star.Keeping in mind how many Planetoid Belts and how many Gas Giants exist within the system, the next step is to determine how many orbits are within the different zones of the system. The possible zones are the Inner Zone, the Habitable Zone, and the Outer Zone.Gas GiantThis is done by rolling 2d6 - the lowest of the two dice representing how many of the orbits of the system are within the Inner Zone (those orbits where there is just too much heat or solar radiation for life to comfortably exist).  The highest of the two dice represents the first orbit of the Outer Zone.  Any orbits between these two (if any) are considered to be the Habitable Zone.[EDIT - This section has been heavily modified, taking advantage of interesting results from T5.  The modification have been presented here.  The replaced section has been marked off as a red block quote, scroll down to the regular text, to return from the revised section.]For each orbit, roll 2d6.  Depending on the Zone, the results of this die roll will determine the contents of that orbit.  This system assumes that there is something in every orbit, even though it does not determine the distance between the orbits.For the Inner Zone -Double 6s indicate that the system has a significant companion star, and it replaces the last orbit of the Outer Zone.  Ignore further companion star results (i.e. - only one companion star can be generated in this system).Double 1s indicate that a Gas Giant (if present within the system at all) exists.Otherwise, read the lowest dice of the 2d6 rolled, and consult the following chart.Small Terrestrial world (planet size 1-3)Large Terrestrial world (planet size 4+)Belt if available (size 0) or Planetoid (size 1)Small Ice world (planet size 2-4)Large Ice world (planet size 5+)Belt if available (size 0) or Planetoid (size 1)For the Habitable Zone -Double 6s indicates a companion star (as above) if a companion star has not already been placed.Other doubles suggest a Gas Giant (if available). Otherwise, read the lowest dice of the 2d6 rolled.For the Outer Zone -Double 6s indicates a companion star (as above) if a companion star has not already been placed.Other doubles suggest a Gas Giant (if available).Or if the total of the 2d6 is greater than half the value of the orbit, then also a Gas Giant (if available).Otherwise, read the highest dice of the 2d6 rolled.An Ice WorldFor each Gas Giant, significant Moons may be rolled for.  If the Gas Giant is in the Inner or Habitable Zone, then it will have 1d3 Terrestrial (size 1+) Moons, and 1d6 Ice World (size 2+) Moons.  If it is in the Outer Zone, then it will have 1d6 Terrestrial (size 1+) and 2d6 Ice World (size 2+) Moons.Terrestrial World Planets will have 1d3-1 moons.  Ice World Planets will have 1d3-2 moons.Once all orbits are filled using this system, consider the number of Gas Giants placed - if there are more Gas Giants to place, then just create new orbits outside the last Outer Zone orbit, but inside any Companion Star (i.e. \"push\" the companion star out, to make room for more Gas Giant orbits).Also consider the number of Belts that the system is to have.  If not enough have been generated, then create new orbits between the Habitable Zone and the Outer Zone, to accommodate the extra required Belts.Moons of a Gas GiantDetermine location of the Main World - If there is a Habitable Zone, then the Main World is placed in the middle of the Habitable Zone.  If the middle orbit there matches the Size of the UWP, then that is the Main World, otherwise create an additional orbit in the middle of the Habitable Zone for the Main World.If there is NO Habitable Zone, then roll 1d6.  If the result is a 6, then the Main World is a moon of the first Gas Giant in the system, otherwise the Main World is placed as the last orbit in the Inner Zone.Now, having determined the planetary contents of the system, the presence and relative location of planetary bodies, gas giants, moons and asteroid belts, the question turns to Offworld and Orbital Facilities.In order to determine how many such facilities exist, based on the UWP score for the Population, roll on the following table. Add to that number the Tech Level of the world, and subtract 7.  The result is the number of facilities within the system.  Note that if the Tech Level of the Main World is less than 8, all such facilities within the system are operated by organizations/governments other than this systems Main World.  Facilities GeneratedPop 0-2NonePop 3-41d6Pop 5-62d6Pop 7-83d6Pop 9-104d6Pop 11-125d6If there are 5 or few facilities, all of them will be determined on the Small Facility table.If there between 6 and 10 facilities, half of them (rounded up) will be determined on the Small Facility table.  The remainder will be determined on the Medium Facility table.If there are more than 10 facilities, then half of them (rounded up) will be on the Small Facility table.  Half of the remainder (rounded up) will be on the Medium Facility Table.  The remainder will be on the Large Facility table (but only if the Main World population is 5+, otherwise, these will also be Medium Facilities).If a result is rolled more than once, than each additional result gains a roll on the following table:  Repeat Results1Additional Rival Operation2Larger than Normal Facility3Higher Technology Facility4Dispersed Facility5Complex of Multiple Sites6Robotic/Automated AnnexIn the case of an additional rival operation, it is just that.  Another of the same facility, in a different location in the system, but of a separate governance, or ownership, from the first.A dispersed facility means that it is spread out to cover multiple orbital platforms (if orbital) or on multiple locations on the planetary body it is on (or maybe in orbit around different bodies, or on the surface of different bodies).  All of these working together, and in communication link, supporting each other.A complex of multiple sites means 1d6 of the facility in question, but somehow linked (either as an extremely large orbital colony, or as a surface, or sub-surface, colony on a planetary body in the system).Robotic/Automated annex facilities are a duplicate of the original of the type in question, but only the first is operated by live occupants/operators - this additional facility is operated through automation or by robots.  Small Facility1Education Facility2Religious Facility3Communications Outpost4Science/Research Lab5Power Generation6Sports/Recreation FacilityIf the world is on a regular Jump route, then a Communications Outpost is likely an X-Boat tending facility.  Otherwise Roll 1d6 - 1-3 In systems communications, 4-6 Interstellar communications.The population of Small Facilities is likely to be a population code of 1d3-1 (if 0, then it means a single individual is operating the facility).  Science Facility roll 1d6 - 1. Biology, 2. Physics, 3. Information, 4. Planetology, 5. Materials, 6. Psychology.  Roll 1d6 - 1,2 - Private, 3,4 - Planet Government, 5,6 - Interstellar Government.  Roll 1d6 - 1-3 - Applied; 4-6 - Theory.Education facilities roll 1d6 - 1. Trade School 2. Martial Arts 3. Religious Training 4. Science Training 5. Private school of Nobility 6. Psionics Training In the case of a Religions Facility or a Sports/Recreation Facility (either a zero grav sport, or a hotel/resort), the population code generated represents the operating staff, there are accommodations for several thousand visitors, on a short term basis.  Medium Facility1Manufacturing2Medical3Security4Food Production5Corporate Facility6Nature PreserveA Medium Facility is likely to have a population code of either 3 or 4.  Note that this represents the staff.  In the case of a Food Production or Nature Preserve facility, it is likely to be much larger than what would be necessary for the staff, as the facility contains large areas serving their function.A Medical facility is actually a Quarantine port on a 5+ (1d6), otherwise it is a hospital.If the world is a Captive Government, then the Security Facility belongs to the Captor Government, other wise it is a Port Authority facility, watching the Main World population, as well as any incoming or outgoing traffic.  Large Facility1Commerce Port2Residence/City3Shipyard4Military Facility5Fuel/Resource Station6Alien Population CenterA large facility is likely to have a population code of 5 or 6 (except the Residence/City - see below).A Commerce Port is either (1) Retail shopping, (2) Warehousing, (3) Resource Auction House,  (4) Cargo Handling center, (5) Major Financial Center, or (6) Trade Union Community.  Multiple results are each likely to be separate types.A Residence/City Facility will have a Population Code one less than that of the Main World.If the System has a Naval base, then the Military Facility is likely to be a Naval Weapons Station, otherwise it is likely to be a Barracks for either Army or Marines.If the System has an A, B or C Starport than the Fuel/Resource Station is likely to be a Fuel station, ancillary to that at the main Starport.  Otherwise, it is likely to be the headquarters of a Resource Extraction operation (like a Belt Mining facility, or a Mineral Extraction facility).An Alien Population Center is identical to the Residence/City Facility, except that it is populated by either Humans of a widely different culture, or actual Aliens. Finally, to determine the location of the Facility, roll 1d6.  On a 1-2 it is in orbit around the main world.  On a 3-4 it is in orbit around some other body in the system.  On a 5 it is on the surface of some other body in the system, and on a 6 it is below the surface of some other body in the system.Orbital Facilities can be in orbit around just about any body (Planet, Moon, Gas Giant, even the Star or its Companion, although these latter are likely only to be likely for Research Centers).Surface or SubSurface facilities will only be present on Terrestrial Worlds, Ice Worlds, or Planetoids (in or out of a belt).  They will not be on or under the surface of a Gas Giant.(note: NASA images from here)"},

{"title": "Theremin Thursdays - Iron Horse edition", "date": "Thursday, November 29, 2012", "text": "There are a lot of songs in the rich repertoire of North American music that concerns Railroads (there are a lot).  Not surprisingly, as railroading in many aspects is of great interest to me, this music is also of interest to me.The history of railroading, with powered locomotives, goes back to the turn of the century, 1800.  There about, several inventions came together (flanged rails in the last century, and steam engines most recently) to enable the major developments that lead us to what we view as the classic railroad - a powered locomotive pulling cars full of either passengers or cargo.  As a brief note of interest, however, cars on rails goes back to about 1550, when rails were first built in Germany to enable cargo wagons to travel easier.Railroading in Europe and North America grew and grew in prominence and sophistication all the way up to the point where road traffic started to supplant it economically.  Around the period of the 1930s, during the Great Depression, there is a ton of American folklore and history that has to do with railroads - it was a part of almost all aspects of life.  PBS did a very nice documentary about young hobos riding trains, called Riding the Rails, with information available here.  One of the things they did along with that was a nice article about the history of Railroad based music.  For the music selections in this edition of Theremin Thursdays, however, I am going to concentrate on some later music. First to not cover some territory already done in this area, I can point to a great article posted on the music blog, Hidden Track, called B List: 10 Best Songs about Trains.  Amongst other things, it covers two of my favorites - Casey Jones by the Grateful Dead, and Take the A Train by Duke Ellington.  As you can see, the coverage of Railroad themed music covers a lot of different genres, even in modern times.  The list at Hidden Track covers some of the greatest musicians of the pop music over the last 50 years (Pat Metheny, Gladys Night, Bob Marley, Rolling Stones, etc).The railroad companies themselves, in the mid 20th century, started putting out videos about their history and service, and some of these (for a gamer) are very interesting to watch.  Here are two that I think are pretty neat, although a Youtube search will uncover a lot more.  The first is a history of the Chicago and North Western Railroad (C&NW), released in 1948, the 100th anniversary of their existence.  There is some (fun) dramatization to watch in this, but also a nice history of the spread west of North American railroads.The second is a nice article about the impact of railroading on American industry and the economy.  If you play economic railroad games, this is a very interesting history worth watching.  It is from the New York Central Railroad, one of my personal favorites.But, now to the music, and then to the games.  The first is from Gordon Lightfoot.  Gordon Lightfoot's song the Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald is a great song, and will probably be part of a future Theremin Thursdays article. The song being featured here, of course, is the Canadian Railroad Trilogy.  What a great song, about the history of the Canadian Pacific Railroad.Another song from around the same era is Jim Croce's Railroad song.  What a great song.  There is a version on youtube, below, but it has some special effects added in for the train sounds.  Not sure I like those . . .I could add a link to Lynyrd Skynyrd's Railroad Song, but enough with the mellow stuff.  I will end the litany of music about railroad songs with one of the most fun (if ridiculous) songs about trains.  The song, of course, is Crazy Train by Ozzy.  But, for a video, I'll post a version of the song done by Iron Horse (what a cool Train name...), in a bluegrass mode.  At least I didn't post this version.Okay, so what about gaming and Railroads.  First, there is the immensely popular game Ticket to Ride.  But is it a train game?  There is a whole sub-hobby of railgaming purists out there who would say no (note: I gently disagree, as to me any game with a Train theme is a train game, but there are of course different types, and different levels of difficulty and degrees of simulation involved).  A fun game, and an excellent gateway game to the hobby of modern board gaming, but not a train game.  Okay, so then, what is a train game?  A future article could be dedicated to this very question, but it seems to include some aspect of rail line building; cargo delivery; be based on economics; and sometimes have some aspect of company control, or a stock market.  If we use that as the criteria, then our list is a lot shorter.The main categories seem to be three.  First, there is the whole large collection of very nice Crayon based Train games from Mayfair.  These are so nicknamed because they involve drawing on the game board, marking up your train segments, as you build them.  This could be done with crayons or with erasable markers, on a board specially built to be easily erasable.  The first of these was Empire Builder, but there have been lots and lots of successors.  You build your train network in the first phase of the game, and then you deliver cargo in the second phase of the game.  Nice. The next category are games where the main action is driven by control of various train companies, through the purchase or selling of stocks.  These are chiefly nicknamed \"18xx\" games because many of them feature a year from the 19th century (1830, 1860, 1853, etc) in the title.  One of the main influences in this category is the title 1830: Railways and Robber Barons from Mayfair, which was recently (and beautifully) reprinted.  These games have the players building routes, etc, but the main emphasis is on ownership, for determining control and winning the game.The third main category of train game that railgamers take seriously is the series that is heavily based on Martin Wallace's design in Age of Steam.  Successors have been Railways of the World, Railroad Tycoon (taking the name from the enormously successful series of computer based Railroad games), and Steam.  I personally have Steam and Railways of the World - both are good games, and all four of these differ in some very important ways.  These games have the player controlling one train company throughout the game, but the action of building train lines and then delivering cargo is what the game is all about.  All great games, in my opinion.  Here is a picture of Steam, one of my favorites.Okay, so those are the big categories, and I like them all.  Of the three my favorite is probably the third (Martin Wallace) category.  I love Steam, and I don't think I could play enough of it.  There are just so many layers of strategy to be employed, and lots of decisions (both tactical and strategic) - features I really like in games.There are, however, other games that even serious Railgamers might grudgingly acknowlede as railroad games.  Here is a nice list of shorter games.  One of the criticisms of the above three categories is that games of those types take a l_o_n_g time to play, typically.  Not as long as, say, a 6 player or 8 player version of the Avalon Hill class Civilization, but still, pretty long.So here is the list, it is called \"Train Games in An Hour or Less\" with the subtitle, \"Where you don't own a Company\".  Well, I don't know if Chicago Express breaks that rule, but it is still a very good list.A few of my favorites that are not in the categories above are First Train to Nuremberg (which was, btw, Dec 7, 1835);  Chicago Express (which features really cool dials on the board, but is also a great game); and Steel Driver (which involves stock shares, and line building, but is otherwise pretty benign).  One of the cool things to note about those three titles is that they all started life in different forms.First Train to Nuremberg - has long deep roots to Last Train to Wensleydale (the new version includes the old version).First Train to NurembergLast Train to WensleydaleChicago Express - Was originally Wabash Cannonball from the train game specialty publisher, Winsome Games. Chicago ExpressWabash CannonballThe third of this trifecta of Games Chuck Likes is:Steel Driver - Which is very strongly based on Prairie RailroadsSteel Driver (note: Rubik's Cubes not included)Prairie Railroads (updated Cube version)I think that in all three cases, the newer versions (First Train to Nuremberg, Chicago Express, and Steel Driver) are all very attractive games, with first rate components, but if it wasn't for the design pioneering with the originals, we might not have gotten there.Much the same with today's high speed rails, and the debt they owe to the pioneer in self powered railroads.Shape of the Future?

{"title": "A Splendid Little War - Wargaming Rules", "date": "Thursday, November 29, 2012", "text": "This week, Wargame Wednesdays presents a set of quickplay rules for the Spanish American War (SAW).  A friend of mine referred to this (lovingly) as the Spanko-Yanko war.  I don't know about that, but these rules were written to play some fun club night miniature wargames using the very nice \"Rough Riders\" figures recently re-released by The Virtual Armchair General.  As the website states, these were released back in the 90s by Richard Houston, and they were sculpted by Chris Ferree.The figures nice - not up to the standard of modern figures, but certainly fine for back in the 90s.  I bought a bunch of them from Patrick at TVAG when he first released them, and I got them painted up for me by a good friend in Virginia.  Well, one thing leads to another, and before you know it - there was talk in my old weekly club about playing a game with them.  So a ruleset was needed, and for small projects like this I really like homebrew rules, so \"A Splendid Little War\" was born.Get action. Seize the moment. Man was never intended to become an oyster.- Theodore RooseveltA Splendid Little WarWars for small, quick games simulating land combat in the Spanish American Warby Chuck Turnitsa Figures and Battlefield15mm figuresInfantry stands are 25mm square (or whatever is convenient).MG and Artillery stands are 30mm square (or whatever is convenient). Units should be organized by stands.An infantry unit should have between 4 and 6 stands.  A Machine Gun unit should have 1 standAn Artillery unit should have 1 standEach stand should have several figures mounted on it  An Infantry unit should have 3 figures A Machine Gun unit should have 1 MG and 2 crew membersAn Artillery unit should have 1 gun and 2 crew members The table top should be prepared before the battle.  The fighting space should have ample areas of cover (jungle), especially at the edge of the battlefield.  There should be one or two small built up areas, on a road network, in the central part of the battlefield.  Roads have no effect in the game, unless they pass through jungle, then they permit full speed movement, and also artillery movementGame SetupEach side should have 3 or more brigades     of troops.Each brigade should have a handful of     units.Infantry units are from 4-6 stands of infantryMG units are 1 stand of machine gunsArtillery units are 1 stand.Prepare a card for each brigade, identified on the card. Prepare 1 “bonus” card for each side.Shuffle all these cards together. Turn SequenceTake turns flipping over a card.  When a card is flipped, all of the units     in that brigade may move.If a bonus card is flipped, a Brigade that HAS ALREADY MOVED may move again. Units that contacted the enemy during the first move may not move during this bonus move.If a bonus card is flipped first, then that side may identify a Brigade of the enemy’s as “pinned” which means that it may not move that turn on its regular card. If the enemy draws its own bonus card,after it would have normally moved the “pinned” brigade, then it may moveit normally.All units move 6 inches each turn. Artillery may not enter rough terrain. Infantry and MG units move half in rough terrain (except Moro warriors and Philippine Scouts).If an Artillery unit or MG unit move, they may not shoot.An Infantry unit may charge the enemy.If this is the case, the unit gets +1d6 inches added to their basic move.See charges and responses (below) to determine what happens during a charge, and how a unit may respond to being charged.After all cards have been flipped, and all units have moved then all artillery and MG fire takes place, simultaneously.After all artillery and MG fire is done, then all infantry fire takes place, simultaneously. Units charged may fire; charging units may not.After all firing takes place, then fight hand to hand combat (see charges and responses, below).Shuffle cards and begin next turn.Firing SequenceInfantry may fire 12 inchesMG may fire 24 inchesArtillery may fire 48 inchesInfantry fire is done by rolling 1d6 per stand firing, and scores a hit on a 5 or 6.MG fire is done by rolling 3d6 per crewman (there are 2 crewman per MG stand, initially), and score a hit on a 5 or 6.Artillery fire is done by first picking a target point, then rolling a drift dice and 1d6 (2d6 if over half range). If the drift dice indicates a hit, then good, otherwise drift the target point the amount rolled on the dice.Roll 1d6, and any unit within 1 inch of     the landing point takes that many hits.US units under cover may be fired at, but receive a save of 4,5,6 per hit scored.Spanish units under cover may not be fired at (they are adept at hiding – learned in the war against Cuban rebels – and are using smokeless powder, so are not easily spotted).Units under cover may fire out of cover, if they are at he edge of that cover.Units that lose a stand must test morale – see below.Each infantry stand can suffer three hits before being removed.Each MG stand can suffer two hits before being removed.  After 1 hit, it can only move half speed.Each Artillery stand can suffer two hits before being removed.  After 1 hit, it cannot move, but may still pivot to fire. Charge and ResponseWhen a unit wishes to charge, before measuring the distance to the charger, roll 1d6 and add that many inches to the unit’s move.If the unit has enough move to contact the enemy, then the charge is a success.If the unit does not have enough move to contact the enemy, then it stops after moving as far as it can.The charged unit may shoot during the Firing sequence part of the turn, but only at the charging unit.The charging unit may not fire, even if it did not contact the enemy.If the charging unit loses a stand, and then tests morale, it may fail (see below).  If it does fail the morale test, then it does not make contact (but may be shot at by the charged unit).If the charged unit gets to move after being contacted, and wants to evade, it moves away 1d6 inches. If the charging unit has enough remaining movement to catch it, then it is removed from the game. An evading unit may not fire or charge another unit.If the charging unit makes contact, then both sides roll 1d6. The higher modified roll wins, the loser taking the difference in hits. The winning unit automatically takes 1 hit. The losing unit automatically routes (see below)The following modifiers affect the dice toss.Charging unit gets +1Larger unit gets +1Unit defending earth works or in a building gets +1Morale and ResultsWhen a unit has to roll a morale test, roll 1d6, if it is Less than the number of stands remaining it passes.If a unit fails morale, it has two choices, it can route, or take 1 full stand as casualties.If a unit routes, move it 2d6\" away from the enemy.  It is marked as routing.When a routing unit's Brigade is activated in the turn sequence, then roll a morale test for the routing unit, if it passes, it recovers from routing, and may turn to face the enemy.  If it fails, it continues routing (2d6\")."},
{"title": "Traveller Tuesdays - Mercenary Encounters in Sphere Fenix", "date": "Tuesday, November 27, 2012", "text": "As a client state of the Third Imperium, one of the things that Sphere Fenix is well known for, is being the source of a number of very well known mercenary companies.  This is one of the few pieces of information about the economy of the Sphere that we get from the write up in the original Judges Guild publication of Crucis Margin.As Mercenary craft are one of the possible encounters from the Sphere Fenix encounter system that has been slowly being developed here, it seemed appropriate to spend a little bit of digital ink on describing some of the main Mercenary Companies that operate both inside of and outside of the Sphere.  An actual table of encountered craft will follow in a separate article.Excellent Hammer's Slammers painting by Shimmering Sword on Deviant Art When people discuss the Mercenary Companies of the Sphere, the phrase often used is \"Mercenary Corps\".  That is referring to any one (usually) of the Big Six.  While there are uncountless small subcontractor and independent operators (usually with not much more than a Company in strength of operatives, as well as some undetermined level of organic support - sometimes vehicles, sometimes drones and robotics, sometimes artillery, sometimes atmospheric craft, and sometimes starships), there are really on six big operators.  These corporations boast not only division strength (or much more) capability of ground forces, but also can field a full gamut of support equipment, from state of the art automaton support (robotics and drones), through atmospheric craft wings, and fleets of starships.Gordon R.

This company has its HQ and its history on the Sphere Fenix world of Marada, in the Mandin Subsector.Marada (0813)  A484776-E  N Ag Ri Marada is the third world around the star Diusi Alpha.  The system features 6 planets, 2 planetoid belts, and no gas giants.  The planet has an A class starport capability, with multiple ground port locations, and the main facility being an orbital high port.  Affiliated with that high port (DeLonga high port) there is also a Sphere naval facility, called Port Marada.  The planet itself is balkanized, with a number of different nation states splitting up its population of 5 million.  There are numerous space facilities, both on the single moon of Marada, as well as on other bodies, and in the planetoid belts, of the system.  The main world benefits from being both Agricultural and Rich. Black Mountain as a company is headquartered in the desert nation known as the Kingdom of Erdos.  The company itself gains it's name from the tallest mountain on the planet, which is in the Kingdom.  The company recruits from the various military bodies on the planet, as well as retirees and veterans of the Sphere Fenix Navy and Naval Infantry, that are in surplus because of Port Marada.  Many of the senior officer corps of Black Mountain were/are nobility in the Kingdom of Erdos, and largely also share the same religion/philosophy common to that part of Marada.  This is called Zen Positivism and gives warriors who follow it a sort of bushido code. Being as close as it is to the Mandanin Co-Dominion, the company does feature several companies of Danin infantry, taking advantage of their natural martial nature to use them as rough terrain shock troops.  These Danin Companies are all commanded, at the field level, by Danin Officers.  Together they refer to themselves as the Tooth and Claw regiment.  The Danin homeworld of Kalradin is in the same subsector, which may explain why so many Danin in the male stage of development are available for employment.Force Green, Ltd. -This company is very decentralized, but if it has a focused HQ, then that would be at the planetoid world of Marden, in the Negoiul subsector.Marden  (1208) B000663-C    AsMarden is itself a shepherd moon (although small enough to be classed a Planetoid with size 0) around the gas giant Herscheli-2.  The star, Herscheli Gamma has 3 planets, and one gas giant.  The gas giant, in addition to the moon Marden, has a very mineral rich ring.  The whole system is a captive of the socialist bureaucracy that manages the nearby planet of Lycabettus (1209/Negoiul).  That world is classified as poor, because of bureaucratic mis-management, but also is quite mineral poor.  Because of it, multiple orbital colonies have been set up around Hescheli-2 to mine the gas giant of all sorts of resources (gas and mineral) and ship them back to Lycabettus.  Force Green, Ltd has a permanent contract to the Lycabettus government to provide security services at the moon of Marden.  Between the moon and the many orbital mining stations, there is a population of 400,000.  Locally, Force Green Ltd. has an employee force of approximately 20,000, about half of those are combat/security operatives, and the other half provide the administrative support for both the Marden contract, and other contracts that the company hires out for.  Force Green tends to prefer long term contracts, performing either training, force protection, or security.  They have a fleet of starships, of course, and many administrative operations located where their contracts are, but they do not prefer to maintain heavy support equipment.Red Flag Corporation - This company does not maintain a planet-side headquarters, but rather has a mobile starship based HQ.  In an early version of the failed company that Red Flag Corporation formed out of (Stayne Company), a contract for the Third Imperium included as payment a certain percentage of recovered salvage.  One of the things recovered was a lightning class cruiser, Imperial tail number 6396, the Guardian Rainbow.  The ship was rebuilt by Stayne Company (one of the misadventures that bankrupted that mercenary outfit), and renamed the Hecate.  The Third Imperium required that the Nuclear Dampeners and Meson Screens were removed, as well as the facilities for maintaining fissionable and fusionable munitions for the missile racks. When Stayne failed, and Red Flag Corporation was formed, the Hecate was one of the assets that the new company acquired. Unlike a standard Lightning Class Cruiser, the Hecate has had half of its 800t fighter storage space reclaimed and converted to troops storage, with training and recreation facilities included.Red Flag Corporation specializes in space based operations, preferring to provide contracts for orbital facilities, starships, airless environments, and other space based locales.  They do not maintain heavy ground equipment, or atmospheric craft.  In addition to the Hecate, the Corporation also maintains a few dozen other, smaller, starships.  In most cases, these feature (in additional to normal ship's craft) boarding cutters rather than planetary landing shuttlecraft.Teekl and Salan - This is a mercenary organization in flavor very similar to Hammer's Slammers.  It started out as a number of officers (Jon Teekl and Lisa Salan) who had recently cashiered out of Imperial Army service took their savings, and pooling those resources, secured some work as a Security outfit.  Slowly, reinvesting their early profits, Teekl and Salan (T&S) began to grow and grow.  Today, they even own a planet, having purchased the world of Wager from the Middle Kingdom (the star kingdom of Chhung Kuo).   Wager         2302 D566569-9    AgWager is the second planet around the star Silla Mu, and the system has 4 other planets, and a planetoid belt.  The world only has a populatoin of approximately 10,000, almost all of which are either employees of T&S, or dependents.  The majority of the population lives in a single arcology, called Chipdown Tower, and much of the agriculture richness of the planet is harvested by robotic factories.  Painting by Daniel Maland, that captures very well what Chipdown Tower looks like.The government is classified as Captive, because although it is technically a company meritocracy, all of the adjudicating and validation of those who serve are subjected to oversight and approval by Chhung Kuo representatives - one of the conditions that were placed on the Company when they purchased the planet (actually, it was part of payment for a job).  The local starport is somewhat crude, and T&S do not maintain much of their own fleet, preferring to hire out ships when needed.  The world has a high law level, but that only represents the intrusion of the Chhung Kuo overseers, and also the restriction on personal ownership of firearms.  Firearms owned as part of service to T&S  Wager is in the Souris subsector, located between the borders of Ramayan, Chhung Kuo and Sphere Fenix.  Needless to say, there is plenty of local work on the many worlds, and governments, within those star nations, but Teekl and Salan is still commanded, at the top, by a number of ex Imperial officers and Nobles, so they also favor contracts for the Imperium and for Imperial worlds.Harris Rangers - The Rangers are a land mobility based Mercenary Company.  They specialize in armored units, and supporting artillery and logistics equipment.  They are not interested in space based operations (such as security contracts on space stations), nor do they operate a lot of infantry or atmospheric attack craft units.  Because of this they almost exclusively seek out contracts where they are involved in a force-on-force conflict, and they provide the armor edge to their employers.The Rangers are stationed on the very small and very dry world of Tarat in the Olsztyn subsector.  The world is home to a population of 3,000, almost all of whom are employees of the Harris Rangers.  There is a taint in the atmosphere that, when exposed to for a period of time, renders the human female reproduction functions as inoperable (temporarily).  This can be countered by medication, although a lot of the officer corps of the Rangers who are female find the situation to be quite desirable.Tarat         1311 C441455-A    Ni Po The world is the 3rd planet around the Ubin Rho star system, and it shares it with 4 other planets, and two gas giants.  The world is almost perfect for training, with a very light gravity field, and being extremely dry (almost a desert world).  The starport is adequate for the hired transport traffic that comes into and out of the system to service the Harris Ranger's heavy lift demands.  Umor Downport, almost always in perpetual night.Tarat has a very minor axial tilt, and almost no seasonal variety.  The poles are almost always very dark, and the main starport for the world, Umor Down, is located at the 'north' pole of the planet.  An enclosed maglev train provides both cargo and passenger service to the main population and work center of the corporation, somewhat further 'south' on the planet.Dover Command - Another general-purpose, mercenary company.  Dover Command came out of the early days of Sphere Fenix, being an organization that formed out of the armed element of one of the three main factions that eventually came out of the warring period and formed the Sphere.  That organization was the Megar Brotherhood, whose capital was the world of Jipujapa in the Negoiul Subsector.  The Megar Brotherhood was an alliance of about a dozen worlds, all of which subscribed to a philosophy of equality and personal freedom.  They had a very effective military, but in the end, could not persevere over their rivals, and so sued for peace and became part of the Sphere.  A number of Officers from the Brotherhood Defense Force (BDF) decided to stick together.   They pooled some resources that they had, and purchased Dover Island on Jipujapa, which was a state of the art training facility of the BDF, complete with an atmospheric craft base, and ample room for expansion on the island.  This became the organization Dover Command, and they started taking on contracts, and slowly grew and grew over the past two centuries into a very large Mercenary operation.Jipujapa      1010 B786899-D    RiJipujapa is a rich planet,  with a population of 70 million, participating in a very effective, centralized bureaucracy.  Dover Island has been granted, by historic tradition to the breakup of the Megar Brotherhood, some autonomy and independence from the rest of the Planet.  The Command operates their own starport facilities, consisting of both Courant High Port, an orbital facility where much of the operational heavy equipment of the corporation is stored until required on a contract (to avoid the expense of lifting it up out of the gravity well), and also of Japa Mountain Spaceport, located high on the flat topped Japa mountain in the center of Dover Island.Japa Mountain SpaceportDover Command is known for being ruthlessly independent, a factor that has probably contributed to their long existence and success.  As they own all their own transportation and logistics assets, this is far easier for them to do, than for other mercenary corporations, as they have to rely very little on either their employer or other contractors for support or transportation out of a bad situation.Note: There is an absolute ton of information about Hammer's Slammers (one of my favorite Sci Fi mercenary organizations) in the Mongoose Publishing Traveller Variant by that name.  See a number of cool free downloads at their website."},
{"title": "Ticket to Ride on the iPad", "date": "Monday, November 26, 2012", "text": "Quick Review - First, Ticket to Ride is a great game, and a favorite at Gaming with Chuck HQ.  But, this is a quick review of the iPad implementation.It is great.  Very colorful, easy to navigate, intuitive, and has a nice timing to the effects and feedback to the user.  A great game.  And many of the published boards are available as in game purchases to expand your choices.One of the things that makes this title rise from Very Good to Great, however, is the ability to play locally over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. If you have two folks with iPads, they can both log into the game, and play if they are in the same locale.  So no sharing the device, no accidentally seeing your opponent's cards, none of that.  A great experience.As many readers of gaming blogs, and gaming news in general, may be aware, a number of individuals recovered the TSR name and have reformed a company using the same.Their first project will be the publication of Gygax Magazine.I think that the logo alone speaks volumes about how much this is intended to resemble the (good) old days of Dragon Magazine.If you haven't heard then here it is - TSR has reformed and will be publishing a general gaming (heavy on RPGs) magazine called Gygax magazine.  If you are interested in signing up for email notifications about publication, etc, then you can go to this website.There are evidently some riffs in the Gygax family over who is and who is not supporting it, but it definitely seems to have the support of Gary's two brothers Sons (I mistakenly had them identified as Brothers, see comment below).With the recent publication of the 1st Edition reprints (PHB, MM, DMG) and the upcoming reprint of the 2nd Edition books, the folks at Wizards of the Coast definitely have gotten the vibe about the Old School Renaissance that is out there.  It makes sense.  The millions of gamers who grew to love D&D in it's earlier versions, loved it as it was.  Changing it too much will lose them.Regardless of politics about the magazine, etc etc, I just am glad that the older style RPGs are still being played by so many.  Mr. Gygax and his compadres certainly changed the world a bit when they introduced all of us to Dungeons and Dragons."},
{"title": "Theremin Thursdays - Thanksgiving Edition", "date": "Thursday, November 22, 2012", "text": "So, I type this Thursday evening, with the Turkey having been eaten (ceremoniously, and with lots of pause for good conversation and discussion of our excellent situation here at GwC HQ - we truly are a blessed family).In thinking of a theme for this weeks article on Music and Gaming, it occurred to me.  There is a topic that has gotten a lot of coverage in pop music over recent years, that is also a topic that segues into gaming quite nicely.And that topic is Superman.  The Man of Steel.I won't go into the slobbering depths of fanboy delight that I personally get from reading Superman (and related) stories, but I will point out that the man has Staying Power as a character.  I know, a lot of folks who aren't fans think that a Superman story is, well, boring.  I mean - really, he can do it all, right?  Well, the stories are good, and have stood the test of time, precisely because he can't do everything - and more importantly, he is surrounded by a cast of very, very interesting supporting characters.But Superman, while being (arguably) the first super powered hero (although some of the mysterious and super-perfect pulp characters that preceded Superman and the meteoric rise of comic book heroes were very, very close to being super powered themselves) is today only a part of a much larger pantheon of super heroes in the line of ongoing titles from DC (Detective Comics, or at least it was once upon a time).Those heroes, and the universe in which they dwell (and enjoy adventurous stories, in both print and film) has been the subject of a couple of gaming efforts, but currently the two main ones are a DC Heroes clix figures (not my cup of tea) and the DC Adventures role playing game.But, for music, back to Superman.  Here are a few songs from recent years, concerning the Man of Steel.First up, is Kryptonite by 3 Doors Down.  I like this song, the pace, and the music.  The lyrics are pretty good, and for the sake of this article, it is certainly inspired by the Big Red Cape, and of course, his green nemesis.Next up is Superman by Goldfinger.  I'm not sure, but this may be the only Ska song about a superhero.  Long time readers of Gaming with Chuck may realize that we have a fondness here for Ska, especially Madness.  This is a pretty good song, and again - it passes the Son of Krypton test.Okay, so the Ska song is out of the way.  The next title has got to be Superman's Song from Crash Test Dummies.  I loved these guys from when they first came out, and probably in no small way because of this song.The Crash Test Dummies song is good (pretty solid) but it is also high on my list because it is one of the few pop culture references (outside of comic books or animated movies, etc, based on comic books) that mentions the Super Man villain, Solomon Grundy.  I like Solomon Grundy, as a villain.  A lot.  There was a two part story from the really well done DC super hero series, Justice League, that featured Solomon Grundy teaming up with some heroes (Dr. Fate, Hawkgirl, and Aquaman) to take on an extra dimensional being.  The episode was called The Terror Beyond and is excellent on about a hundred different levels, not least of which, because it is strongly based on one of the few Marvel super hero groups I really liked, the Defenders - but with the Marvel characters replaced by DC counterparts.  Solomon Grundy was a stand in for the Hulk, but brought more interest to the story because Grundy is a bona fide villain, as well as being a misunderstood monster much like the Hulk.  In the episode, Grundy dies, and is concerned about whether he will NOW find his soul (the reward he wanted for teaming up with the heroes was to finally get a soul).  Here is the clip - note, if you aren't a super hero fan, this will be EXTREMELY campy.Okay, put away the kleenex, you KNOW that Solomon Grundy will be back.  The next song comes from an album that was one of my absolute favorites back when I was in college (just a few years before the first Crash Test Dummies album came out).  That album was Life's Rich Pageant, by REM, and the song (of course) is Superman.Finally, the last song about Clark Kent, err, Superman is this old gem from the Kinks - Superman.  Nice song... (\"I'd like to fly but I can't even swim...\") I love super hero role playing games.  I like running the games. I like making up super heroes and villains. I like postulating what effects super powers will have on physics, and then translating that effect into game terms.  I love super hero role playing games.  However, I must admit that while I am Heavily influenced by the DC universe, I never played the older DC Heroes role playing game.  It was from Mayfair and had about a zillion products.  I read some (and even used them in my own superhero game of choice - which is Champions from Hero Games), but never ran or played the game. The new one is from Green Ronin publishing, and is based on the Mutants and Masterminds game engine.  Not a bad choice - it is pretty easy to understand, easy to play, and is strongly rooted in the D20 gaming perspective that has dominated the gaming scene since AD&D 3rd Edition was first published (and continues under the Pathfinder umbrella).Currently the products available are the DC Adventures Hero Book (the basic rule book).  At $26 (more or less) from Amazon, this is a nice deal for a role playing game.  It is based on 3rd Edition Mutants and Masterminds, and other than having a slight reputation for being densely packed with info (that's a bad thing?) and the info being hard to find (that IS a bad thing), it appears as if this book is very well received.  The other two publications currently in print are Heroes and Villains, volumes 1 and 2.  These are an exhaustive list of DC characters from across the decades, written up in gaming terms.  Very nice, even if you don't play DC Adventures."},
{"title": "Traveller Tuesday - Bonus Thanksgiving Edition", "date": "Wednesday, November 21, 2012", "text": "Filling in the details for the generated types of ships can be a good task for random tables, as well as an additional input vector of campaign info into the game.  Some extra tables are provided here for Traders, Scientists, and Mercenaries.Traders give a nice selection of recurring small ship encounters that provide a source of allies, rivals and potential patrons available on all worlds in the campaign.Scientists give a series of encounters that provide details on some of the research institutions of the campaign.Mercenaries fill the same niche as Traders, but with a more militaristic flair.  And given the amount of mercenary training that goes on in Sphere Fenix (mercenary services to the Imperium and elsewhere is a large part of the Sphere's export economy), these encounters are likely to play a decent role in the game.Traders are presented below, Scientists and Mercenaries will be in the next Traveller posting.TradersThis category represents independent operators (or at most small groups, owning typically only one ship).  The following table gives some examples of those that might be encountered in or around Sphere Fenix.  To generate an encounter, roll 1d6 for column A.  Then, if the nearest world is within 1 parsec, roll 1d6 for column B, or if the nearest world is 2 parsecs away (or more), roll 1d6 for column C.

{"title": "Traveller Tuesdays - Encounters in Sphere Fenix (3)", "date": "Tuesday, November 20, 2012", "text": "This week for Traveller Tuesdays, Gaming with Chuck is continuing in a series of articles on random encounters in Sphere Fenix - a star government in the first quadrant of the Crucis Margin sector that spans approximately 15-20 parsecs across.  The reason for this approach was to generate enough background information about the organizations and ships in and around Sphere Fenix to be useful for a sandbox type game.  All of this will be gather up into a pdf once it is finished. There are times when a random starship needs to be determined (as a floating hulk, derelict, victim of a pirate, or other reason).

{"title": "Theremin Thursdays - Ein Feste Berg", "date": "Friday, November 16, 2012", "text": "Another article in a series exploring the connections between Gaming and Music, and other outlets of popular culture.So, one of the major events in the development of modern society in the Western world was the Reformation.  On the surface, of course, it was a movement to identify that the Church was not the sole authority over man's relationship with God (and by extension, in an age of pervasive religiosity, also not the sole authority over all aspects of society).  Regardless of where an individual is within the Catholic-Protestant-Other taxonomy, it must be realized that the Reformation enabled society to separate Church authority from secular authority, and also the essential roots of ideas about freedom of religion, tolerance of others, and the value of the individual versus the society.All very important stuff. However, as lofty as all this is, here at Gaming with Chuck, and especially during Theremin Thursdays, we are (for the moment) interested in the effects of the Reformation on both Music and Gaming.  We will start out with music, one piece in particular, and then look at a few related games.Approximately 10 years after he nailed the 95 Theses to the door of that famous church in Germany (actually, it was \"Ninety-Five Theses on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences\" and they were nailed to the door of All-Saints Church, in Wittenberg, Germany), Martin Luther composed the song A Mighty Fortress Is Our God (actually \"Ein Feste Berg ist unser Gott\").  It has been a cornerstone of protestant hymnals ever since, especially the Lutheran Church, in one form or another.  If you have never heard it, here is a version in English.  I say a version, because it has been translated into English alone over 70 times.By the way, Luther's music was included by J.S. Bach in his fantastic cantata, BWV 80. Okay, so a great hymn, written by a great man, from a great (although tumultuous) time.  What about it's relationship to gaming?  Well, there are a couple of games that I would like to consider, two board games, and a role playing game setting.  Two of them share the name (A Mighty Fortress) from the hymn written by Luther.  The third bears a phrase uttered by Luther (\"Here I Stand\") during his defense before the Diet of Worms.  Here is a fantastic video, with Joseph Fiennes playing Martin Luther, giving a hollywood version of the defense (in actuality, Luther answered the first half of this scene one day, and then asked for a day to consider, before his final answer that contains the immortalized defense, \"Here I stand, I can do no other\").  This is from the movie \"Luther\" 2003.  By the way, it should be pointed out that this is a pretty good depiction of Luther, even if it is performed by Voldemort's brother.Before getting to the game titles, and risk being labeled as being \"too serious\", Gaming with Chuck would like to point out that Martin Luther was an earthy fellow (despite having a PhD, like the author of this blog), and enjoyed a good beer or wine as much as the rest of us.  There is a letter he wrote to his wife on the subject (see the nice article here), once, where he claimed that the beer he was drinking on a trip was \"strange to him\" and if he did not get his own stock forwarded to him, he might not be able to return to home because of the new beer he was drinking.  In light of that, we present one possible vision of how Martin Luther may have celebrated Oktoberfest (with apologies to the All Saint's Church in Wittenberg).Okay, the games.  The first (and oldest) is the (1977) SPI Title, A Mighty Fortress.  The game is a very solid, and not overly-complex design.  This was a multi-player (6 players) game about the Reformation and the Counter Reformation.The game featured not only markers representing Clergy going back and forth to convince states to favor one side or the other (in essence, converting, or re-converting countries), but also featured some military action (the beginning of the Wars of Religion).  A reprint of the original (with updated graphics, but not much else changed) came out from Excalibre games in 2011 (available on the Decision Games website).  Here is an image of part of the map, followed by the blurb from Excalibre Games:A Mighty Fortress: Between 1531 and 1555 the world shook to thereverberations of a struggle whose resolution was to chart the course ofEurope’s religious and political alliances for centuries. It was in these yearsthat the conflicting ideologies of Lutheran Reformation and CatholicCounter-Reformation inexorably drew the disparate empires, nations, and leadersof Europe into a maelstrom of religious war and dispute.A MightyFortress simulates this major historical conflict on a beautifullyillustrated political map of Europe. Colorful cardboard playing pieces move,position. And engage in battle upon this map through a superimposed hexagonalgrid, which functions like a chessboard’s squares.Game components include: one rules booklet, 200 die cutplaying pieces, one 22 x 34 inch map, and various player aids.Overall, a very good game, and one that was worthy of being reprinted.Our next title is the much more modern boardgame, Here I Stand. This is a game from GMT, published in 2006, concerning similar events as A Mighty Fortress, but in a more modern design.The game was reprinted in 2010 (with some component improvements).Movement is point to point, rather than hex map, but the biggest change is that this is a card driven wargame design.  The action, from turn to turn, is governed by card play (which grants all sorts of map based activity). Here are some sample cards.The designer, Ed Beach has a nice web page discussing aspects of the game.  The most excellent wargaming graphics design artist, Mark Mehaffey has a very nice redrawn map, presented on his website, here. Finally the last item to bring up this time is \"A Mighty Fortress\", which was a setting handbook for 2nd Edition Advance Dungeons and Dragons (or AD&D2E as the cobbler elves at Gaming with Chuck refer to it as).  This was a general handbook for setting roleplaying campaings during the Renaissance in general, and the Reformation in particular.  And why not?  As a setting, it has a lot to be desired - strong possibilities for conflict, lots of mobile classes of personages that can be used as archetypes for characters, a period when there are a lot of different nationalities and societies in contact with each other, and loads and loads of historical material about the conflict (and legends) of the time. This was in the REF (Campaign Reference) manual series, all of which gave insight into how to play in either Historical or Mythological settings from history.  Very nice work.  It had lots of information about the military hardware of the time, as well as the various nationalities, and ideas of how to play spies, soldiers, adventurers, diplomats, swashbucklers, and clerics from the period.Before you say \"pooh, pooh\" to this idea of a setting for a fantasy roleplaying game, consider the introduction of Magic in a period where you have two very strong, and one of them very authoritarian, Religious systems in a society that has reasons to believe in all sorts of magic, supernatural, and mystical forces.  For reference, consider the fantastic tales of Robert E Howard about his hero, Solomon Kane.  That character has served as the basis not only for the Howard stories, but also pastiches from other authors, as well as comic books, and a movie.  The character travels across Reformation Europe (if stretched to include the English Civil War and the Wars of Religion in the 17th century, including the Thirty Years War), battling not only the typical bandits and vile crooked noblemen and women, but also witches, demons, werewolves and all sorts of other supernatural foes.While that may or may not be your idea of gaming, it is out there and it is available.  Let me say, however, that despite Howard's flights of fancy, much of what he wrote about is in type, if not in instance, part and parcel of the Reformation mind.So, from Martin Luther, through J.S. Bach, down to Solomon Kane.  That is Theremin Thursdays for this week, I hope you get to do some gaming this weekend."},
{"title": "Wargame Wednesdays - Multi-Player Game Ordering", "date": "Wednesday, November 14, 2012", "text": "One of the things that is hard to deal with, in multiplayer games (especially large participation-style Miniatures games) is the ordering of player actions during a turn.The very fun, multiplayer western gunfight rules(\"The Rules with No Name\") from Foundry miniatures (at least the old free version, that I still use) has the concept of an action card for each character in the scenario, and a referee flips through those cards, one at a time, to determine order of actions.  This is not uncommon for a lot of small scale skirmish games.  One of the things that is good, is that the ordering within a turn is unknown to the players.  One of the bad things is that the players have no control over the ordering within the turn.  One of the nice things that \"The Rules with No Name\" provides is a couple of wild cards in the game, that can be collected, and used for out of sequence actions.This system (flip a card, that player gets an action) is OKAY.  It sometimes bogs down, as players not doing anything tend to sit around for a while, waiting for their action to come up.  I would like to try a system that allows some player interaction, without detracting from the main game.  It will involve cards (normal playing cards are fine, but having two matched decks is better), and 2 six sided dice.The idea is to assign each player (up to four) each a suite of cards.  Then assemble a small deck of ten cards for them, it should include (for their suite, say Clubs) two each of the cards numbered 5,6,7,8 and 9.  Shuffle those together, and each player draws two, forming their own private starting hand (just two cards).  All of the rest of the cards (eight for each player) are all shuffled together and put into an initiative deck.  Each player has one marker, used to mark the unit that acted last.  This can be a ring, dice, or some identifiable piece of modeled terrain (a curious stone, for instance), so it looks good on the table, but is still easy to spot.Okay, so play starts by flipping the top card.  Whomever owns the suite of the flipped card has a decision to make.  They can use the card to activate one of their units, or they can take the card into their hand.If they use the card to activate one of their units, they get to act (once) with one of their units.  Whatever the rules allow as a single action (move, shoot, move & shoot, recover, reload, etc. - each ruleset will be different, but I am currently working on a set of horse and musket era skirmish rules that will work for Swashbucklers, Pirates, Mountain Men, Colonials & Indians, etc.), that unit may perform.  It then gets the \"last moved\" marker placed on it.  When a card is chosen to act on in this way, the unit activated cannot be the one that currently has the \"last moved\" marker on it - thus preventing a unit from acting twice in a row.Once that action is completed, the player may roll 2d6 against the card, if they roll less than, or equal to, the number on the card - then they get to do a follow-on action (with a different unit - again, follow the rule for the \"last moved\" piece).   The same options are available during a follow-on action, as during the initial action for the card.  Once that action is finished, roll again (with a minus 1, although this is cumulative, so next time it will be -2, then -3, etc).  The player could keep acting, and can even use the same unit more than once, as long as it is not consecutively, as long as they keep making their dice roll.Now, at any time, another player may play a card from in their hand.  It cannot be done after an action as started, or after a dice roll has successfully been made for a follow-on action, but it can be played at any other time.  In order to avoid confusion and mistake, it is polite for the acting player to see if someone wants to play a card before they take an action, or roll to take a follow-on action.Now, another player can play a card to interrupt.  They have to play a card out of their hand.  Once they do, the interrupting player now has to roll against their own card.  If successful, the place the original card in the discard pile, and the owning player now begins an action with one of their units.  Follow-on actions can follow the first.  This player can now be interrupted by another player (or the original) with one of their own cards.If the interrupting player fails their dice roll to interrupt, then they lose their card (to the discard pile), and it is up to the original player to do their action (although multiple people can attempt to interrupt).  In the case of a failure, then the original actor has the opportunity to do their next action (whether initial, or follow-on) with the unit that is still marked with the \"last moved\" marker - so in the case of a failed attempt at an interrupt, the last unit that moved, can be the next unit that moves.If the interrupt is successful, then the interrupted player loses the card they were playing off of (to the discount pile) and they are finished.  They could play another interrupt card against the player that just interrupted them.  And so on.I will have to try this out in a game.  Ideally it should be a game where the players get a handful or more of units or characters.I am looking forward to it, and will report back with results.Okay, working with the encounter chart posted last week, I started to flesh out some of the organizations, and so on, that might come up on the different entries.  I will begin presenting those, and then collate them into the overall encounter chart.First, one of the things that comes up a few times is the idea of a Pirate. Towards that end, I created a few tables for randomizing Pirates operating in and near Sphere Fenix.Pirates!Several tables are required for generating a pirate encounter. First, decide if it is a (1-3) single pirate ship, or (4-6) pirate organization.  Then roll on the following tables.

Honer Unk is an Exotic, a curious development of mankind that has adapted, physically, to living in low, and artificial, gravities.  His muscles have atrophied, but he has AI enhancements to his mind.Tingu Ferraeowl commands a mixed crew of Aslan and Human.The Antique Trader is in the Mongoose supplement, \"Merchants and Cruisers\", and all of the other classes (except the Corsair) are from \"Traders and Gunboats\". These are all dangerous criminals, who have taken to piracy for a variety of different reasons, but typically they all have ships with large (over-berthed) crews, for the purpose of taking prizes and manning them.  Having extra crew helps in raids and boarding actions as well.  These ships are also larger than most typical adventure class ships (usually in the 100-200 ton range), and as is typical of Pirates, have all sorts of camouflage enhancements, like duplicate transponders, and minor cosmetic changes to the hulls (performed with a minimum effort, and short amount of time) - as described for the standard 400t Pirate Corsair.Next we'll take a look at some common pirate organizations.  These are more complex, larger operations than the individual pirates listed above.  Each of these organizations is like a corporation, or mercenary company.  They have rules governing membership some hierarchy of leaders; armed ships, warehouses, and other equipment; arrangements with local government; and finally some planetary base (one or more).

{"title": "Traveller Tuesdays - Space Encounters in Sphere Fenix (1)", "date": "Tuesday, November 6, 2012", "text": "As a place to start in looking at the Sphere Fenix star nation of the Crucis Margin sector, I decided to start with encounter tables.  This is a great way to inject some basic sandbox material.  The idea is simple, take a basic encounter table, and then provide details for many of the entries that are specific to the campaign being run.As this column assumes the Mongoose interpretation of Classic Traveller, we can start by taking a look at the random space encounter tables from that rule book.This is a table that goes from 01 to 96 (a total of 60 entries, derived from reading two dice as two sets of digits).  The numbers below 11 and above 66 are achievable by a sequence of modifiers that apply to the first die in the sequence.  Those modifiers can range from -1 to +3 (modifications outside that range are truncated down or up, as appropriate).  Then read the following table:Consult the Mongoose book for the modifiers.Some of these entries - 02 Solar Flare 03 Asteroid 04 Ore Bearing Asteroid  14 Comet 23 Micrometeorite Store 32 Space Junk (possible...)Are \"terrain\" or objects that belong to the environment, rather than sophont-made (man-made?) objects (with the possible exception of Space Junk, depending on what it is...).Now, taking a look at the rest of the chart, the many man-made objects all have a sort of implication about where they might be appropriate, if a referee were to start putting in specific information.  That specific information could include (1) ships (either specific Classes or types, or specific named Ships), (2) NPCs (which includes, but is not limited to, patrons, enemies, rivals, contacts, etc), or (3) Organizations (mercenary companies, mega corps, pirate cartels, religions, alien cultures).In order to make things simple, we can identify each of these as being appropriate for a certain level of scoping for the campaign - if specific detail on the chart is desired.  That detail can be (1) Quadrant or Sector level, (2) Polity or Sub-sector level, or (3) Planet or World System level.  This gives us a road map to determine which specific NPCs or Ships need to be referenced.Take a look at the chart, split out to a single column, with each entry having a flag indicating if specifics for that entry would get their information from a resolution appropriate to Quadrant/Sector level (QS), Polity/Sub-sector level (SS), or Planet/World System level (WS).  In addition, if the encounter aims itself at a named Ship (type or instance), a named NPC, or a named Organization is identified as a second flag.01 Alien derelict (possible salvage) (QS) (Ship)02 Solar flare are (1d6 100 rads)  (WS)03 Asteroid (empty rock) (WS)04 Ore-bearing asteroid (possible mining) (WS)05 Alien vessel (on a mission) (QS) (Ship)06 Rock hermit (inhabited rock) (WS) (NPC)11 Pirate (SS) (NPC) (Org?)

{"title": "Theremin Thursdays - Conan, Basil, and Gaming", "date": "Friday, November 2, 2012", "text": "One of the best soundtracks from a fantasy movie, in the opinion of GwC HQ staff, is the soundtrack for the original 1982 Conan the Barbarian Movie.  The soundtrack is by Basil Poledouris. \"Know, O Prince, that between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the rise of the Sons of Aryas, there was an Age undreamed of, when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world like blue mantles beneath the stars - Nemedia, Ophir, Brythunia, Hyperborea, Zamora with its dark-haired women and towers of spider-haunted mystery, Zingara with its chivalry, Koth that bordered the pastoral lands of Shem, Stygia with its shadow-guarded tombs, Hyrkania whose riders wore steel and silk and gold.  But the proudest kingdom of the world was Aquilonia, reigning supreme in the dreaming west.Hither came Conan the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the earth under his sandled feet.\" - The Nemedian ChroniclesThe movie was an effort to capture the feel of the fantastic Robert E. Howard stories (and the many writers who have contributed to the ongoing Hyborian Age stories, some good some bad).  It is not based on any one particular Howard story, but it does try to capture the feel and look of the setting for the stories, and there are some parts of it that are very true to the character of Conan, and some parts not so much...  But in this article we are concerned with the music from the movie, and the presence of Conan (and his world) in gaming.The soundtrack was written by Basil Poledouris.  And it is great.  It was listed by AFI as one of the top 250 soundtracks of all time (I don't know what number it is).  The music has a sort of archaic feel to it, with a sort of alien-ness, or foriegn-ness.  Almost a pseudo-eastern influence.  And it is wonderful -stirring stuff, and perfect for an adventure film.  The Hyborian Age world is supposed to be our world, only ages before any history that we have recorded to us.  As such, the main lands feature a sort of Africa/Europe/Asia super continent, sort of a midpoint between Pangea and today's continental shapes.For gaming, this is great because it retains some sense of familiarity, but is different enough so that many different narratives can take place within the setting, without it starting to feel \"wrong\".Howard, in his stories, and in his fantastic essay (which lays out the history of the world) called \"They Hyborian Age\" gave a lot of details about the countries, cultures and peoples.  And many of them have historical approximations in our own real world history - again, this is very useful for gaming.  It makes finding similarities easy - to get a grip on equipment, military capability, finding miniatures for different countries, and so on.Before going on with the Gaming, here is one more music clip.  This is Basil Poledouris, in 2006 (only a few months before he passed away) conducting the Andalucian Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus.  There are two pieces of music here - the Anvil of Crom (wow - grab a broadsword and join the fray!), and then the Riddle of Steel leading into the Riders of Doom (that second piece will certainly evoke images of \"Zamora with its dark-haired women and towers of spider-haunted mystery\" if you allow it to).  Evidently, this is the only time that Boledouris performed a live concert of the soundtrack pieces.That was part one of the symphony production, there is also Part 2 (Gift of Fury, the Atlantean Sword, and the Love Theme), Part 3 (Funeral Pyre and the Battle at the Mounds) and Part 4 (The Orphans of Doom, and The Awakening).  This was then followed up by an encore presentation of the Anvil of Crom (again - but really, who can get enough?), Part 5. There is no shortage of information available online about Conan and his world.  For starters, once could do worse than consulting the Conan Wiki.  It has information about the many stories and novels (by Howard, and others); the tons of fantastic Conan comics that were done, both by Marvel and the more recent masterpieces by Dark Horse, and others.  It even has a (incomplete) listing of some games - both tabletop RPG and also Computer - that feature Conan. Conan and his world (also the world of Red Sonja, thank you very much) have been a part of the world of gaming since the 1950s and 60s.  In Tony Bath's legendary Hyborian Campaign, the nations of the Hyborian Age were the nations that wargamers were rulers of, and they would fight out their battles using miniatures.  Tony's rules date to 1956, and they were published in a Don Featherstone book in 1962 - these rules were all for the Hyborian Campaign.  There is a nice series of articles about many aspecits of this campaign over at the Hill Cantons blog (Part 2, Part 3 and Part 4) that makes the (very good) case that although it wasn't called a \"roleplaying game\" that by the end of the campaign, that is very much what it became.  Or at least it became what the early days of Arneson and Gygax were running, when they morphed medieval campaign wargaming into the early states of roleplaying. I believe a strong case can be made that so many miniatures rules sets for the pre-gunpowder world treat the whole milieu (from Bronze Age chariotry up through High Chivalry of the 14th and 15th century) as one ruleset, owes to the work that Tony Bath (and later Wargames Research Group) started with his Hyborian campaign. For original material from Tony Bath, check out Rudi Geudens' website on the subject.In 1975, Fantasy Games Unlimited (FGU) published a set of miniatures rules for fighting out battles between the various nations of Hyboria.  It was titled \"Royal Armies of the Hyborean Age\", and was written by Scott Bizar (of FGU) and Lin Carter (fantasy author, and writer of some Conan stories).  It had some very nice information on the countries - military makeup, some background information, and even info on the uniforms (if any) and national battle standards.  It was (and remains) a great little miniatures game, based on FGU's Medieval miniatures rules, Broadsword (with the \"Hyborean\" er, Hyborian rules adding in things like Elephants and Chariots, for nations such as Vendhya and Stygia that employ such weaponry).  There were never specific miniatures for the Hyborian Age produced at the time, but there was a line of knock offs.  Minifigs produced a line of miniatures called \"Swords and Sorcery\".  There is a catalog listing over at The Stuff of Legends.  It was a pretty typical mid-70s fantasy line, but with a lot of soldiery based on the nations of both the Carter/Bizar book, and the Howard (and others') novels.  The names were changed to protect Minifigs, so instead of Hyrkanians, for instance, you get \"Hyrkranians\".  Instead of Vendhya Warriors, you get \"Vandan\" Warriors - \"Zampora\" in lieu of Zamora, etc.Move forward to 1985, and enter a world where there are a lot of computer games being hosted on computers, where the players would mail in commands to the referee (or company), and these would be entered into a campaign management system, and the results would be produced and sent back out to the player.  There was a Conan based game at this time that was immensely popular - Hyborian War.  You would choose a Small, Medium or Large country, and then you would have to write regular orders for that country - it's developments, economic and cultural; it's military movements; and the actions of any leaders or heroes associate with it.  The computer would generate the results.  There is a website with Lots of the Hyborian War data available on it, today, and a lot of it is very interesting to a gamer (wargamer or otherwise).  Just check out the details on the kingdoms here.In 1984, following the movie from 1982, TSR published two Conan based modules for the basic Dungeons and Dragons game.  Module CB1 was \"Conan Unchained\" and Module CB2 was \"Conan against the Darkness\".  They were pretty bad.  Nobody loved them, not even Conan fans.There was a series of GURPS books on Conan, the first one (GURPS Conan) having an introduction written by L. Sprague DeCamp (who wrote a LOT of Conan stuff, and is either adored or despised by Howard fans, depending on whether they view him as a loving fan, or a despoiling pirate).  Their stuff consisted of a basic book on the world, and building characters, and then a handful of (well written) adventures.  Much better, IMHO, than the TSR stuff for Basic D&D.For Roleplaying, however, by far the best and most voluminous effort has been by Mongoose Publishing, for their Conan the Roleplaying Game (both 1st and 2nd edition).  Loads of settings books (kingdoms, cultures, etc) and a lot of adventure material.  To compliment the RPG, they have also been (although this may have been halted) working on a set of Skirmish miniatures rules. Mongoose officially ended the Conan line, but many of the products are available.In boardgaming, Conan has existed for a long time. First, during the hayday of play-by-mail Diplomacy games (60s, 70s), it seemed like there were a half dozen different Conan variants (using maps and countries, as described again in Howard's Hyborian Age).  Some of these had more or fewer special rules to give the game a more \"Conan-like\" feel.More modernly, there has been a great design from Fantasy Flight games, with their 2009 game Age of Conan.  This is a really good looking (I haven't played it yet, but I plan to soon - and I will write a review for Gaming with Chuck).  It is for 2-4 players, with the players running the nations of Aquilonia, Turan, Hyperborea and Stygia.  There is a great map, and really good looking pieces.  BoardGameGeek rates it as a respectable 6.76 out of 10.By the entry information at BGG it is a 90 minute game.  Not bad for a four person strategic wargame, even one in a fantasy world.  Here is a copy of the Overview of the game, from BGG:In Age of Conan, you control one of the major kingdoms of the Hyborian Age – Aquilonia, Turan, Hyperborea and Stygia.You will build up and use your armies and emissaries, you will enhance your actions with your kingdom cards, and you will try to take advantage of the adventures of Conan to increase the power and wealth of your kingdom.The game is played over the course of three ages. At the beginning of each age, four Conan adventure cards are drawn and used to create the adventure deck. At the beginning of each adventure, players will bid to decide who will be the Conan player for that adventure; when an adventure ends, a new one is drawn and a new bid determines who will be the new Conan player.The roll of the fate dice is used to determine the actions available to the players. The dice are rolled to form a common pool from which all players will pick their dice. Each player, in turn, will choose and use one fate die and will be able to do one of the actions allowed by that die result.When the fate dice are all used, they are rolled again and the game continues in this way until all four adventures in the adventure deck are complete. At that point, the game will temporarily stop so that players may earn gold and take several kingdom–building actions in preparation for the next age.In 1981, in issue number 37 of Space Gamer, Lewis Pulsipher published a set of rules, and a map, for Hyborian Risk.  A few special rules, and the map.  Interesting, I wonder if it would catch on today?There are also a couple of successful Conan card games.  First, there was a Conan collectible card game from Tempo Games (2006).  But, perhaps more wide reaching, in 2011 there was a Munchkin: Conan base set released, after an individual pack that contained a few Conan themed cards for the main game.  With the Juggernaut of gaming that the Munchkin franchise has become for Steve Jackson Games, I suspect it will be the much-more-successful of the two card games listed here.Last, the modern wargaming miniature rules from WRG, DBA (De Bellis Antiquatis) and HOTT (Hordes of the Things) have both had versions of the Hyborian World nations written up as army lists - with lists of the various troop types that would make up the armies.  Who knows, maybe one of these days Gaming with Chuck staff might actually run a Hyborian campaign, a la Tony Bath style.  Who knows?"},
{"title": "Wargame Wednesdays - Chartless Combat", "date": "Wednesday, October 31, 2012", "text": "Wargame Wednesdays this week will follow up last week's discussion of the CRT with an overview of some of the combat systems used in board wargames, that don't rely on a combat chart.I would like to investigate a few of these, starting with a game that *is* a wargame, albeit a rather simplistic one.  Risk (rules available here). Staff and Friends of Gaming with Chuck enjoy a game of Lord of the Rings RiskRisk, in all its many forms, consists of simply applying strength to the map (in the form of placing or moving armies), and then trying to use your \"strength\" to overpower that of your opponents.  There is a nice collection of the many different variants of Risk, linked to from the Board Game Geek entry on the original 1959 game. This is done by a simple combat mechanism that relies on compared dice rolls.  For the 2 persons in the world who might be reading a gaming blog, but for whom Risk has never happened, it works like this:  The active player has armies in a number of territories on the map.  On his turn, he can direct as many armies, from a territory, as he likes (except 1 - he must always leave at least 1 army in a territory), into an adjacent territory that has enemy armies in it.  The attack is then played out in rounds, until either one side or the other is eliminated, or the attacker calls off the attack.  The attacker may roll up to 3 dice, but never more than one dice per attacking army (of course, he had to leave behind at least one to garrison the territory he moved from).  The defender may roll up to 2 dice, but never more dice than he has armies defending the territory.  Then the dice are compared - the highest dice are compared first, then the second highest (if each side rolled at least 2).   The comparison is simple - highest roll wins, with a tied roll going to the defender.  The loser in this comparison loses an army.  Simple.  Elegant.  And, unfortunately, without a lot of room for modification.  There are variants of Risk that allow re-rolls, and those that allow for additional dice (but never more than the number of armies you have to lose), and those that allow bonuses to be applied to your own dice, and minuses to be applied to your opponents dice, but that is about it.  We will call this mechanism the \"opposed dice roll\" mechanism.War at Sea from Avalon Hill (1975) is a multiple dice mechanism, but it is not an opposed dice mechanism.  Rather, each unit in War at Sea has two combat factors - Offense and Defense.  The Offense factor represents the number of dice that the unit would roll in combat against a target.  Each 6 inflicts damage, and each 5 inflicts disruption.  Each 6 rolled entitles the shooter to roll another d6 to see how much damage is done.  The Defense factor is how many damage points a target has.  Whenever a ship takes a Disruption result, at the end of the current combat round, it must return to a friendly port (at which point the Disruption marker is removed, but the ship is out of combat).  All 6s are resolved before 5s, so the ship will accumulate all damage from all shooters shooting against it in a current round (to see if it is sunk) before checking to see if it is disrupted and needs to return to port.  The combat is played in rounds - first the defender choosing which targets all of his shooters (which can be ships, air squadrons, or submarine) will shoot at.  Prior to the first round, there is a special round of ASW where all ships that can defend against submarines get to shoot at incoming submarines.  But the mechanism for rolling for, and determining hits/damage is the same. This technique can be called the \"dice against target value\" mechanism.  There are a lot of possible modifications that can be worked with this mechanism, such as altering the number of dice that a unit can roll (which happens in War At Sea, based on damage), or altering the target number that must be rolled.  The defense value of a target (which determines how many hits a unit can absorb before destruction, or in the case of War at Sea, how much damage, resulting from hits) can be modified.  So, even though this is, in some ways, a simpler mechanism than the opposed dice roll mechanism (simpler in that all dice rolls are against a single, static target value, or set of target values, rather than being at the shifting target of another dice roll), the fact that each unit has multiple factors (attack and defense), as well as the static target numbers, means that there can be more nuance and alteration representing shifting states in the combat.In 1981, Frank Chadwick had a great (and to this day, still widely played) game design called \"A House Divided\" which also uses a chartless combat system.  There were a number of follow on designs (all published by GDW) that came after A House Divided (1981), including Soldier King (1982) and Attack in the Ardennes (1982), that used slight variations of the same system.  In this system, each unit has a basic combat value.  When it is attacking, it rolls a dice.  If the dice comes up equal to or less than the combat value, then a hit is scored on the enemy unit.  The combats are played in rounds, with the defender going first each round, and units being applied evenly before doubling up, but that is it.  Assign a unit, roll one dice, if it is less than your target number, you cause a hit.  Each game has different units that can take 1 or more hits, so the results of being hit vary with unit type.  Typically, when a unit is hit, it is reduced to a damaged state, and it's combat factor is reduced as well.  Some units (such as armor units in the Attack in the Ardennes game) have modifiers that are applied to the combat factor of those shooting against them (representing either large units, or in the case of tanks, heavy armor).New version of A House Divided, showing Blue vs Grey on custom stands - the combat number for each unit can be seen, this is the target number for the dice throw to determine hits on the enemy. We can see that this system is also a \"dice against a target value\" system, but we will differentiate between this system, and that of War at Sea.  The difference is this - War at Sea has a \"multiple dice against a target value\" mechanism and House Divided has a \"single dice against a target value\" mechanism.This system allows for changes in the target number based on situation (for instance, against a heavy unit that as a modifier for it's enemies; against a unit in a defended area like a trenchline; or while making a hasty attack, like infantry vs cavalry, or across a river, or in bad weather, etc), and allows for different types of unit degradation by having specific values that a *hit* unit reduces to.  But that is it - not as many types of modification as with the \"multiple dice against a target value\", mostly because one of the variables - the number of dice - has been removed.A  brief mention should be made of the wide family of Axis and Allies games (designed by Larry Harris, and first published in 1981 by Nova Games - the same year as A House Divided).  Again, these are often considered \"simple\" wargames by the hex-and-counter crowd (and they are, comparatively speaking), but they are also based on a \"single dice against a target value\" as with the Frank Chadwick system.  The biggest difference is in the complexity of the interaction between units and the map - there is a lot of detail and nuance in the Chadwick designs (and all the games that have come after them, there are a number from modern publishers), and the interaction between units and the map in the Axis and Allies family of games (which is very, very simple in comparison). A notable difference is that in Axis and Allies, and it's derived other titles, each unit as a target number based on whether it is on Offense or Defense.  On Defense, for instance, both Infantry and Armor units are trying to roll for the same target number, but on Offense, the target number for Armor allows for twice as many kills as an Infantry unit on Offense.  And so on for all the unit types.Combat chart for Axis and Allies showing different target numbers for offense and defense.As a further development of the \"multiple dice against a target value\" mechanism, there is a whole family of games, championed primarily these days by Columbia Games, but also frequently by other companies, especially GMT.  These are called, collectively, Block Games.  In this mechanism, a wooden block represents a military unit, and it stands up so it's current status and parameter level is only visible to the player owning the unit (typically).  When the unit gets into combat, it is laid down, as is the opposing unit(s), and both players can see the parameters.  The blocks are square, and have multiple values on them, based on damage levels to the unit, and the blocks can be rotated, the current state being the values on the side facing up when it is standing and facing the owning player.  These games frequently use multiple dice per unit, based on the damage state of the unit.  A full strength infantry unit, for instance, may have 4 strength points - meaning it could roll 4 dice in combat.  It would have a target number, which might be modified by the situation (terrain, type of attack, etc) or by the nature of the target unit.  An older design that uses this variation of the \"multiple dice against a target value\" mechanism is Napoleon: The Waterloo Campaign, 1815, available from Columbia these days, but years ago it was available through Avalon Hill.  Originally the game was out from Gamma Two, but they became Columbia.Obviously a solo game, as all of the units for both sides (French, and also British/Prussian) are facing the same way.  But the strength markers - dots - can be seen on the outside edge of each block, with the unit type represented by the symbol in the middle.The interesting thing that is presented with the block games version of \"Multiple Dice against a Target Value\" is the attrition effect on the dice thrown.  And the (typically) mechanism for re-acquiring lost dice, through repair (reconstitution) of the units.  The types of modifications to the dice thrown and target numbers are very similar to other types of games using this mechanism, with the additional feature of the combat attrition affecting the dice thrown.  Earlier articles covered a variety of different block games and their mechanisms in Blocks of War I: Hellenes by GMT and then Blocks of War II: Wizard Kings.The final variation on \"Multiple Dice against a Target Value\" is the alternative to the Block games from Richard Borg, the Command and Colors family of games.  In these games, each unit has a number of dice that it rolls (that, typically, is not affected by attrition), and each type of unit determines the results of the dice - which are varied and based on special dice, with special symbols indicating hits, retreats, morale effects, and so on.  The number of dice in these titles is modified by terrain, and sometimes by range, but not by the hits on the parent unit.  The dice results available are modified by situation (you can case a hit on a Sword in close combat, but not in missile combat), or by target type (Red Infantry Units ignore Sword hits), or by formation (if the target unit has two adjacent friendly units, it ignores the first Flag result).  So by using different symbols, for different results, a very varied, but nuanced to simulate the types of combat involved in the particular game, results.  This series of games, and the dice and their results was covered in an earlier article called Blocks of War III: C and C Ancients: Part 1, the Dice of War.  Since that time, Command and Colors: Napoleonics has been released.  Excellent game, but I think that my favorite in the series is still torn between Memoir: 44 and Ancients.That's it for now on chartless combat.  I tried to move from Risk (a simple game, but with an opposed dice mechanism) up through a number of others, both easy and complex.  I tried to end covering a wide variety of Block games and eventually the Command and Colors series.Next week on Wargame Wednesdays, a number of reviews of some excellent games from publishers in Virginia.In deciding to concentrate these postings on the Crucis Margin sector, a little bit of overview might be useful, for anyone interested in following along.The publication of the Crucis Margin sector has a little bit of a history to it.  It was written by Dave Sering, and originally published by Judges Guild, as part of their licensed Gateway Quadrant.  They licensed, from GDW, the rights to develop a quadrant of four sectors (Ley Sector, Crucis Margin, Glimmerdrift Reaches, and Marantha-Alkahest).  These were published, along with nearly 2 dozen other products (mostly adventures) set in these sectors.  You can get a pdf of the original product from RPGnow.Then along came Joe Fugate from Digest Group.  He created a computer generated listing of all the sectors in the GDW Traveller Universe's known space.  Some years earlier, the Judges Guild license had expired.  Many GMs still considered the JG data to be \"canonical\" (and it still is, in My Traveller Universe - MTU).  But while Joe preserved the data from Ley Sector and Marantha-Alkahest (which has been renamed the Gateway sector), he changed the data for Crucis Margin and the Glimmerdrift Reaches. One of the things about this that has always bothered me, was that the political entities in the JG products matched the borders that were drawn in the Keith Brothers supplied map of known space from the original Library Data supplements for classic traveller.  If you look at the website Traveller Maps, you can see at the low resolution map of known space, those original political entities.  But if you zoom in on the detailed view of Crucis Margin and Glimmerdrift Reaches, you see that it was totally changed by Fugate's work.  It is a pity that it became the \"canonical\" version, copyrighted by both Digest Group and GDW.  Fast forward.... A few years back, there was a D20 version of Traveller published.  I ran it for a while - it was okay, I just didn't love the D20 system well enough to give up the traditional Traveller system.  Anyway, the publisher put out a great book on the Gateway sectors - but it was based on the changes that Joe made.  The product, called Gateway to Destiny, is nevertheless quite impressive. So while it is a fantastic supplement, and has all sorts of great data in it, it does not preserve the original Judges Guild data on Crucis Margin.Enough with the publishing history.  This is the beginning of a new weekly column for Gaming with Chuck.  Presenting and expanding on the original Judges Guild information is where this column is headed.  I plan to release a variety of data, in weekly dumps, on the Crucis Margin sector.There are some web sites that deal with the Judges Guild version of the Crucis Margin sector.  Most inspiringly, is Jeff Rients' Gateway Quadrant wiki.  Lots of articles and \"library data\" on the worlds, polities, races and so on in the Quadrant, including all of Crucis Margin.The Zho Base website has a really nice sector data presentation.Finally, Joffre Horlor in New Zealand has an equally impressive presentation of the data for the sector.All of this is a presentation variation (and a modernization of the maps, especially in the case of Joffre's website) of the material that first came in the guidebook from the Judge's Guild product.  Along with the guidebook, that product also came with a poster sized map of the sector.  I still have mine *somewhere* but not sure where.  Still, the many digital versions of the data that are available today are fine with me.The first place to begin is the spinward-coreward quadrant of the Sector (for an intro to galactic directions, see this article).  This contains four subsectors, the two most coreward are Ark, and Negoiul.  The two immediately rimward of them are Mandin and Olsztyn.  Of these, we will present Ark first.Here is a listing of the 27 worlds that make up the Ark Subsector.Aiwo          0101 D685745-5    Ag                 702 NaBoe           0103 B897896-A                       101 NaAcier         0106 EAC4352-9    Ni                 820 NaYaren         0109 B4746B7-A    Ag                 310 NaBaiti         0202 B475436-C  S Ni                 620 SxAnetan        0204 C663759-B    Ri                 603 SxNauru         0206 C499454-A    Ni                 200 SxMasinloc      0209 D520313-A    De                 501 NaNibok         0302 C354888-B                       110 SxMasyaf        0304 E756425-7    Ni                 902 SxGali          0306 D797543-9    Ag                 703 SxKoniek        0308 C567782-D    Ag Ri              100 SxEtzina        0401 A454979-E  N                    110 SxNashchaug     0503 D000353-C    As                 914 SxBuada         0505 B232411-E  N Ni Po              110 SxTasmilma      0507 C768646-A    Ag Ri              100 SxArket         0508 A886989-E  N                    120 SxVryheid       0510 C400310-D  S Ro                 605 SxUaboe         0601 C965669-A    Ag                 110 Sx     fMartre        0606 C343689-B    Ni Po              100 SxEwa           0702 A200789-D    Va                 103 Sx     fAbricot       0704 A97A899-E    Wa                 700 SxBabia         0707 E554173-8    Ni Po              800 SxMalini        0709 B86A989-B    Wa                 110 SxAldrin        0804 E000453-A    As                 203 SxGenk          0807 C66A969-B    Wa                 700 SxDjebeha       0810 B400682-C    Ro                 115 SxThis is a typical subsector listing, presenting the Name of the planet first.  The next column (four digit number) is the Hexagon number on the sector map.  The next column is the very important Universal World Profile (UWP), which lists, in order:Starport typePlanetary SizeAtmosphereHydrospherePopulationGovernmentLaw LevelTech LevelA nice article describing the UWP, along with links to definitions for each of these statistics, can be found at the Traveller Wiki.The next column lists whether a Scout base (S), Naval base (N), or Both (2) is present.  Following that are trade codes, important for trade.Next up is the three digit code describing some world specifics.  The first digit is the Population multiplier.  The UWP Population code gives the base 10 value for the population (for instance Genk/0807 has a population code of 9 - which means 10 to the 9th power.  It's population multiplier is 7, which means that the population of the Genk/0807 system is approximately 7 x 109 or 7,000,000,000 (seven billion) people, throughout the system.   The second digit is the number of Asteroid or Planetoid belts in the system.  The third digit is the number of Gas Giants in the system (very important, for frontier refueling).Genk/0807 is slightly smaller than Earth, with a size code of 6 representing a mainworld planetary diameter in the range of 8,800-10,399 km (which, assuming a standard Earth-like density, suggests a slightly lower gravity).The atmospheric code of 6 indicates a Standard, human breathable atmosphere (no specific taints or pollutants on a broad basis).The hydrosphere has a code of A, or 95%+ of the surface of the mainworld being covered by water.Further examination shows that there is a Tech Level of B, which is \"Average Stellar\" - meaning a society and economic base that is quite comfortable not only with space technology, but with starships and stardrives.  It is quite probably that there are all sorts of bases and colonies spread throughout the Genk/0807 system.From looking at their UWP code for Government, we see that it is a type 6, which represents a captive (or colonial) government.  It would be up to the Referee to determine the story behind this government, but a reasonable glance at the subsector reveals that Genk/0807 is near Malini/0709.  They are both planets in the interstellar government of Sphere Fenix.  It is likely that Malini (or one of the government bureau on Malini) has conquered Genk, and treats it as a colony, or some sort of captive client world.  That Malini only has a population of 1 billion, and Genk has 7 billions is interesting.  Malini is also a water world, same tech level (B), but a better Starport, indicating a better starship manufacturing and support facility.  That Malini has a government that is a civil-service bureaucracy makes the possibility very interesting.Finally, looking at the Law Level for Genk (a 9) it is quite a strict, and harshly controlled society.  Perhaps a Prison planet?  But it does have the same Law Level, for instance, as Malini - which is being considered as the patron world for Genk.The final column gives the political affiliation.  Most of the planets in the Ark subsector are in Sphere Fenix, but some of the planets are unaffiliated.  From the original Judges Guild write up, we know this about Sphere Fenix -Sphere Fenix was original settled by a very diverse group of refugees from the collapsing First Imperium. During the Long Night, these fugitives flourished into a series of mini-states. About 500 Imperial dating, a series of small but bitter wars broke out. In 724, the three surviving states declared peace on each other and met to discuss unification. Though the precise details of governmental structure took over 28 years to develop, Sphere Fenix dates its birth from that meeting. Though internal unrest has occurred since, the overall prosperity has continued to increase. A mutual defense treaty was signed with Ramayan in the 8th century Imperial. Technical assistance is received from Imperium military services and Imperial security is rumored to have great influence. In spite of having fought in no major wars in centuries, military prowess is high and it has become traditional to serve a term or two as a mercenary in one of the surrounding sectors, especially the Marlan Primate.Writeups like these on the worlds of Ark will follow, at least the interesting worlds.  Along with it, I intend to publish details on Patrons, Ships, Locations and Missions.  Hopefully it will be fun."},

{"title": "Theremin Thursdays - Edgar Allan Poe in Music and Gaming", "date": "Thursday, October 25, 2012", "text": "Considering that Halloween is less than a week away, a very fitting topic for a posting on Music and Gaming is certainly music inspired by Edgar Allan Poe and his wonderful stories.There is, evidently, a VERY LARGE body of work that has been inspired by Poe, which shouldn't be too surprising considering how well his writing has stood up to time, and seems to have universal appeal.The one contribution to Poe-esque music that we'll discuss here at Gaming with Chuck is the phenomenal album from Alan Parson's Project, Tales of Mystery and Imagination.  This album was first released in 1976, and was APP's first album.  And it is a great album.The tracks on the album are these:A Dream within a Dream (instrumental)The Raven (my personal favorite)The Tell Tale HeartThe Cask of AmontilladoThe System of Dr. Tarr and Professor FetherThe Fall of the House of Usher (in 5 tracks)To One in Paradise There was a later, 1987, release of the album that featured fantastic narration from Orson Welles at the beginning of A Dream within a Dream, and the first track of The Fall of the House of Usher.The favorite track on the album, here at Gaming with Chuck, is The Raven, based on Poe's classic 1845 poem.The poem has a wonderfully eery feel to it, and really drips of all sorts of dark and supernatural tones and themes, but really, it comes down to a Raven that visits a grieving lover, and refuses to give him consolation about the state of his departed lover's soul in the after life.  Creepy enough, but it is in the delivery that Poe makes this story so impactful.As a take-away for gaming, it shows (at least for role playing games) the reliance of imagery and language in order to set a mood/scene for players.  For a look at how artwork and language can set the mood, take a look at this video, of a book on the poem, being read by Christopher Walken.But, this is a posting about music, and so we turn to the Alan Parson's Project rendition - a song if not exactly the poem, certainly borrowing many lines from it, and inspired by the basic idea.Okay, so we have basically an awesome poem.  And an awesome song.  All by Edgar Allan Poe, but how has Poe affected and influenced gaming?Well, one of the main ways, although this may be a little indirect, is that Poe was an incredible influence on H. P. Lovecraft, who has had a huge impact on gaming.  Robert Bloch (yes, the Robert Bloch that wrote the story used for the Alfred Hitchcock movie Psycho, amongst other horror tales) wrote a very interesting comparison of the two men.  Lovecraft was so influenced and respectful of Poe that he even wrote a poem concerning the earlier author, called \"In a Sequester’d Providence Churchyard Where Once Poe Walk’d\" Eternal brood the shadows on this ground,Dreaming of centuries that have gone before;Great elms rise solemnly by slab and mound,Arched high above a hidden world of yore.Round all the scene a light of memory plays,And dead leaves whisper of departed days,Longing for sights and sounds that are no more.Lonely and sad, a specter glides alongAisles where of old his living footsteps fell;No common glance discerns him, though his songPeals down through time with a mysterious spell.Only the few who sorcery’s secret know,Espy amidst these tombs the shade of Poe.Lovecraft's influences on 20th century pop culture and gaming have been great, and picking up in pace in recent years.  First, for gaming, there is the absolute classic role playing game, The Call of Cthulhu, from Chaosium. First released as a box set, written by Sandy Petersen back in 1981, the rules were based on the earlier Chaosium hit, RuneQuest.  The game (CoC) is still in print today, and one of the main authors is still Petersen (now joined by Lynn Willis).  This game produced sort of a gaming empire for Chaosium, although they weren't without financial problems over the year.  They always retained ownership, and kept in print, CoC, however. Over the year dozens and dozens of gaming supplements - new settings, adventures, supplemental rules, etc - were produced by Chaosium, and other (licensed) companies.  One of the most interesting was a setting called Dreamlands, which allowed players to play in a fantasy/horror realm, that is only reachable while in a dream state.  This was based on a sequence of Lovecraft stories, but could be said to be influenced by Poe's Dream within a Dream, amongst other things.Some modern Lovecraft gaming influences must include the games from Fantasy Flight, including a Call of Cthulhu living card game (a card game, where periodic supplements are produced, to be added into the decks of cards the game is based on), as well as a fantastic board game, called Arkham Horror (AH).  AH was originally published by Chaosium, but it has been taken to new heights, including all sorts of marvelous add-ons and supplements, even including painted figures, etc.  Also from Fantasy Flight is the game Elder Sign, which is sort of a faster play, dice game of Arkham Horror.  AH itself feels like a roleplaying campaign, reduced to a 4-6 hour session.Dunwich supplement for Arkham Horror, adding new board, cards, characters, etc.But what about Poe? One of the direct links to gaming, for Poe, is Mystery Rummy #2 - \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\".  This is, of course, based on the excellent story by Poe.  If you have not read it, please, by all means - go read it now before finding out anything else about the game.  It is a detective story, an early example of the type of story referred to as a \"locked room\" story - where the murder takes place in such a way that there is little or no room for a logical explanation.  The story is very much worthwhile as a discovery, and the game features huge spoiler information.  A copy of the full (short) story can be found here.Okay, there is a video review of the game online from the Dice Tower.The game design comes from Mike Fitzgerald, who has done several different games in the series, and one related (but not in the US Game Systems published sequence of card games).  The relate done is Wyatt Earp, another excellent card game.So there you have it - this week's Theremin Thursday - Music and Gaming article.  Fantastic music from Alan Parson's Project, based on Edgar Alan Poe.  Poe was a big influence on Lovecraft - who has been a phenomenal influence on gaming, and there is even a great little card game based directly on one of Poe's short stories.  Enjoy your gaming, and enjoy Halloween."},
{"title": "Wargame Wednesdays - the Combat Results Table", "date": "Wednesday, October 24, 2012", "text": "Another new (weekly) feature here at Gaming with Chuck, will be Wargaming Wednesday.  This, of course, is an effort to get some regular (irregular?) content on the blog related (specifically) to wargaming.  Classic Wargame - \"The Russian Campaign\" by Avalon HillFor a first outing in this venture, I can't think of a better part of modern wargaming to consider, than the Combat Results Table (CRT).  Before considering the effect of the CRT on wargaming, a quick history and overview of how it works (if you don't know).A variety of different 1-6 CRTsThis is a mechanism going back to Von Reisswitz' Krigspiel (1830s), but used specifically in modern wargaming, at least since the early Charles Roberts efforts that lead to the early days of Avalon Hill.  Charles' second outing in design, was Tactics II (1958, the year Avalon Hill was formed) that introduced the Combat Results Table to the modern boardgaming world.  A decent article is available from wikipedia.The typical (at least if we consider the form that is included in so many of the Avalon Hill Classics) form is a table, numbered from 1 to 6 on the left side (referring to the results of a typical 6-sided dice), and the columns from left to right are labeled with odds, typically ranging from those most favorable to the Defender, all the way to the right with those most favorable to the Attacker.  These \"odds\" refer to an expressed ratio that comes from comparing the Combat Strength of the Attacker to the Combat Strength of the Defender.Avalon Hill CRT with a chart (bottom half) allowing odds to be calculated quick and easy, just by comparing modified Attacker's Factor to a modified Defender's FactorAs an example of calculating odds, consider two units (represented in a wargame, of course, as playing pieces) that are engaged in combat.  The attacker has a combat strength of 6, and the defender has a combat strength of 4.  This means that the combat odds are 6 to 4.  This reduces to 3-2, or 1.5 to 1.Unit counters from an updated version of \"The Russian Campaign\"Taking a look at the sample combat results table here, we see that there is not a column the corresponds to 3-2.  In most (typical) cases, the odds round in the favor of the defender, so this would become a 1-1 attack.Looking at the results in the 1-1 column, we see that if the die reads 1,2, or 3 then the results are that the Defender Retreats (results: DR).  If the die reads 4,5, or 6 then the results are that the Attacker Retreats (results: AR).Example CRT from a Simulation Publications Inc. (SPI) gameMost CRTs have their results predicated on the military maxim that to have a decent chance (or expectation) of success, an attacker has to have 3-1 odds.  In the combat table pictured here, we can see that if the combat were a dice roll in the 3-1 odds column, the results would be on a 1, the Defender is Eliminated (results: DE).  On a die roll of 2 through 5, the Defender is required to Retreat (results: DR).  Finally, on a die roll of a 6, each side loses a unit (EE - each eliminate).Okay, so all of these elements - the structure of the table, the fact that the columns are based on numeric odds, the size and nature of the dice, the types of results, the number of results per dice roll.  All these things can change, but basically all of the different types of CRTs result in a table of combat results, with a random (stochastic) factor being introduced by a dice roll (of course, there are dice-less CRTs, but we'll ignore them for now).The fact that a CRT (at least in early form) gave the results of Eliminate, Retreat, or Exchange for either the Attacker or Defender or Both (in the case of Exchange), it meant that if a combat occurred and a unit was affected by it, the WHOLE unit was affected (either eliminated or retreated).  This means combat had a certain discrete granularity - if the units were Battalions, then whole Battalions were either living or dying in combat. Example CRT (or BRT - Battle Results Table) from Chariot Lords (Excalibre Games, 1975), showing the \"whole unit\" effects, but rather than call it \"Eliminate\", here it is called being \"Smote\" to evoke the Biblical Warfare theme.  Below is a separate combat type CRT - detailing Siege results.As games grew more complex, the idea of half units (basically, being able to make change due to losses in combat) came about - which is a much more typical representation (it seems) to real life combat.  No matter how bad a unit does, in MOST situations, it would survive the encounter with some fighting strength.  What this has, as an effect on combat, is that encounters are not so immediately decided, but tend to last a while.  In a lot of cases, this means games give the player the ability to react to results in combat, by moving in reinforcements, withdrawing, etc.Another reaction to CRT based combat was to introduce separate combat factors for Attack and Defense.  This was done, early, in Blitzkrieg from Avalon Hill - Artillery units had high offensive combat values, but basically the same as an Infantry unit for defense.  Very nice, for the mid 1960s.An interesting modification to the basic CRT is to have multiple results per dice roll.  This could be a result to the Attacker and Defender, or a Destroyed result, and Retreat result, for instance.  In cases where aggregated units (companies, battalions, divisions, brigades, etc) are involved, it IS likely that any combat will result in losses to both sides.  This type of CRT result is more nuanced, and definitely reflects the cost to a unit to engage in even a \"successful\" combat.In 1970, PanzerBlitz was published by Avalon Hill, designed by Jim Dunnigan.  This is a game based on small units engaging with each other.  In order to reflect the effects of morale and disruption, the CRT for this game could result in a unit being eliminated, or disrupted.  Since combat was very tactical, the different ranges of the weapon systems involved was represented by allowing attacking units to engage at range.  Each unit had an attack strength, a defense strength, and a range.  Additionally, each weapon system was a different class weapon (armor piercing, high explosive, or infantry), and each unit type was a different class target (armored, soft, or infantry).  Depending on how these weapon and target classes interacted would determine if there was a modifier to the attack strength, before consulting the Combat Results Table.  So, this represents more changes (disrupted, versus destroyed or retreated) (weapon/target pairings resulting in changes to attack factor), to the basic idea of the CRT.  By the way, following up on PanzerBlitz, there were (and still are) a large number of small unit, or individual tank, type games that have a similar CRT mechanism. This even included the highly successful science fiction games of OGRE and G.E.V. from Metagaming (later Steve Jackson Games).OGRE CRT, expanded out to work with either 1d6 or 1d12, showing Disruption (D) and Elimination (E) results for the target unit.Not described yet, but in many games from the beginning, is the effect of terrain on combat, in a combat system based on a CRT.  Often this will come to play in one of two different ways - first, it could be a multiplier or modifier to the defense strength (or combat strength) of the defender.  If they are in, for instance, terrain that makes them hard to acquire, or protects them physically (like in a built up area, or in a fortress), then an increase in their combat strength will likely result in lower odds on the CRT, meaning a reduced chance for effect.  Second, it could result in \"column shift\" effects.  This refers to shifting the column (the odds based column, in most cases) to the left or right, representing reduced or increased chances of dealing significant damage to the defender.PanzerBlitz CRT, along with Terrain Effects, and also elevation, and weapon/target pairing tables.In the days of board wargaming, prior to heavy influence by computerization of the hobby, there was a large percentage of gamers who participated in Play by Mail gaming.  In this situation, each player has a game set up at their own home, and moves are exchanged via mail.  These days it is done via email, or through digital software representing the game, but exchanging turn information digitally.  When done through the mail, there was a requirement to have a combat results table that could be consulted by both sides, and based on some unpredictable (I won't say random) number.  The answer was the stock listings in the newspaper.  The players would agree on a newspaper they would consult.  When they completed a turn, there would be an agreed to sequence of order that the combats would be resolved in.  And there would be an agreed to Stock listing that would be the beginning of the combat.  Each dice roll required in the combat would be based on the final digit in a stock price.  This gave a sequence of numbers (that each player could consult independently), each from 1 to 10.  Of course, then, this required a CRT that was keyed to the random factors being 1-10 rather than the typical 1-6.  Such charts were produced, and Avalon Hill even made them available in \"play by mail\" kits for their popular titles.There are still games (plenty) that get published using a CRT for combat resolution.  However, there have been lots of other mechanisms for doing unit-to-unit combat in the years since Tactics II.  The next article on Wargaming Wednesdays, here at Gaming with Chuck, will detail some of the alternate systems."},
{"title": "Traveller Tuesdays", "date": "Tuesday, October 23, 2012", "text": "I have been wanting to work on some science fiction gaming topics for some time, now, but I have not had the time.  Just recently, as an exercise in practicing some new programming skills, I began writing a simple gaming app.What the project consists of is a way to add system information to a planetary system for Traveller.  It assumes you already have a UWP (Universal World Profile) and then fills in details as per the new Mongoose book on Scouts.This got me thinking, what if I wanted to run sone Traveller?  Would I use an existing setting (Spinward Marches, Vanguard Reaches, Gateway Quadrant)?  Would I generate my own sector (14 Suns)?  Or would I dispense with interstellar travel altogether, and have all the a tion take place in a single super high population system (with lots of planetary, sattelite, and artificial environments that are populated)?After a few days thouts, I think I am going to use the Gateway Quadrant, the Crucis Margin sector in particular, and start developing some settings, patrons, and Amber Zone encounters.  This will probably migrate to a different blog, with announcements here on interesting postings."},
{"title": "Theremin Thursdays", "date": "Friday, October 19, 2012", "text": "So, I have been thinking about starting up some day related themes on Gaming with Chuck, and I believe that Thursdays are a good day (as good as any) to explore music, and the relationship between gaming and music that is inspirational for gaming. So why the Theremin?Well, first, because it is a fascinating and geeky instrument.Second, because it goes so well alliteratively with Thursday.And third, because - it is often (mistakenly) credited as the secret behind the soundtrack of one of the best Science Fiction movies of all time.The movie, of course, is Forbidden Planet.  By all means watch it again, and soon.  The movie really is better than you remember - and responsible for SO MUCH more that comes after it in science fiction in popular media (which includes not only Movies, but Music, RPGs, and Computer Gaming - amongst other things).The soundtrack was done completely as electronica, although not using the Theremin.  The soundtrack for Forbidden Planet was composed and written by Louis and Bebe Barron, and they referred to the revolutionary music as Electronic Tonalities.  This was done largely on scratch built equipment - crude synthesizers hand built by Louis, some 8 years before the first Moog.  But it was not on a Theremin. There is a nice short on youtube talking about the project and the results.Here is a sample of the electronic tonalities from Forbidden Planet - this is a composition inspired by the long forgotten civilization of the ancient Krell.The first (perhaps only?) movie that featured a soundtrack including a Theremin was Spellbound, by Alfred Hitchcock.  A great movie in it's own right, but not nearly so influential (at least at Gaming with Chuck HQ) as Forbidden Planet. Spellbound features the theme of madness - so features art inspired by Salvador Dali, and also the lovely Theremin infused with the orchestral score.Okay, enough about movies, how about gaming?  Well, glad you asked, gentle reader.  There is an interesting theremin composition available that celebrates the music of the Legend of Zelda. Which brings up an excellent segue - There is a great Zelda Medley composition that has been put together and performed by Lindsey Stirling.  Lindsey is a very geeky - and extremely talented - musician.  Here is her Zelda Medley (she plays the violin - incredibly well).An unscientific poll has found that most gamers find Lindsey to be a much cuter Link than Link.In addition to her Zelda Medley, Lindsey has done some other pieces that might be of interest to gamers.  These include:Game of Thrones medleySkyrim theme song Lord of the Rings medleyBefore going on to the gaming connection, it is only right to point out that the instrument that started this conversation - the theremin - has been featured in one of the cultural icon programs of our time - Big Bang Theory.  Here is a clip of Sheldon Cooper playing his theremin (which I think is a Moog Etherwave).Segue - Although Sheldon Cooper was inspired to take up the theremin, it was NOT used in the soundtrack (or theme music) for the original Star Trek series (or any follow on).  It was, however, used in The Day the Earth Stood Still (second best early Robot sci-fi film, after the before mentioned Forbidden Planet).  That movie segues into other conversations related to films and gaming, which we will not pursue here, other than to say Klaatu Barada cough-cough-cough.Okay, the tabletop gaming link to all of this.Well, first of all there is a HUGE impact of classic sci fi on one of my favorite RPGs of all time - classic Traveller.  Available still today, 35 years after its initial release in 1977 (same year as Star Wars).  The current version that is a favorite at Gaming with Chuck is the Mongoose Games reprint, also known in some circles as Riki-Tiki-Traveller.  But when playing a classic Traveller adventure, such as Shadows, or Annic Nova, or Research Station Gamma, you can just hear the theremin music playing in the background.  More on Traveller in postings to follow soon.Okay, Lindsey Stirling was mentioned.  While not at all related to the Theremin, it is music that has a STRONG relation to gaming.  Lets look at her songs.  First there is the Legend of Zelda composition - based on a game series (a very popular one) on a variety of different game platforms.Next is the theme song from Skyrim.  An incredibly popular game, and soon to be the basis for a new MMORPG. The other day, while perusing game books in a book store, I found an impressive \"cheat\" book for Skyrim, located with the RPG books.  I flipped through it - even if you never played the electronic game (on a PC), the amount of material in there could make for a quite impressive table top RPG setting.  Dungeons, background, history, etc etc etc.  Well done.Next up from Lindsey Stirling and Peter Hollen is the Game of Thrones piece that they did.  Impressive, and based on the tv series' that have been on (and no doubt, yet to come).  There are a number of really interesting games out for Game of Thrones, for the tabletop, including a great living card game, and several board games.  One of my favorite is the tactical battles game, Battles of Westeros.  The base game comes with armies, cards, and scenarios for clashes between the Stark family and the Lannister family.  Lots of add-ons expand those two, as well as adding lots of other factions (and armies).  Great looking map, great scenarios, and really nice plastic miniatures.  It is also related to one of my favorite board game designs, which has been covered on Gaming with Chuck before - the Command and Colors games (including Battle Lore). There is also a multi-player game, that covers the power struggles between the different households, as they all struggle to become high king.  Great game, with really nice components, out of print for a while but Fantasy Flight Games recently released a second edition.  This game was designed by Christian Peterson, who does a lot of the designs for Fantasy Flight, and is becoming quite a good game designer (some say, all Ameritrash, but I don't think so - this one title, at least, shows heavy Euro influence).Finally, of course, from Lindsey is her Lord of the Rings medley (she even sings on that one).  Great job, again, and very inspirational.  The number of games influenced by the Lord of the Rings is, of course, too many to number here.  I will mention, however, the FANTASTIC job that Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) did, at one time, of chronicling the man lands and sites of Middle Earth for gaming purposes.  Their guides and modules were aimed primarily at their own Middle Earth Role Playing game (still very good, and very playable), and also their magnum opus Rolemaster (RM). RM started out as an add-on to Dungeons and Dragons, presenting modules that could replace weapon combat (Arms Law), beast and monster combat (Claw Law), and magic (Spell Law).  The first two were later combined into Arm Law/Claw Law.  ICE would go on to produce their own core game, in the book Character Law.  They would add to it, a monster and treasure book (called Creatures and Treasures), and some modules in their own world.  They would eventually produce a much more interesting world, Shadow World.  But the best stuff (hands down) that they ever did for fantasy was the extensive Middle Earth series.  They produced Middle Earth Roleplaying as an introductory version of RM, and suited for more casual gamers.  Many of their products are available as cheap (or sometimes free) PDFs on sites such as Drive Thru RPG, or RPGNow.One of the most fabulous things about many of the Middle Earth products from ICE was the Angus McBride cover art.  Wow.   Other than the Brothers Hildebrandt, I think that Angus McBride inspired me the most in thinking about the visuals of Middle Earth.French Language release of the excellent Middle Earth module, Carolan Without getting into the equally impressive list of Science Fiction games that were based on Star Trek, I will call an end to this article, but tune in again next week for more on Gaming and Music, on Theremin Thursdays, here at Gaming with Chuck.Tags: theramin, music, science fiction, gaming"},

Sure, the stereotype of gamers is weird, out of touch, strange, unwashed, kind of socially backward, etc - you get the idea.  But most that I have known (most, not all) rise above that.  They become quite social.  After all, gaming is basically a social activity - lots of human interaction, and a self organized hierarchical structure emerges in any game, or gaming group.  Of course, they still do retain their own language, culture and mannerisms - but if they can project the social skills into other arenas of life, then (as the article suggests) the fact that they are gamers gives them a leg up.

{"title": "Abulafia Random Generators", "date": "Wednesday, September 19, 2012", "text": "There is an awesome concept housed over at http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Main_PageImagine a wiki page that has a bunch of entries listed on it, and you click on one, and the content at that page is randomized.  Now imagine that the randomization sequence is actually designed to create content suitable for a fantasy RPG.That is what Abulafia has created.  This includes the (very awesome) dungeon overview generator.This works like this -From the main page, chose \"places\" as your category.Next you get a list of the different types of randomly generated \"places you can find.We can chose \"Dungeon Overview\"This now gives us a random history of what and why the dungeon is (or was) all about - which could generate ideas for all sorts of cool flavor and content in the dungeon.Here is a direct link - http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Dungeon_OverviewActivating this (just this one time) gets me the following -The dungeon was originally  a palace  that is  the holy land of  spooky children with psionics but has been forgotten by most civilized races for eons. It was rediscovered due to the recent death of the medusa responsible for the statues from which the surrounding stone was quarried. Near the West entrance, a clay golem of unusual intelligence suspects it may contain a sussurus--one of particular interest--and so has dispatched bewitched innocents into the complex. They communicate via sign language.Meanwhile, a group of righteous goat-headed warriors who entered through a secret door to the Northwest suspects it may contain a werewolf that they value. Their leader is said to be strangely cloned and is also a sinister pet with a dangerous pet--a son of kyuss  that appears to obey his/her every whim. It roams the halls looking for sustenance but is afraid of winter. It's also far more intelligent than the typical member of its species. This group uses a species of creeping vine that records sound to spy on the other group of intruders.(In recent weeks, the two factions have begun to skirmish in the halls.)Unbeknownst to either side, a lamia noble --wielding powerful magic--lives deep within, inside a network of tunnels leading eventually to a pearl which it prizes beyond all things.It has constructed traps around its lair--for example, a sturdy cage ready to close on whatever steps inside --but also two stranger traps, informed by its bizarre alien intelligence, which cause intruders to be destroyed by despair. It can avoid the traps easily because of its unique abilities.The other factions have made about four traps each as well, but they are cruder, since they've been recently and hastily thrown together.In addition, there are many hazards that are the legacy of the dungeon's original inhabitants. No-one has yet discovered the secret passage near the dais on the first level.Due to the subtle influence of a morningstar (behind the scale model on level two) with a powerful curse on it, nearly all of the inhabitants have become increasingly compulsive and some have gained additional bizarre physical and mental deformities. Some have become obsessed with despair for reasons unknown.Perhaps the most disturbing room in the dungeon is the so-called \"Chamber of The Claws\" which the intelligent creatures in the dungeon fear above all else. However, beyond it there is a androgynous half-orc alchemist who hails from the homeland of one of your PCs and may aid him/her, though s/he covets the PCs' (whatever they have that's unusual) and is repulsed by the sight of every piano s/he sees in the dungeon.The dungeon's architecture resembles an overgrown prison, however every stairway in it is made of Aquamarine and Pearl.In addition to these things, it is said by some that, hidden deep within the complex, where no mortal has been in eons is the Child of Despair and the EnigMan, returned from a centuries-long journey beyond the sky, awakening from his slumber to a world gone mad."},

But what about paints.  Is it okay to (permanently) store hobby paints (vallejo; craft store acrylics; artist acrylics; GW paints; etc) in a space that routinely gets into the upper 80s in temperature?

{"title": "Board gaming Night with a New Group in Columbus GA", "date": "Wednesday, August 29, 2012", "text": "So, I was able to attend a board gaming gathering last night at Moxie in Columbus Georgia.  There were a half dozen folks around who got together for this (the first) meeting of what could turn into a regular Tuesday night board gaming group.There was a wide diversity in the back ground, as far as who has played what games, and also a wide diversity in interest in different types of games.The games played last night were Kingsburg and also a five player version of Ticket to Ride.Unfortunately, I got to Moxie late (more about the store in a moment), so wasn't able to play in the Kingsburg game, but it is one of the titles I have been wanting to play for some time now, so maybe I'll get to give it a go in the near future.Kingsburg, set up and box coverThe game that I did get to play, however, was Ticket to Ride.  This was a five player version of the basic (original) game.  Still a great game, and a real challenge with 5 players.  Of course the thing that makes it so much fun with a full round of players is that it is very, very easy to cut someone off, inadvertently. Great fun for everyone except the person being cut off, that is.  And it happened, a couple of times, in the game.  I ended up taking a -21 points from tickets I didn't complete, which from my imperfect memory, and faulty math, seemed like it would have propelled me to victory if I WOULD have been able to complete them.  Oh well, that's why there are other chances to play this classic again.Ticket to Ride, picture of an endgame situation, using 1910 cardsThe place where we met and played was Moxie Paintball.  The person running the shop (I believe he is the Owner) Was Jerry - a great fellow who helped to organize the get-together, and who is also interested in a lot of games, and the one who broke out the Ticket to Ride game.  What a really friendly guy.  He started the paintball business three years ago (and kudos to him for doing so well), and only recently decided to branch out into gaming.  A really nice store, with a small, but already strong - and growing - gaming product collection.  In fact, he had a copy of Small World Underground in stock, and I plan to stop by and pick it up tomorrow.Part of the Gaming selection at Moxie's Paintball, Columbus GAFor those interested, the store is located at 7519 Fortson Road, Columbus, GA (706) 221-6700The group is planning to get together again next Tuesday night for more gaming.  I believe there is talk of a classic Axis and Allies game, and also some lighter Euro game filler.  Should be a good time.  Lots of talk last night about Arkham Horror and other titles - perfecto!"},

He asked me to do a guest lecture on the history of games.  So I did.  And it was a lot of fun.I started out pointing out that in three of the ancient river valley civilizations in the world - the Nile, the Yangtze, and the Mesopotamian valleys - that some of the earliest artifacts we have of civilization include games and gaming equipment.  From there, a brief foray through the use of games to train nobles and the military, including mock combats through history (Roman wargames, Medieval tournaments and melees, drilling, mock combat, etc) along side a history of board games, leading up to the wargaming developments of the 19th century.It was a lot of fun, especially once we got into the 20th century, and starting talking about games as recreation once again.  This led through the introduction of hobby wargames (HG Wells, Fred Jane, Charles Roberts, etc), into roleplaying games, computer gaming, and euro games.A very satisfying lecture.  I wish I could do a whole semester on the subject."},

{"title": "How to Raggify an Adventure", "date": "Wednesday, June 20, 2012", "text": "Over at the blog for the Lamentations of the Flame Princess game (which is a totally awesome re-imagining of classic D&D, with a really nice horror veneer put on top of it), there is a posting titled:\"How to Raggify an Adventure\"These are ways to totally AWESOME-IZE an adventure.I post the author's list below, and if you are either a player or a GM of table top RPGs, you'll realize how hilarious this list is.[by the way, for details on how to get Lamentations of the Flame Princess, visit the author's web store here.]12 ways to creep up some random moldy old module. i.e. roll on this chart to make any adventure more Raggian.﻿Put a Deck of Many Things in the first encounter area.Randomly select an encounter area. Simply replace it with another randomly selected encounter area from a randomly selected other adventure in your collection.Reverse the hit point totals of everything in the adventure (12hp becomes 21, 40hp becomes 4, etc).Randomly select a page in the adventure and begin reading. The next mention of any sort of liquid in the adventure, change it to \"semen.\"Select one monster in the adventure randomly and multiply its hit points by 10. You're not supposed to be able to defeat everything, you know.Replace all of the magic items in the adventure with cursed counterparts.Put so many goddamn warning signs and spooky buildup to the dungeon that the players actually get freaked out and consider just quitting instead of playing the damn game. \"Gorfar the Barbarian will settle for a farming life after all if adventuring means going in places like *that*.\"Insert an old crotchety and harmless NPC into some room (maybe as a prisoner if it's a dungeon adventure) who has no purpose other than telling the PCs how much they suck at adventuring.Go to Metal-Archives.com. Hit \"Random Band.\" The first song title of the first item of the discography is the new name of the most important enemy/monster/NPC in the adventure.The next halfling the PCs encounter in the adventure should be replaced with Elijah Wood's Kevin from Sin City.Turn on the TV right now. The first person you see on the screen? That person is the first NPC you present to the PCs.Everything that's supposed to be hostile in the adventure runs away from the party. When they get to the end of the dungeon, they find it's just been solved/looted by their higher-level future selves who have time traveled back to solve this adventure. They tell the PCs \"Sorry about this, I remember when this happened and it really sucked, but nothing to be done about it. Cheerio!\" and they disappear. All those enemies that ran away have returned to their posts, and this time they won't run.(by the way, I have employed some of these techniques in my game over the years.  If you have played in them, see if you can guess which ones)"},
{"title": "Strange Adventures afoot over at Valley of the Old Ones", "date": "Friday, June 8, 2012", "text": "So, I am in the middle of a \"Week of Adventure Locations\" over at my fantasy roleplaying blog, Valley of the Old Ones.I had been working on an area of my setting that is peopled by a group of viking-like warriors, viewed by the main strain of Humanity as being somewhat barbaric, known as the Storm King tribes (the Storm King is their chief Diety, not at all unlike a mixture of Odin and Thor).  A part of the setting that these tribes inhabit is a great river valley, and they have a number of settlements there, called (collectively) the eight Steadings of the River Jarls.In writing up settings, while I like coming up with an interesting back story, and interesting encounters and characters to populate the setting, I never like to pass up the chance to deposit an adventure location that the players might seek out in the game.  Something that will lead to a more traditional dungeon or other adventure setting, but one that fits in with the background of the area.So, I set for myself the goal of writing up the eight Steadings of the River Jarls within a week, and along with the description of each of the Steadings, I am including an \"Adventure Location\".So far, the first few are finished and the adventure locations are these:The Dungeons of Igo Umblar, half buried under the Ice Father glacier.The thorny portal, a curious open doorway to the Unseely Court, guarded by an unaging elfin maid known as the Princess of Roses.The desolate and abandoned Gnome dungeons under the Tower of Ontigar, at the center of the jewel strewn lifeless lands known as the Scorch.  Fair warning, however, if you go to check out the articles, most of them have to do with the setting (the description of the Steading of the Jarl in question), with the adventure location being the last few paragraphs in the article linked to."},

Loads of great stuff, including the Table Top set of videos by Wil Wheaton.All surprisingly good (and even better if you already like The Guild).  (and who doesn't?) http://www.youtube.com/user/geekandsundry?feature=watch(here is the list to just the Table Top videos - but really, if you have any Geek street cred, you'll wanna watch all of the video series from Geek and Sundry)By the way, this is the 300th posting, so the homage to Miller and Varney's excellent comic up above.  But that also reminds me - the Spartans expansion to Command & Colors is out.  WooHoo!  Something else on the \"must have\" list for GwC staff.Okay - so here it is - an incomplete, imperfect list of two player games that Anita (Mistress of Operations, at Gaming with Chuck headquarters) and I find quite enjoyable.  Minor comments are included, ask about any you find interesting in the comments, and there are links to Boardgamegeek listings for these, so you can read reviews, etc.I purposefully left off any titles that are strictly wargames, although almost all of those are specifically for 2 players.   Here is the list - in no particular order.  I would have listed Ticket to Ride or Lost Cities first, if I was doing them in order that I would recommend.Agricola - yes, latin for Farmer.  Great game.Carcassonne - tons of add-ons and variants, the basic game is greatSettlers of Catan - very good.  The regular version is only okay for two (I think it is 3 or 4 players, normally) - but there are two versions of card games that are good.  The dice game is also awesome, and travels well.The Rivals for Catan (2 player card game - good)Catan dice game - huge fun, easy to play, and who doesn't like weird score sheets, and dice with sheep on them?Tikal - cool exploration game, there is a new version (Tikal II) that supposedly plays faster.TransAmerica - fun, fast.  Play several times in an evening.  There is also a Europe (TransEuropa) version.Lost Cities - best game for couples, ever.Saint Petersburg - Good.  Not as much as some others, but some interesting strategies.Hansa - great game, and fun.  The Author (Michael Schacht) has a great website, with some variants (free to print) available.Web of Power- from same author as Hansa - I like the medieval version, it is out of print (but free on his website) - but available as \"China\" - different theme, different board.Attika - excellent game.  Can be a little competitive, but still fun.Caylus - interesting medieval theme.  Collect resources, and place workers, to builds a village around a castle.Pillars of the Earth - worker placement game (similar to Caylus, above, and Stone Age, below).  Lots of references to the Ken Follett novel.Stone Age - fun worker placement game.  All three of these (Caylus, Pillars, and Stone Age) play different enough to each be fun.El Grande - very strategic.  Gives some people a headache to play, but I like it.  Not bad with 2 (rules variation) best with 4 or 5.Terra Nova - fun.  Also fun with three players.  A little more strategic than some others.Pandemic - cooperative game.  Hard to win.  I love it.  Anita hates it.  Enough said. Through the Desert - build networks of plastic colored camels.  Much more fun than it sounds, and the camels look like pastel candies.  Good for 2,3,4 or 5 players.Ticket to Ride - best intro game to Euro strategy games (all of those listed here).  Lots of variants.  Either USA or Europe are the best place to start.  Nordic Countries is good for 2 players, but so are the others, and Nordic Countries has some weird strategies.Small World - fun fantasy \"wargame\" - super light weight, but lots of interesting combinations.There are others.  For instance, I really LOVE Power Grid - but it is a super analytical game (then again, so is El Grande).  But I didn't include it because it can be a bit unforgiving.  That isn't so much fun in a couples game."},

Here is the intro from the scenario:The Carthaginians learned from earlier defeats in Sicily that they had to field reliable, trained heavy infantry of their own. They formed the Sacred Band, a force of about 2,500 excellently trained Carthaginians, as good or better than the best the Greeks or Syracusans could field. They formed a part of a large army under Hasdrubal, advancing eastward to subjugate Sicily. Opposing him with a much smaller army was the able tactician Timoleon. Ever aggressive, Timoleon anxiously awaited an opportunity to strike the Carthaginians a hard blow on his terms. He got that chance when, on a foggy morning, Hasdrubal carelessly ordered his army to cross the Crimissos River without bothering to send out scouts (who would have reported that Timoleon’s army was arrayed on the bluffs just beyond the river). Waiting until about half of the Carthaginian army had crossed, Timoleon unleashed his excellent heavy infantry phalanx against the surprised Carthaginians. Most who survived fled, but the Sacred Band stood their ground and were annihilated by superior numbers, (aided by a sudden rainstorm that slowed Carthaginian reinforcements crossing the river). Seeing the disaster unfolding across the river, the remainder of Hasdrubal’s army broke and fled. The loss of so many citizen soldiers had a horrific effect on Carthage. The Sacred Band was reformed, but only once was it ever dispatched from Africa again, and then only for a very short campaign. Chris totally dominated my Carthaginians in this scenario, and he ended up winning 5-1 - a smashing defeat!  The Carthaginian Sacred Band was his first target (they were playing \"Houses of the Holy\" and he doesn't like Zeppelin).  His Syracusan Heavy Infantry totally outclassed my African Citizens.We went on to play a second game, after some tasty treats from the Flying Dog brewery (I had the Doggy Style Classic Pale Ale, which is pretty low carb for my diet, and also the Snake Dog India Pale Ale - also low carb).The second outing for us was the battle of Bagradas (253 BC).  I got to play General Regulus and his Roman army, fighting in North Africa in this battle from the end of the First Punic War.  Chris played the army of Xanthippus, a mercenary Greek general for the Carthaginians.  Here is the text on the scenario from GMT:The Romans are on the verge of defeating Carthage and ending the First Punic War. Regulus and a veteran Roman army have landed in Africa, and though woefully short of cavalry, have defeated several Carthaginian forces. Desperate, the Carthaginians turned to an otherwise unemployed Greek general, Xanthippus. While not on a par with Alexander the Great, Xanthippus at least knew how to train and command an army, and that was enough. The Carthaginian army marched into the Bagradas Valley, and Regulus, confident of yet another victory, offered battle. It was to prove a costly mistake for him. The Carthaginian cavalry and elephants routed the Roman cavalry, and then turned on the flanks and rear of the Roman army, now fully engaged with the Carthaginian infantry. The Roman army disintegrated. Those who survived told of the horror of being overrun by elephants and cavalry. This Carthaginian victory prolonged the war. It took several years before any Roman army would stand and fight against elephants. The larger lesson— proper employment of a combined arms army over a largely infantry army resulting in victory—was lost on the Romans. They had to re-learn it at the Trebbia, Lake Trasimenus and Cannae. This one was much closer in the end.  At the beginning, however, Chris was totally dominating my Roman army.  The score after the first few exchanges was something like 5-1 in favor of the African force under Xanthippus, but then my Romans rallied, and it became 6-6.  Finally, I got lucky, and it ended up at 7-7.The Carthaginian Elephants were quite fun to play in this scenario, and when they rampaged (which they did several times) they were a danger to both sides.I could have lost 6 battles in a row, and I still would have loved my time playing. A great evening.Pet Peeve: people who walk up and see the game and say \"oh, what a silly game, it looks like Stratego\".  Don't these people know this game came from Miniatures play, and was only later converted to a board game?  Whatever.Tags: wargames"},

{"title": "Those Whacky Supplements", "date": "Sunday, February 13, 2011", "text": "No, gentle readers, the Staff at \"Gaming with Chuck\" did not begin selling vitamins or other Dietary Additives.  What I am talking about in this article are Add-Ons to games - expansions, kits, supplements - whatever you like.  In particular, I am going to give a quick review of three that really stretch the theme of the original game that they were added on to.  But, at least for some, that doesn't mean they are a bad add-on!First up - the new (and very welcome) supplement of Alvin and Dexter for Ticket to Ride.  What do you get?  Well, in the small box, you get two great figurines (for Alvin the Alien, and Dexter the Dinosaur), and a small deck of 42 cards.  You also get a small rules brochure, with the rules printed in a handful of languages.  What does it do? After the initial set-up of a Ticket to Ride game (any board, apparently, works for this supplement), the last player then places one of the new Monster figurines on a city on the board.  Then the next-to-last player places the other Monster figurine on another city.  There are two decks of 20 Monster cards (one for each figurine), and two Monster Bonus cards for the end of the game - these all get placed near the board.  Then play commences as usual.  During the game, you may (in addition to your normal turn) play a locomotive card to move a monster figurine up to 3 cities, following network lines.  You may play two cards to move the figurine up to 6 cities.  You may only move the same monster twice with two cards, not each monster once.  When you do this extra action (either one or two cards) you select one of the Monster Cards of the type you moved (either Alvin or Dexter) and place it in front of you until your next turn.  While there is a monster card in front of someone, that monster may not be activated by someone else.  Once your turn comes around again, you turn the card face down, but you keep it.  While a monster is in a city, nobody can claim (build) routes into or out of that city.  At end of the game, the player with the most Monster Cards of each critter gets the monster bonus for that critter.  Tickets, at the end of the game, with a Monster on one of their cities, are only worth half.  Uncompleted tickets with a monster on one of their cities, only cost half(!) as much.Opinion Yes, Great!Second up - the recent (2010) Agricola Legen*Dairy Forest Deck, which is a follow-up to the X-Deck.What do you get?You get a small box with 24 cards in it, and a small rules folder.What does it do? More cards for Agricola.  This includes the Event deck, first from the X-Deck supplement.  The cards here are all from a light hearted fantasy/fairy-tale motif.  Quite a few have some Monty Python and the Holy Grail DNA injected into them (which is a good thing.Opinion Yes, Great!Third Up - the 2008 Carcassonne: The Catapult add-on for Carcassonne.What do you get?You get a wooden catapult for launching(!) round cardboard tokens.  You get a bunch of cardboard tokens that are to be launched with the catapult, and you get a handful of new tiles all with the \"Faire\" symbol on them.What does it do?Whenever you pull and play a tile with a Faire symbol on it, that starts a Catapult round.  The player who just played the Faire symbol gets to shoot a token from the edge of the board towards the middle of the layout of tiles.  Depending on the token chosen (each player starts with one of each type), several actions are possible: Knock out tokens try to remove meeples; Seduction tokens try to swap meeples; Target tokens try to hit the faire tile; Catch tokens must be caught for points.Opinion Nope, give it a miss!Okay, so why did the \"Gaming with Chuck\" staff like the first two add-ons and not the third one?  I think the reason is simple - framework.  The first two listed are within the framework of the game they add on to - in the case of Alvin and Dexter, you are still just drawing and playing cards.  Now you get to move an alien piece, but its effects mesh into the structure very well.  In the second case there are just more cards to choose from - whether they are events (introduced in X-Deck), or new occupations or minor improvements.  Each, in some way, adds to the Agricola experience by introducing new rules and/or actions - but each is essentially a basic Agricola component.  In the third case, you are taking the basic structure of the game (decision-based tile placement and scoring) and adding in a wonky dexterity based shoot-it-up mechanic that is very different from the framework of the game.  The faire tiles work within the framework, but the actual catapulting does not (again, according to the opinions of management, workers, and elves at Gaming with Chuck).Tags: boardgames"},
{"title": "Steam - An excellent session at Williamsburg Muster", "date": "Thursday, February 10, 2011", "text": "Williamsburg Muster (our next convention will be Guns of August, Aug 12-14) was last weekend, in Williamsburg, Virginia.  It was an excellent time!  We had over 200 gamers come to the convention, in addition to the 70 staff and vendor bodies that were there (but hey - we all get to play at the Muster)!One of the things I got to do (more later some of the other stuff I was part of) was play a great game of Steam on Friday night with some old friends and some new friends.  Steam is a relatively new re-implementation of Age of Steam, from the genius of Martin Wallace.  Great game, with turns (in the basic game) consisting of (1) choosing roles (which grant special privileges through the turn; (2) building tracks and city improvements; (3) moving cargoes; and (4) adjusting income.  In the advance game, rather than choose roles, they are auctioned off.  It adds a good deal more strategy, but with the addition of an auction and also a money sink.Around the table were Jeremy C (Black), Bob W (Natural), Byron C (White), Jake DT (Green) and myself (Orange).  We played (since I only had the base set, and we had 5 players) the Germany map.{Not actually our game}The game was great.  The thing I love about Steam (other than role selection, building, and TRAINS!!!) is that there are several paths to victory.  We played the basic version, which allows for money borrowing at any time, and also allows for role selection in order (vs. bidding for it each turn, which makes the game economy harder by creating a resource sink, but I digress into game theory).{Actually our game}Anyway, at the end of the game, the four of us other than Jake were pretty closely grouped together.  Jake, on the other hand, had over 10 points more than any of us.  Fun, but disgruntling.  I definitely want to play more!When I got Steam, I was definitely interested in a tile based train game.  The other options open to me would be to find a used copy of Railroad Tycoon, a copy of Age of Steam, Railways of the World or some other tile based railroad game (less popular than those).  Age of Steam has a zillion supplements available for it, many of which seem to be compatible with Steam.  But between those two Steam wins, because it is (1) more casual gamer friendly, and (2) has more attractive components.  Railroad Tycoon is based on one of my favorite computer game franchises, is ALSO a Martin Wallace design (albeit with development by Glenn Drover of Eagle Games), and has AWESOME plastic bits for the towns.  However . . . the board is HUGE (3 feet by almost 4 feet), and won't fit on most tables.  It has been replaced by Railways of the World - which was the serious contender against Steam.  In the end, I think I chose Steam because of all the Age of Steam variants that could be accessed.  However, there are already several nice new boards, etc out for Railways of the world. From talking with some TAGS guys (Jake, who played, and David) it appears as if there are enough differences to possibly warrant also getting Railways of the World, one day when I'm rich and famous.The Good Fellows playing at Williamsburg Muster"},

Here is a list, I hope I didn't forget anything.Battles of Westeros - Gotten from Secret Santa on BGG - Thanks, Secret SantaTalisman, 4th Edition - Great fun, and the whole Staff likes itCastle Ravenloft - Looks great, haven't played yet.Dominion, Big Box - Included the Alchemy and Prosperity expansions!Forbidden Island - We played this at Woodhole, and it was a blast!Shadow Hunters - Very nice gift from Bob & Carol, haven't played yet!Carcassonne, Wheel of Fortune - Looks cool, haven't played yet!Roll Through the Ages - Civilization in 30 minutes!  Great!Gardens of Alhambra - Once you get past that tile flipping thing, it is a whole lot of funWings of War, Famous Aces Wanted for a while, finally delivered by John Dent!Marco Polo Expedition - Knizia.  That's all I have to say on this one, so far.TransEuropa - Includes Vexation which we can use with this and TransAmericaCardcassonne - Played last year with Erin and Rob, and loved it.Are there any requests for reviews for any of these?  I think I will try to do something for most of them over the upcoming months.  Playing these gems and treasures is the least I can do to say Thank You to the gift givers.Tags: boardgames"},
{"title": "A Recap of the Holidays at GwC Headquarters", "date": "Monday, January 3, 2011", "text": "The holidays at Gaming with Chuck HQ were very pleasant, in spite of several mishaps.First the mishaps - on Christmas Eve, Anita proceeded to suffer from an accident that resulted in her having to be rushed off to the emergency center for 10 stitches in her left hand.  Luckily, she rolls dice with her right hand.  Then, of course, on Christmas Day and St. Stephen's Day we were dumped on by the largest blizzard in these parts since the mid 80s.  We got over a foot of snow.All of this meant, of course, that we had some great Gaming going on!In the days leading up to Christmas, I ventured forth to meet up with my ODMS Brethren for some real wargaming.  On the Monday before Christmas, I played some Cold War Commander with Scot (as detailed here).  I also met up on a Thursday in the middle of Advent with Wayne and some other great fellows for boardgaming.  There was lots of Commands&Colors:Ancients being played (as there should be.On Christmas Eve we celebrated by having some friends over (once we realized that Anita's hand wasn't too bad off) for dinner and drinks, and of course board games!  We played Citadels, Power Grid, and took a long hard look at Battles of Westeros (too many people, but it sure does look cool).On subsequent days, Anita and I played some Settlers of Catan (with some variants from Traders and Barbarians), Stone Age (great fun) and also some Agricola (still one of my favorites).Finally, on the Sixth day of Christmas, we traveled north to Fredericksburg, to spend New Year's Eve at our friends' (Carol and Bob) house.  Of course, that meant more gaming.  There was Bang, Cash & Guns, Ticket to Ride, Unspeakable Word, Thurn and Taxis and Apples to Apples.  All that, plus time to travel into DC in order to spend most of Friday (New Years Eve) at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History.  That put me in the mood to play Stone Age...Coming up is MarsCon in January, Williamsburg Muster and PrezCon in February, and that will be about it for me for gaming until after my PhD is finished.  In the meantime, while getting ready for MarsCon, I have been fleshing out my fantasy roleplaying world when I have some spare time from school work.  The fruits are over at Valley of the Old Ones.I hope you have a great and blessed New Year, and that your holidays were wonderful as well!Tags: boardgames, boardgaming"},
{"title": "Cold War Commander - East Germany vs. West Germany, 1968", "date": "Tuesday, December 21, 2010", "text": "I got to play a game of Cold War Commander yesterday at the Hangar.  We used Microarmor to do a small 1968 clash between mixed forces from West Germany vs. East Germany.BTR-60  West Germans - a pair of Leopards, four M-47s and 6 squads of Infantry riding in HS-30s.  Backed up by a small battery (3 tubes) of 155mm US provided artillery.West German HS-30East Germans - T-55s led the way, supported by a pair of vintage JS-IIs, backed up by BRDM-1s (with Saggers) and BTR-60s carrying a mix of East German infantry, and some weapons teams (12.7mm HMGs).BRDM-1 with AT-3 SaggerWe fought over a forested area, with a lovely scenic pond in the middle of the battlefield.  The M-47s were caught in the open by the T-55s, but the higher training and initiative of the West German tankers proved too much for the godless communists.JS-II - Josef Stalin would be proud.The pair of JS-2s tried to get the jump on the HS-30s (and destroy them before they disgorged the infantry) but the West Germans were again too fast, and they deployed out of the APCs.  The East German infantry came up behind the Stalin tanks, and there was a lot of death on both sides.  In a moment of terror - the West German scouting element (a couple of long range patrol infantry scouts, with a dog and some binoculars) were brutally gunned down by DDR machine gunners.Leopard-1 - a later model, but still a lovely tank.In the end it looked like the decadent West won the battle.  More should follow as Scott and I vowed to play more of this great ruleset, and more frequently.M-47 - in Curious \"Battle of the Bulge\" movie livery.Tags: Cold War"},

{"title": "Valley of the Old Ones - Week of Encounters Completed", "date": "Monday, December 6, 2010", "text": "The one thing I have been working on, gaming wise, has been the launch of a new blog dedicated to my (occasional and sporadic) roleplaying activities.  It is based on a new fantasy campaign world that I have been thinking about for a while.  Both the world setting, and the blog are called the Valley of the Old Ones.The whole thing, rather old school (intentionally) in feel, is based on some disturbing and exciting deep dark secrets, but those are not for print (at least not in the light of day), but rather for the players to discover in the dark dark places of the realm.  In preparation of this world for unveiling at MarsCon '11, I have done up a starter adventure and a bunch of pre-generated characters, and began the \"Week of Encounters\" challenge to get me to write up seven different encounters that will entice others who are thinking about my gaming world.  Those encounters are:The King's HighwayThe Fell Beast of Riven MoorCaptain Lu d'Ross and Caerilla Ne QuoldaTerror of the StoatmenLiving Skulls of the Purple MarshHorrors of the Red SwordsmenThe Staff of St. VarinaI have not been writing concerning board games and miniature games lately, however I am excited to be able to try out a few new ones coming up at Williamsburg Muster.In the meantime, please enjoy this notice of big changes in the Dr. Who universe.Tags: Doctor Who"},
{"title": "Week of Encounters - progressing over at \"Valley of the Old Ones\"", "date": "Monday, November 29, 2010", "text": "My week of encounters is progressing nicely over at Valley of the Old Ones.  This is my answer to my own \"Seven Encounters Challenge\" that was posted a short while back, here at Gaming with Chuck.With lots of Holiday travel this past week, I got off schedule a little bit, but I have 5 of my promised 7 postings done already, and the next two are coming in the next day or so.These are all encounters (some simple combat encounters, some descriptions of more in-depth adventures to be developed by a GM as he/she sees fit) that reveal a little bit of something or other concerning my game setting- the Valley of the Old Ones.Valley of the Old Ones is intended to be an old school fantasy roleplaying setting. The idea is that there is a lot of weird stuff out there (to capture that feeling we had 30 years ago when first playing FRPGs and all the stuff - monsters, magic, settings - were new and needed to be discovered), and there is a sinister undertone to some elements of the world.  There was a race of \"high men\" - very magically advanced men - who dwelt in the valley a long time ago.  They were involved in the active worship of four of the Great Old Ones (known to us under other names - such as Cthulhu and Azathoth, etc).  That race eventually (and mysteriously) vanished, and the younger races took their place in the great valley (which is some 1600 miles long and 900 miles wide).  Their ancient places are somewhat still around to be explored and discovered, and a lot of the legacy of their weird magics and practices are around.  An interesting setting, I think."},

Why should people be interested in your setting, over all of the other ones out there?  Sure, you think it is cool to run adventures in \"The Land of the Pickle People\" or the \"Lost Bedrooms\" - but why should other GMs or players care?  In short - what are the hooks that make your world unique?I think that it should be possible to expose some of the Really Cool elements of a world within just a few short encounters.  Do you have an alien race, school of magic, fantastic setting, flavor of monster or something else that makes your setting unique and fun?  If so, write a couple of short encounters describing it.This is a challenge to all blog writers (old school, new school, etc) who have blogs about Roleplaying Game Settings.  And even those who are even vaguely interested in RPGs.  Also - it doesn't just have to be a world of your own creation - if you really like Glorantha (for instance) and have been itching to get your players to play Runequest, use this as an excuse to write up some really cool encounters to make them want to play there.Use this as an excuse to have a Week of Encounters, where you write one encounter (no matter how brief, or how detailed) each day for a week.  It gets some really cool content out there on blogs - gives the GMs who are writing about their worlds an excuse for cool content - will generate some great encounters that players will be exposed to - and is a good way to give people an excuse to see what your world is all about.The Valley of the Old Ones setting described over at the Blog of the same name will be taking up this challenge.  I may (if time permits) also do something similar for the Fourteen Suns blog.Those taking up the challenge, leave a comment with a link to your blog.Tags: roleplaying"},
{"title": "The Great Schism - RPG posts split from Gaming with Chuck", "date": "Thursday, November 18, 2010", "text": "In order to split content, I am now moving all posts related to FRPG to my new blog, Valley of the Old Ones.  Initially, this will have a lot to do with the setting of the same name, and also the fantasy games I plan to run at MarsCon.  In the future, who knows?  It is still an in-house publication, run by the \"Gaming with Chuck\" staff, and will be linked to from here regularly.See you on the other side....Tags: roleplayingHere is the basic area map for the countryside surrounding Finch Abbey.  I am planning a more detailed version, but the details are not meant for the eyes of the scenario players, so it will remain safe and secure in my GM notebook.The key to the map is as follows:1.Finch Abbey – former abbey of St. Brigid – Hedgehog people monastery2.Trevor Landing – Out of use boat landing3.Kliban Tower – Tower of a dead wizard4.Village of Nosh – Western most village of Gorrem Castle5.Tozen Quarry – flooded stone quarry6.Raifhome Keep – Home to the retired mercenary, Raif the Spear.7.The Red House – Very old marble villa, now a nest to a clan of ogres.8.Haunt of the Spider – Tower of a dead wizard9.Ruins of Fernrush – Once a wealthy trading town, now ruins.Although the scenario of the game centers around the player-characters starting out at the Village of Nosh (in a tavern called \"The Happy Lute\" no less...) and then traveling to Finch Abbey, I wanted to populate the map with other interesting locations that could be of use later on for other gaming sessions.

{"title": "Forest Abbey of the Hedgehog People (part 1)", "date": "Wednesday, November 17, 2010", "text": "One of the keys to the old school adventure I am dreaming up for MarsCon is the peaceful fantasy race known as the Hedgehog People.  Their own name for themselves is the Roikkitikki, but everyone else just calls them the Hedgehog People, or just the Hedgehogs.For visual inspiration, I take my cues from the marvelous artwork done for the Ironclaw rpg, especially the hedgehogs.In my setting of \"The Valley of the Old Ones\" the hedgehogs usually inhabit relatively peaceful forests,near (but not too close) to the civilized lands of peaceful people.  When encountered outside of their forests, they are usually in small groups consisting of monks and clerics of St. Brigid.  They don't usually deal in magic, get along well with halflings and gnomes, admire humans of the better sort, but distrust the elves.  Hedgehogs are excessively fond of feasting, and usually tend towards the pacifistic.For my scenario, the group in question is a community associated with the Abbey of Finch, in the Redsmoke Woods.  This small forest lies along the Fernrush River, which is a southern tributary to the Great River.  Nearest the Abbey, the Fernrush is about a mile wide, and is home to sporadic trade and fishing.East of the forest, the rolling hills in the demesne of Gorrem Castle.  The lands have been lawless for several years, and most of the villages and holdings have started looking to their own defense, without the castle to protect them.  During this period, a number of bands of goblins have worked their way north into the Redsmoke and have been raiding out, threatening outlying settlements that were once under the protection of Gorrem.  Finch Abbey has recently fallen to one of those bands, but there must be something more sinister at play, because of the degree of evil coming out of the former peaceful sanctuary.  A band of raiding goblins couldn't possibly be responsible for the atrocities committed.Maps and write-ups coming soon, subject to real life demands, of course!"},

{"title": "Veteran's Day, Remembrance Day, WWI and Wargaming", "date": "Sunday, November 14, 2010", "text": "Yes, the fact that Veteran's Day (known under other names, such as Remembrance Day) is on November 11 is for a very real reason.  The Armistice that ended WWI was signed in a Railway Car on November 11, in 1918.  It was signed by the Allied commander in chief, Foch, and also by the German representative Erzberger.  Although the signing took place at 5am, the effective time of the ceasefire between Western Front belligerents took place at 11am.  So 11th hour, 11th day, 11th month of 1918.  Okay, enough history (I had to write this because I recently saw an article on Remembrance Day comparing it Memorial Day in the US, and mentioned that by coincidence it was also Veteran's Day, but never mentioning why the date is important - one wonders if the author of that article knew what was important about 11/11).Now, on to WWI wargaming.  This article focuses on Board Games, but I may do a similar treatment for Miniatures Rules.  There have been a lot. From some Avalon Hill standards like Guns of August and 1914 to more modern fare like Clash of Giants and Paths of Glory.  The magazine Command had two that were very appealing to me - 1914: Glory's End and 1918: Storm in the West.There have been some wonderful boardgames on the Naval aspect of the war, again going back to the venerable Jutland from Avalon Hill, Dreadnought from SPI and the more recent Avalanche Press tour de force series, The Great War at Sea.  Once again, Command Magazine also had a great treatment - Jutland, the Duel of Dreadnoughts.  In fact if we limit our examination to just games with the name Jutland in the title (which is not surprising, since it was far and away the single more important naval engagement of the conflict), we uncover the two player card game Jutland from the prolific Lloyd Krassner of Warpspawn Games.Moving on to the dan of warfare between aircraft, we see a number of titles - from the excellent Avalon Hill title Richthofen's War through GDW's Blue Max, the very clever Ace of Aces published by Nova Games, and in modern times the immensely successful Wings of War.Finally, there are some very interesting grand scale games that attempt to show the entire war, at a highly aggregated level of detail, but one which gives a great overview. Amongst these, of course, is the revolutionary game Diplomacy, which is about the origins of the war.  But also in this category is the new First World War published by Mayfair and Phalanx.Lots to pick from, and to make things even MORE interesting, within ODMS we have a new design for the battle of Tannenberg (the 1914 version) based on the excellent Napoleonic 20 series of games from Victory Point games.  At our Nov 11 meeting of the club, John Dent and I got to play the game a couple of times, and it is really enjoyable.  Look here for some interesting additions to the game, and some cool reuse of the same idea for other battles.Tags: world war one, wargames, board games"},
{"title": "Valley of the Old Ones", "date": "Saturday, November 13, 2010", "text": "A setting for some Old School roleplaying. Drawn using Autorealm.Once, ages ago, before even the dragons remember, the Old Ones held court on the sunny face of the world.  At that time, Ba'a Zarn, the king of the Old Ones, ruled a mighty empire.  His craftsmen were the source of many things - the stars, music, time - but one of the the strongest things they built was the King's Highway.This highway is a massive stone lane, large enough for the King's chariots to ride over, built on top of a mound that varies between 100 and 200 feet above the surrounding plains.  Periodically, there are ancient guard towers that still stand, and massive stone lined tunnels that go through the mound.  There are even tunnels under the mound for the tributaries of the Great River to run through.The Great River circles the entire world, and the King's Highway generally follows its course.The Valley of the Old Ones is one spot along the Great River, home to the ancient human city of Narn.  The valley measures 1600 miles from end to end. The city is old and crumbling, but was once mighty enough to withstand attacks from the warlords out of the mountains surrounding the valley.  Now it is mostly bereft of riches, so is not the subject of attack nearly so much.In the plains throughout the valley, countless small unknown villages dot the countryside.  With the collapse of Narn some generations back, local nobles began the construction of many of their own castles and keeps, to keep safe from the mountain raiders.Today, Humans, Elves, Dwarves and Halflings dwell in the valley, trying to make a peaceful life.  The surrounding ancient ruins and wonderous sites remind them that the Old Ones once roamed here.  Those same sites can be the home of adventure and exploration, but can also be the source of great, unnatural danger.This will be the setting of a number of old school adventures that I am brewing up.  I hope to reveal the first at MarsCon (January 2011).Tags: fantasy role playing"},
{"title": "Retro-Clone RPG based on the RC of BD&D", "date": "Monday, November 8, 2010", "text": "Okay, I think that is the most Acronym laden title of any article here at Gaming with Chuck.  (The Staff is currently on a Health Improvement Program (HIP) and that means increased levels of vitamins being consumed.  So there is a big fascination with letters....)Okay, a Retro Clone of a Role Playing Game is one of a new-ish batch of RPGs that seek to capture either the specific rules or the flavor of classic RPGs.  You know - like Good Old Dungeons & Dragons (or Basic D&D).  One of the versions of that game (a pretty good one) was the old Rules Compendium.  A great collection of rules.  It has everything in it that I usually like in a simple RPG - good distinct classes.  Nice list of spells and equipment.  Skill system.  Weapon system.  In fact, for me, the only things missing would be (1) Speed factors on spells and weapons (easy to add in), and (2) Tactical moves for doing combat with miniatures (also easy to add in).Alright - so there is this great new retro-clone of the RC version of BD&D called \"Dark Dungeons\" (yes, named after the made-up game in the old Chick comic.  If you have to ask, then you are better off not knowing).It has it all.  And in true to form honesty to old Basic D&D (or OD&D - Original D&D, although that is sometimes more narrowly defined as old White Box D&D - again, if you have to ask, you are better off not knowing, although it might be a good plan for the Staff to write a history of versions of D&D) there are only Classes, not the Race/Class combination we have seen in so many other RPGs.  This means that if you want to play an Elf - then that is your class.  This bodes well for the geek tshirt I once saw that said \"I Remember when Hobbit was a Class\" - and it was in OD&D.  It is again in Dark Dungeons (although, for several legal reasons, they are called Halflings).How does this race-as-class thing work out?  Well it makes the race of non-humans Really important.  As in it is a big deal if you say you are an Elf.  Unlike in, say, AD&D when you are an Elf MU or an Elf Fighter, or an Elf F-M-C, then there is not too much of a big deal about the Elf Part.  Especially in 2E, 3E or 4E (remember the vitamins thing and acronyms).  But in OD&D - and in Dark Dungeons - being an Elf is a big deal.So what are these races as class all about?  More coming in a future article but briefly - Elf is a Fighter/Magic User mix.  Halfling is a Fighter/Thief mix.  And Dwarf is crusty.  Like I said - more coming soon.Also - look for some coming up articles on content for Dark Dungeons.  I am inspired . . .ps- thank you especially to Matt and Braz, whom I saw at Battlefield Band in Williamsburg on Nov 5 - and they got me jazzed up on Dark Dungeons.  Previously my favorite retro-clones included Castles & Crusades (which I still love - and the Castle Keeper's Guide finally came out - w00t), and Mutant Futures.  Both of those generated a fair amount of press here at GWC.Tags:"},
{"title": "Blocks of War III: C&C:Ancients (part 1 - the dice of Commands and Colors)", "date": "Tuesday, October 26, 2010", "text": "Before starting, let me state two things.1. I know that the C&C series, even when it uses blocks (like Ancients, and the upcoming Napoleonics) isn't a traditional Block game (like the gems from Columbia and other companies).  But in some fora it is considered to be part of the block games universe, just because of the physical implementation of the pieces (being, well, \"wooden blocks\").2. Even if you accept C&C:Ancients as a Block Game, then this article may prove to be a bit off because it is not an overview, replay, or review of the game.  Rather it is analysis of one piece of the game.Okay, what is this article about? In brief I will try to compare the various odds of causing a casualty within the different implementations of the C&C system that we have access to, today (that is, October 2010).Okay, first lets identify our quarry.  The C&C system has, as constituent games (each implementing the system somewhat differently):Battle Cry! (from Avalon Hill)Memoir '44 (from Days of Wonder)BattleLore (from Fantasy Flight Games)C&C: Ancients (from GMT)C&C: Napoleonics (due out from GMT)In each case, there is a dice spread that is rolled (on situationally varied numbers of dice).  The symbols of the dice then give you the results of that combat round (dead or retreating units, usually).But each one does it different.The oldest game in the series is Battle Cry!  It has dice with the following faces:InfantryInfantryCavalryArtilleryFlagWildcardThe three types of units in the game are: Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery.  The other pieces involved are Generals.Infantry (killed on Infantry and Wildcard symbols) - 3/6 or 1/2 per diceCavalry (killed on Cavalry and Wildcard symbols) - 2/6 or 1/3 per diceArtillery (killed on Artillery and Wildcard symbols) - 2/6 or 1/3 per diceGenerals (killed only on the Wildcard symbol) - 1/6 per dice(by the way, here is a picture of the New 150th Anniversary edition of Battle Cry coming next year)The next game in the series to come out is Memoir 44 - the excellent game of WWII combat.  It has dice with the following faces:InfantryInfantryArmorStarFlagGrenadeThe three types of pieces in the game are Infantry, Armor and Artillery.  There are lots of modifiers to the basic types, but that type determines which dice faces cause kills.Infantry (killed on Infantry and Grenade) - 3/6 or 1/2 per diceArmor (killed on Armor and Grenade) - 2/6 or 1/3 per diceArtillery (killed only on Grenade) - 1/6 per diceThis brings us to BattleLore - the great game of Medieval and Fantasy combat in the series.  This is a great game, originally from Days of Wonder, but later on (currently) from Fantasy Flight games.  Terrific scenarios (although I really like the historical scenarios that popped up on the Days of Wonder support website, before they were taken away with the move to Fantasy Flight), and lots of cool published supplements.  The dice in this game have the following symbols:Red ShieldBlue ShieldGreen ShieldSword/ShieldFlagLoreIn this game all the many unit types are all given a quality color, called the Banner Color (Red, Blue or Green).  Each of those units is killed on their respective dice faces (red units are killed by a red shield).In addition, the Sword/Shield marker works like the Grenade marker from Memoir 44 (i.e. it kills all units), however there are specific times when it works and when it doesn't (based on the Weapon being used by the unit attacking).  It does pretty well for almost all the hand-to-hand weapons, and half as well for missile weapons (some it just doesn't work for, like the common or short bow, as well as the cavalry reflex bow and the slingshot).  Some target types get to ignore the sword/shield hits form some weapon types (i.e. - knights).The most popular, so far, in the series has been the GMT offering, Commands and Colors: Ancients.  This is the first time the series name has been used (except on some of the Memoir 44 game literature - but it is never referred to as \"Commands and Colors: WWII\").The dice here are similar to those in Battlelore.Red ShieldBlue ShieldGreen ShieldSword/ShieldFlagGeneralThe results are similar as well, with colored units taking hits from corresponding dice.  Rather than weapons affecting the extra dice side, it is determined by unit type (of which there are a lot - light infantry, auxillia, medium infantry, barbarian infantry, heavy infantry and so on.  For instance, light infantry never hit on the Sword symbol.  Some units are immune to some hits (i.e. - heavy infantry and heavy cavalry).Okay, the last game of the set - Battles of Westeros.  Fantasy Flight Games put out this lovely boardgame about the battles of the George R. R. Martin fantasy novels, the Game of Thrones.  It is based on the Richard Borg system, however there are some modifications.  Chief amongst those are two - first, the command cards are not based on different sectors of the battlefield (unlike all of the other games in the series , so far).  Second, the dice are eight sided.  This is because of this dice spread:Red ShieldBlue ShieldBlue ShieldGreen ShieldGreen ShieldGreen ShieldValorFlagOkay, so with this spread we have interesting results - first Green units are killed 3/8 of the time.  Blue units 1/4 of the time and Red units 1/8 of the time.  That makes Red units very strong, in my opinion, but I have yet to play the game (I am only judging this by what is in the rulebook, and from my understanding of the dice odds).  Also, unlike some of the other games, there is no wildcard symbol in this version.  Interesting.Okay, so where does all this take us.  First - I think the most tactical of the games are BattleLore and Ancients.  I suspect that the upcoming Napoleonics release (which I have pre-ordered and which is due next month) should also be quite high-granularity in its tactical details.  But most importantly, in the games where there is little in qualitative difference among the troop types (i.e. - Memoir 44 and Battle Cry) there is a big difference in the odds of basic types (like infantry) vs. the stronger types (cavalry, armor, etc) being killed.  Fair enough - without the differences of different grades (or weapons, etc) you have to introduce some tactical difference.... Now, I have to see Westeros to see where the interesting bit is there, I suspect it may be amongst the different leaders and their abilities, but it is not in my clutches yet!Okay, so that is what I have to say on dice.  Curious that in some the difference in odds is driven mainly by attacker difference, and in some others the difference in odds is driven mainly by defender differences.  In all cases, the dice pool size being rolled is a function of attacker type.  Regardless they all play somewhat different because of these variations, and that is what makes the whole series appealing, rather than just one or two of the titles.Tags: boardgames"},
{"title": "October 25 - a day of famous battles", "date": "Monday, October 25, 2010", "text": "There are at least three great battles that the staff of Gaming with Chuck is particularly fond of, that all took place on October 25.  Other than being something like the 289th day of the year, it is also St. Crispin's Day (Crispin Crispianus) as any fan of Shakespeare will no doubt remember (read on)...The first, of course, is the Battle of Agincourt in 1415.  This battle marked the defeat of the Prince of France by young King Henry V of England in the 100 years war.  Great stuff, and the product of many boardgames and miniatures rules.  It is celebrated in Military History as one of the marker battles in the Revolution in Military Affairs the culminated in the ascendancy of Infantry over Cavalry as the chief battlefield arm.  And there were a whole lot of longbows.  And of course there is the fantastic treatment (mostly fictional, but still great fun) given to the battle by Shakespeare in his timeless \"Henry V\".  The famous Band of Brothers speech comes from that play.Great treatment of the battle from a bunch of different angles is given at WikipediaWe few, we happy few, we band of brothers; For he to-day that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile, This day shall gentle his condition: And gentlemen in England now a-bed Shall think themselves accursed they were not here, And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.The second is the Battle of Balaclava in 1854, in the Crimean War.  This is a battle fought between the British and French on one side, and the Russians on the other, over the rights of Turks amongst a bunch of other hegemonical things.  Other than the fact that it was a very interesting battle it is also the occasion for the famous Charge of the Light Brigade, which inspired the stirring poem of Alfred Tennyson.Excellent article on the battle (with maps, bios of the commanders, and a blow-by-blow including the stirring events of the North Valley that led to the Charge of the Light Brigade) is located at Wikipedia.  Some excellent maps are located at the battle's webpage at History of War.Half a league, half a league, Half a league onward, All in the valley of Death Rode the six hundred. \"Forward the Light Brigade! Charge for the guns!\" he said. Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred. Finally, in our own history, from October 23-26 the largest naval battle in history was fought - the Battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944.  The Imperial Japanese Navy lost a fleet carrier, three light carriers, three battleships, eight cruisers and countless lighter vessels and planes.  The United States lost one light carrier (and some lighter escorts).  It was a victory for the US and secured not only the Philippines from the Japanese, but also halted the IJN from being a serious threat - in fact the only remaining surface action of any size that the Japanese dared after Leyte Gulf was the suicide run of the Yamato at the very end of the war.Good article, with fantastic maps (for wargaming and just general historical drooling) again at WikipediaHope to see you wargaming, soon!ChuckTags: Military History, Wargaming"},
{"title": "Renaissance Wargaming", "date": "Thursday, September 30, 2010", "text": "Wow - this was (and I guess still is) one of my favorite periods in history.  Historians (as with most things) quibble over when the Renaissance should be placed (I think it goes well with the dried flowers on the mantle, but I never could decorate properly).  And of course there is some concern over the Northern vs. the Southern renaissance.  However, in painfully broad terms, this refers to the time of transition from the Medieval World to the Age of Enlightenment.  Warfare is characterized by a re-ascendancy of infantry over other arms; a rapid improvement in the worth and effectiveness of firearms; and causes for fighting that coalesce around modern ideas such as nuance in religious identity and nationalism.  In other words, Tercios, Pike & Shot, Roundheads, Sakers and Demi-Sakers, and all that other fun jazz.There is a website making available a great series of articles from Airfix magazine that were all written by the most excellent wargamer, George Gush.  For those who don't know about George Gush, he is the author of several old-school sets of rules that continue to be played quite popularly.  One of those was the WRG set on Renaissance Warfare.  From the WRG Historical Archives \"In June 1976, a set of War Games Rules for the period 1490-1660 written by George Gush  was published and this was followed in April 1978 by a slim book of 41 Army Lists. In  1979, the second edition was published and followed in March 1984 by a much thicker book  of Army Lists which now included 90 armies. Since George now owns the copyright, no pdf  version is included here.\" George Gush's most excellent rules for 1490-1660Okay, back to the articles.  These were published in the 1970s by Airfix Magazine, and other than a short introduction to the period (Part 1), there are sections on Infantry weapons and Tactics, Artillery, and Cavalry.  Then a whole series of different national army articles.  Very nice.  here is a list of the articles.Part 1: IntroductionPart 2: Infantry weapons and organisationPart 3: infantry missile weaponsPart 4: The artilleryPart 5: Cavalry weapons and organisationPart 6: Henry VIII's armyPart 7: Irish army of the 16th CenturyPart 8: The Universal SoldierPart 9: SwissParts 10 & 11: The TurksPart 12: The ScotsPart 13: the Polish ArmyParts 14 & 15: SpanishPart 16: The FrenchPart 17: the ImperialistsPart 18: Persians and other easternersPart 19: the Dutch armyParts 20 & 21: the Swedish armyParts 22 & 23: the MuscovitesThe website follows up with some links to other articles that Gush wrote, concerning Renaissance military concerns (from a website called My Armoury that features absolutely fabulous articles on military history as well as sword crafting). This is mother's milk for a wargamer, and interesting for those of us with an interest in Military History in general.Now if only Richard Borg would do Commands & Colors: Pike & Shot!(please don't take this too seriously, it is meant as a joke - and wishful thinking)Tags: renaissance, pike and shot, miniatures, wargaming, boardgames, military history"},
{"title": "Blocks of War II: Wizard Kings", "date": "Saturday, September 18, 2010", "text": "The second block game to get the \"Gaming With Chuck\" treatment, is Columbia Games' excellent fantasy wargame, Wizard Kings.Classic Orcs/Elves matchup, right out of the boxThis is a terrific design, from 2000, following on the 1998 release of Victory: The Blocks of War.  In both cases, the game itself is sort of a \"game kit\" in that it gives you some maps (which are geomorphic), a pair of generic armies, and some rules.  The games themselves are actually scenarios that use some subset of the bits that come in the box.  The scenario can be as simple as \"Each side chooses 100G of pieces, and come on the map from opposite sides.  The last man standing wins\".  Not very exciting, but certainly a scenario.  Now with the same pieces, a totally separate scenario can be played next time - very cool indeed (although this is true of almost all scenario based games).The base game comes with four maps (in the first edition, maps numbered 1 through 4 - there are 8 more maps available from Columbia Games as add-ons, and there are four more numbered 13-16 in the second edition box set).  An impressive variety of terrain types are represented on the maps, and all sorts of terrain configurations become available.At the beginning of the match, players select their armies based on a Gold Piece (point) value.  As with Hellenes, this is a classic Columbia style design, where the blocks take hits over time.  When \"purchasing\" a unit for a scenario, therefore, each successive level of the unit must be bought (up to the block's maximum, usually three or four).  The blocks are then placed on the board, in the cities on your side of the map if playing the basic scenario, and the game starts.There are seven different armies available for play.  This has changed between editions, but with the first edition of the game (which I own) the armies were Elves and Orcs (both came with the box set); Dwarves; Amazons; Norsemen; Undead; and Beastmen known as the Ferkin (more like Pigmen than Beastmen).  Each army has a unique set of unit types, but all involve a wizard, as well as an assortment of other unit types.  In the second edition, the Ferkin are replaced with a generic Human Medieval army.  The other big differences between the two editions are in how additional armies are acquired.  In the first edition, the game came with complete Orc and Elf armies.  You could purchase the other five armies, each separately, for a couple of bucks each.  With the second edition, you get a handful of blocks in the main set for each army, and you purchase reinforcement packs which come with random new blocks and stickers, enough for some in each army.  With the second edition, you automatically get some blocks for each army whether you like it or not (who wouldn't?).  There were also Chaos Mercenary sets (which included a bunch of monster, and enough blocks to assign four to each of the seven main armies), and the Were-Creatures set, which added optional rules to use phases of the moon to enhance/limit Were Creatures, and another set of four blocks and stickers for each of the seven Races/Armies.  The third big difference between the sets are the maps - the first edition comes with maps 1-4.  The second edition comes with maps 13-16.Multi-player game in progressThe game plays very well, and the pacing and advancement of the game are fun, if sometimes a bit slow.  When playing the standard scenario, which is simple conquest of the cities belonging to your opponent, the game can devolve into a big slugathon.  But when playing any of the multitude of scenarios available (or making some up) the game becomes much more interesting.Other than Magic, which is represented by a list of spells that your wizard can cast (each army is different, which gives good variety and more \"feel\" to the individual armies), the tactical combat rules are similar to other block games.  Each unit has an initiative rating, and a combat ability rating.  The initiative is a letter which gives general order for the blocks (lettered, 'A', 'B' and 'C').  Then the combat ability is a number, below which a dice rolled for that unit will score.  Unlike Hellenes, there is no card play (although on the excellent support fansite, Wizard Kings Wiki, there is a variant that used cards very similar to how they appear in Hammer of the Scots - a variant that continues to intrigue me), there is no route capability in combat.  Other than scenario specific, cities do not need to be besieged.The game is fun, interesting (if you like fantasy), ripe for scenario development, and suitable for multi-player play (which is great, if you want something more than a typical 2 player wargame).  Recommended, and a great block game.After some movement and combat, it is then time to reconstitute.  In most scenarios this means that you now have Gold Pieces (points) in order to either add to reduced levels of blocks out there, or to buy new blocks (and maybe enhance them up a few levels). I played a couple of rounds lately with my daughter, and she had a great time.  She then helped me set up my next game of WK, and picked Orcs vs. the Undead.  An uppity Necromancer wanted to take over the land of the Goblinoid hordes.  It was a good game - the cheap easily replaced Orc Army light infantry kept coming back after a slaughter, whereas many of the units in the Undead Army are quite expensive, so even when they did return from the dead, it took a couple of turns to build up their strength.

{"title": "Blocks of War I: Hellenes by GMT", "date": "Sunday, August 29, 2010", "text": "In a recent high level of activity, I played a number of different block games.  For the purpose of this series of articles, I am going to stretch the definition a bit and include the most excellent Richard Borg title \"C&C:A\", but this first entry, Hellenes from GMT is a classic block game in the most perfect tradition of blending the Columbia Games heritage with GMT's added goodness.Hellenes - Sparta in Red, Athens in BlueGoing back to Hammer of the Scots, and some titles from before, Columbia has been blending the great idea of their block games (which feature 1-sided wooden blocks for units, allowing for great fog-of-war; and the blocks rotate showing stepwise reduction in combat unit strengths) with the more modern ideas of card-activation in a wargame.  I don't know for sure (and I bet there are half a dozen forum articles and geeklists at Board Game Geek on the topic) but I think that the first of the card-driven designs may have been Hannibal and Successors both from Avalon Hill, but these were quickly improved and followed up by For the People, Paths of Glory and Wilderness War from GMT.  With the design for Hammer of the Scots, Columbia expanded the idea to separate the unit activation cards from event cards.  Each round a player picks one, and it gives either a number of activations (for units or groups of units), or an event.  This keeps the game always fresh and adds a lot to replay value.  The GMT idea for the cards had three things on each card - unit activations, events, or replenishment - and when a card was picked, the player then had to choose which they wanted.  The cards were balanced, so that the really good activation cards usually had the good events, and so on, so that the decisions were tough and required some decent thought and planning.  Elements that make for a great game, in my book.  By the way, see the homemade map for Hammer of the Scots, by DK Kemler (as posted on Board Game Geek)- it is beautiful!Homemade map for Hammer of the ScotsThe recent game Hellenes from 2009 takes the Columbia idea of blocks with hidden values, and rolling for combat based on a two-value combat rating.  The first value is a letter (in this case, from A to F) that gives the basic \"initiative\" value of the fighting - so that all A units fight before all B units and so on.  Then there is a numerical value (usually from 1 to 3) which gives the target number for scoring a hit.  Roll 1d6 for the strength (called the Combat Value, or CV) of the block (which ranges from 1 to 4, based on the current strength of the unit), and each dice that is equal or less to the \"hit\" number scores a hit on the enemy.  An equal range at the top of the dice span means an enemy unit is routed.  There are specifics about which units take the hits first, and who routs first, etc.  Simple, but elegant, and gives great results with some appreciable depth.  So far, this is classic Columbia Games (although I don't recall seeing the to-rout capability in older designs).  But GMT adds rules for naval transports (there are, not surprising in a game on the Peloponnesian War, lots of naval units), as well as rules for sieges, pillaging, and so on - to capture the feel of the city states going into rebellion, and being besieged (all from Thucydides - great stuff).  And with the activation cards all having an event, the goodness from GMT makes its way in.There is a 2007 Columbia design on the same topic - Athens & Sparta, which appears to be a little bit simpler, and can cover the entire war in one sitting (whereas the more detailed Hellenes covers scenarios of the war in a single sitting), but it is a small matter of difference about which card system you prefer.  Both have their strengths, and both (to me anyway) are appealing.On Thursday, August 26, Wayne and I played a game at the weekly ODMS meetup, and he took Athens while I became a Spartan general for the evening.  The game was great, and although I won, I believe it was due to a fluke in my exploiting the economic engine of the game a turn before Wayne was prepared for it.  We have scheduled a rematch, and shall see how it goes.  This time I think there will be a lot more fighting over the point-value-rich colony city states.  It, like the original war, should be glorious!On a side note, I would like to put out an endorsement for two histories on the Peloponnesian War - the first from Donald Kagan (The Peloponnesian War) (a few years older, but quite excellent), and the second from Victor Davis Hanson (A War Like No Other).Thanks,See you soon - ChuckTags: wargames, boardgames, Peloponnesian War"},
{"title": "Autumn Gaming is Approaching", "date": "Wednesday, August 25, 2010", "text": "After a very successful \"end of summer\" wargaming event - the ODMS convention, Guns of August, the staff from Gaming with Chuck is looking forward to some Autumn Wargaming.Autumn is coming at us hard and fast, like a Monkey riding a Goat, and if the schedule isn't filled up soon with some gaming activities, then all of the normal stuff that takes place this time of year will ensure that there ain't no gaming!

{"title": "Guns of August, After Action Review", "date": "Wednesday, August 18, 2010", "text": "ODMS Convention PageThe convention was a great success, from the perspective of the staff.  I can only hope the gamers felt the same way!  (comment about your experience, please!)On Thursday we got to the hotel (a day before the official start) to meet with the hotel staff and make sure everything was ship-shape.  The tables we rent were late getting there, so some of the ODMS guys helped to set them up right, so that everyone's games would go off with a minimum of disturbance over the weekend.After all the setup (and getting the hundreds of sodas and snacks loaded into our Hospitality Room), there was a round of boardgaming in the gaming area (the tables have to be broken in, you know).  The Vendors continued arriving all evening, from all over the eastern half of the US, and set up their fantastic wares.The Thursday night boardgaming was terrific.  I played a really neat game of Reef Encounter (polyps anyone?), and then proceeded to totally Borg out in repeated games of Commands & Colors: Ancients (for those who don't know, Richard Borg is the designer of C&C:A).The Reef Encounter game was with Anita, Heidi and Jeremy, and was a lot of fun.  Jeremy was king Shrimple, getting his prolific shrimp all over the ocean floor, and it turned out that his Parrot Fish ate the most coral.The C&C:A games were mostly against Wayne, but I also played against John Snelling as well.  the battle was the same for each game - the Battle of Leuctra.  Every time I played the Theben army, and every time I got the Sacred Band killed off by the Spartans.  The first game was the most humiliating, as Wayne's Spartans totally eviscerated me in about four turns.  I actually won a game or two, but still lost the Sacred Band each and every time.  I guess they weren't that Sacred after all.Friday came, and there were plenty and plenty of miniatures games, as well as a whole lot of board games.  I had to leave the convention in the afternoon for a few short hours, but in the evening when I returned, I got to run my \"Neil Thomas\" rules Napoleonics game.  It was an a-historical scenario - set in 1813 Saxony, with a British force facing off a French force twice its size, trying to buy time for the Prussian command in the area to arrive and help against the French.  The British were played by Paul Knight, the Prussians were played by Scott Kidd, and the French were played by two players new to the rules, whom I did not know, but whom were real gentlemen to play with.  The game went well, with Paul playing the role of a British commander very well (form a defended and anchored line of Infantry and hold it against repeated French assaults).  The Prussians finally arrived, and the French decided that they had enough.  My apologies to my players for not providing some really good player aids (the game needed quick-reference sheets).Saturday came, and during the day all I did was to help out with the convention (spending many hours in the morning working Registration and meeting many of the great gamers who came to play at our show).  In the afternoon, I got to spend a few short hours enjoying the hotel swimming pool (highly recommended) with my Daughter and some friends, and spending time talking to new gaming friends as well.  Very nice.Saturday afternoon, our Boardgaming room was a complete hit!  It was filled to overflowing with boardgamers playing old and new wargames, and the Euro-games library that we had in the Hospitality Suite was really put to good use, with a bunch of gamers checking things out (most popular - SmallWorld and Steam).  Tons of gaming in the Hospitality suite as well - Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, Settlers of Catan, and so on.On the Wargaming front, everything from the old SPI classic 1918 to the much newer Washington's War were being played.  There was also the double blind Axis and Allies game (each player only knew where his own pieces were, not even his allies).  Neato.Napoleon came and visited the convention on Saturday afternoon, and stayed until about 5:00 or so, when he gave an address to the gamers and bid his Adieu.  Afterward, the great Guns of August Raffle took place, and thirty great gaming prizes were raffled off.Saturday evening brought a new round of gaming for all involved, and I got to run my game of The Sword and the Flame.  It was a total fun-fest, with the Anglo-Indian army attempting to rescue a small command of Miners waiting for transport down a river, and suddenly attacked by hostile hill tribesmen.  This time, the British and the Indian troops were able to rescue the miners.  A few casualties, but it was a successful operation. Late night Saturday there was more gaming.  Card gaming, to be sure.  Plagues and Pestilence, which I (miraculously) won.  I almost never win those kinds of games, because there is almost always a \"pile on chuck\" phase, but this time I drank some excellent imported beer, and played it cool, while my fellow Medieval City Builders were busily destroying each other with mongols, vikings and bubonic bonbons.Sunday came, with more gaming and final shopping in the great Guns of August Hobby Bazaar, and afterward the vendors started breaking up and heading home, and the final games were played, and we all sang hey nonny nonny and bid each fare-thee-well until the Williamsburg Muster.It was a great time, and I hope you can make it to our next show!

The Italians were more hesitant than the Prussians, choosing mainly to hold onto the villages on their side of the river, while their divisions on the Italian left took up a defensive position to await the arrival of the British.On the Prussian side, there was a very aggressive advance, on the Prussian left leading with two advance battalions of Guard Infantry, and in the center with charging columns of troops assaulting across the central bridge, led by Fusiliers but followed up by Regular Infantry and Reservist Battalions.The British divisions arrived, and proceeded to take the upper hand (pretty quickly) against the Italians.  At one point, an Italian battalion trying to withdraw to a defensible position between a forest and the river's edge, was ridden down by a unit of Royal Scots Greys.Other action saw a battalion of French Grenadiers assaulting the village of Turnip, which was held at the time by some Prussian Reservist infantry.  After a nasty firefight, the Grenadiers proceeded to oust the Prussian infantry, and the French held the town.In the end it was a slight victory to the Italian/French side (13 VP to 10 VP), but might very well have changed if additional turns were played.

The benefits were - (1) two game tables, so neither was overcrowded, (2) different game tastes.  But I usually like playing with the girls, so next time we might split up different.The boys played two games - Stone Age and Hansa, and then talked a bit (quite a bit) about wargames - old (Avalon Hill and SPI) vs. new (Columbia Games and Richard Borg).  This involved taking a look at the old classic Napoleon, and the more recent \"classic\" Memoir 44.The girls on the other hand, played three games and spoke of other things.  They played Ticket to Ride, Unspeakable Words, and Apples to Apples.  The event also included catered sandwiches and chicken, as well as lots of fruit and cheese.

This is a fantastic volume, with information about all of the major players, and many of the minor players in the Napoleonic wars.  It rivals some of my other old stand-bys for Napoleonic uniform information (I really enjoy the Otto von Pivka volume, and my Knotel and Ball).Ordered, but not yet arrived, is a copy of the Digby Smith Uniforms of the Napoleonic Wars.  This one looks pretty good (I have flipped through copies at the library and bookstores).  The depth of unit-by-unit details don't appear to be there, but I may have missed something.  The color illos are nice, however.Finally, off the Napoleonic bandwagon, I have also been enjoying the recently arrived copy of Vanished Armies, and also a recent Hoyle-like volume on card games by David Parlett.Been trying to keep up with all of this...but my normal reading for school and research trumps the fun stuff.  For Christmas a few months ago I received the two DK volumes Battle and Warrior from Anita and Heidi.  They are the most phenomenal stuff, but I'll post on them later.Tags: military historyExcitement grows at \"Gaming with Chuck\" in anticipation of the Wargames Factory figures for War of the Spanish Succession being released.  Of course, that is not what the staff of GwC are planning on using them for.  Actually, a small war (The War of the Pumpkin-King Succession) between two Balkanian states is planned for these figures, although the uniforms of Poppenheim and Bombastia (curiously) mimic the uniforms of the Swedish and Russians during the Great Northern War.A great set of photos from a wargame of that OTHER conflict (GNW) is located at this Ilkley Lads associated website.  Very nice 28mm figures, some in game shots, and some in (apparently) posed shots.  All very nice.  I like the paint jobs on the figures, and the basing is interesting.A much later matchup between the Swedes and the Russians was in 1808-1809.  There is a terrific website that details much about that war (with a lot of good resources).  The pictures of the lovely Poppenheim and Bombastia female troopers in this posting come from that website (where they were Erroneously identified as Swedish and Russian troopers).It came to me this morning in a flash.  If I am planning on doing 24 figure battalions for the Balkanian conflict, then I can certainly do 36 figure battalions.  That would amount to something like 24 Musketeers (including officers, etc), on four stands.  Plus a stand of 6 Pikemen (actually the officers, etc, could be on this stand), and a stand of 6 Grenadiers (that could be peeled off for converging).  All on stands 60mm wide by 40mm deep.  Ooh.

{"title": "Standard Army Sizes", "date": "Thursday, May 20, 2010", "text": "I suspect that this is something that arose, over the years, first amongst figure resellers (who tried to come up with \"standard\" boxed armies based on published army lists), and then among rules writers to provide standard armies for systems that did not have points values (I am thinking of Tactica, etc).Recently, I started organizing my 15mm Napoleonics for Shako II.  99% of the games played in ODMS using Shako are scenario driven (some referee picks a scenario and sets the forces and terms of deployment and victory conditions, ignoring the standard army lists and tournament rules etc).  This is the way I usually like to play wargames.  However, I am using the army lists as a helpful rubric (like that?) for deciding how \"large\" my forces should be.  You know, so I don't try to build the whole invasion Leipzig campaign, man for man, in miniature.My observation is this - those are pretty large armies.  For instance, the Prussians (1813-1814 variety) have an army that looks like this:10x Battalions of Line Infantry10x Battalions of Landwehr Infantry5x Battalions of Jaegers/Fusiliers2x Battalions of Grenadiers/Guards1x Regiment of Cuirrasier2x Regiments of Dragoons1x Regiment of Landwehr Cavalry or Lancers1x Large Gun Battery1x Medium Gun Battery2x demi-Battalions of SkirmishersThat is with 12 figure battalions, and 6 figure regiments.  The size of units is flexible, and a battalion could be (reasonably) as few as 6 or as many as 24.  Most that I know of are doing between 12 and 16.Anyway - does that seem kind of large?  Almost all of the standard armies in that ruleset are approx 30 units (more or less - the Prussians are more, the British are less, etc), plus artillery and skirmishers.I know that rulesets like DBA do it smaller, and that Tactica armies could range quite large.  But this seems big for a \"standard\" army.Please comment below ?"},

{"title": "Principality of Bombastia", "date": "Friday, May 14, 2010", "text": "In the tradition of a long line of articles about Balkania, Gaming with Chuck now presents information about the early 18th century army of the Principality of Bombastia.Bombastia is a petty state, found within the Simian province of Furstenberg.  It is populated mainly by Ethnic Urbs, who are almost all uniformly gourd farmers.  While the economy of the region was never a glowing powerhouse, during the early and middle part of the 17th century, the Urbs of Bombastia fared pretty well.  Then the pumpkins stopped coming quite as early, nor blooming quite as big.  By the end of the century, almost half of all the Urb farms in the region were doing very bad.  Because of this, manpower willing to serve in the army of Prince Peter of Bombastia grew and grew.  Finally when the Crisis of the Pumpkin-King Throne of 1696 precipitated the War of the Pumpkin-King Succession against the Duchy of Poppenheim, the army of Prince Peter was quite sizable and ready for the conflict.The progression of the war saw the Bombastik infantry progress from regiments featuring central companies of pikemen, surrounded by musketeers, to all-musketeer units.  While Grenadier companies were converged together to form grenadier \"regiments\", there were also some standing regiments of Grenadiers in the army.  In fact, this is in sharp contrast to the strictures of the Edict of Boomplatz.  The Prince often explains away his violation of the Edict by claiming that the armies of the Principality are not proper armies of greater Furstenberg, but the droits of nobility, due to him as a peer of the margravate.  Curiously, the Prince's foe, the Duke of Poppenheim, does not even bother to explain away why he has Grenadier companies within his armies - also strictly against the codes found within the Edict.The cavalry of Bombastia consists of dragoons and armored cavalry, but also of units of Cossacks from two main Urbik tribal areas within Simia.  The Dukon Cossacks and the Arzov Cossacks both have feudal agreements with Bombastia, and the Prince's family.The artillery of Bombastia differs from Poppenheim chiefly in the employ of small 3-pounder regimental guns, attached to an infantry regiment, nicknamed \"pot guns\".  The nickname comes from the fact that the original Pot Guns were crafted, during the heyday reign of Ivan Badinov during the 30 years war.  During that time, the last of the Patchouli people were rounded up in Eastern Simia, and forced to give up all of their metal and metal objects.  This was first intended to disarm the Patchouli people, but it had the unfortunate effect of rendering them Pot-less.  The captured Patchouli Pots were subsequently melted down and poured as small cannon for the Badinov's army.  These pot guns were passed down from regimental commander to commander, until today they are still part of the regiments (which have a history going back at least fifty years to the 30 years war, and some much farther back).Tags: Great Northern War, Wargaming, Miniatures, Russia"},
{"title": "Grand Duchy of Poppenheim", "date": "Thursday, May 13, 2010", "text": "In the grand tradition of Emperor vs. Elector, Gaming with Chuck presents the Grand Duchy of Poppenheim, a petty state of the Furstenberger province of Simia - located smack dab in the middle of Balkania.The ruler of Poppenheim during the War of the Pumpkin-King Succession was Grand Duke Charles.  He comes from a long line of gourd farmers in the Poppen line.  His ambitions were to expand pumpkin patronage to not only the middle class, but also to the growing ranks of gourd-artists among his citizenry.  During the Pumpkin-King crisis of 1696, he came into dispute (over the throne of the Pumpkin-King) with Prince Peter of Bombastia, which quickly resulted in armed conflict. The three branches of the Poppenheim army were the Infantry, the Cavalry and the Artillery (not uncommon for European armies of the time, such as that of Sweden).  In the field, such an army was often divided up into three \"battles\", corresponding to a central division, and two wing divisions.  Within these, cavalry was not infrequently mixed with infantry, and it is a mistake to consider these divisions as the separate and flexible organizations found later in Napoleonic era armies.The infantry of Poppenheim was organized into Regiments, which consisted of a number of companies of Musketeers, as well as a company of Grenadiers.  The Grenadiers from a number of regiments would sometimes be converged together into a \"converged regiment\".  Each of the Royal Duchy regiments were named for the town from which they were mustered.  A number of nobles, supportive of the Duke, also raised independent regiments that were known by the name of their patron Nobleman.The cavalry are also organized into Regiments, with a number of different types.  Armored cavalry as well as dragoons are popular (the dragoons still fighting dismounted as often as mounted).  Light, irregular cavalry were sometimes hired from the Carfathian mountains to the west, being usually tribal Bosniaks.The artillery of the Poppenheim army is a strange creation.  The individual guns are owned by skilled \"artisan\" artillery crewmen, and serve the Duke and his army at their own will (and for money).  Because of this, artillery is somewhat unreliable, especially strategically.  While a gun and crew may show up on a battle, in support of the army, there is no guarantee that it will follow the army on the march to the next engagement.Tags: miniatures, Great Northern War, Sweden, wargamingA few friends of mine and I share in some Imagi-Nation wargaming activities concerning an imaginary region of the world known as Balkania.  In the words of Eric the Wise (one of the original crafters of the concept of Balkania), Welcome to Balkania! It is a fictitious land of petty princes and minor monarchs, located East of Venice, South of Vienna, West of Istanbul, and North of the Nile.A good bit of the emphasis has been on late 19th century (roughly from about 1850-1915) period.  Look for games, coming up at the Guns of August.  Some of my own writings on the topic can be seen here.  Notably, I have developed the imagi-nation of the Margravate of Furstenberg, and their centuries old foe, the Earldom of Rumpwhistle (later, after the revolution, the Confederated Cantons of Rumpwhistle).  This has been accompanied with histories and military unit information, as well as some wargaming plans.  The island of San Balkano was devised to serve as the backdrop for fictional Spanish-American War gaming.  More coming about these fictional nations.  Other states, created by my co-conspirators, include Trans-Turkylvania, the Kingdom of the Three Sicilies, The Empire of Vulgaria, Kingdome of Payepal, and others.However, inspired by a desire to do some 18th century wargaming (Age of Enlightenment), as well as all of the inspiring 18th century Imagi-Nation work done on the internet (the activity is not limited to, but is broadly connected to the website Emperor vs. Elector), the editorial staff of Gaming with Chuck has decided to venture into the early 18th Century of Balkania.Taking the nation of Furstenberg as my starting point, I wanted to come up with a couple of minor states that could serve for Marlborough-era wargaming, using fairly generic armies.  This then morphed into developing some Great Northern War armies, but using them to represent my fictional principalities.  This is leading to the conflict known alternately as the \"Great Northern Furstenberg War\", or the \"War of the Pumpkin-King Succession\".The gently rolling farmland and pasture country of the Simian plains of northern Furstenberg (later to become the agricultural province of Simia) was home to two petty principalities.  Those were the Grand Duchy of Poppenheim, and the Principality of Bombastia.  These self-styled petty kingdoms were really based around the medieval castles of some local barons, and their dependent villages and market-towns.  However, one thing led to another, and in 1696, when the annual Pumpkin Faire was held at the Church of St. Gourdfellow, the judges of the annual Pumpkin-King contest were all found poisoned.  The clergyman present, Father Squashnot of the Holy See of Balkania (later the kingdom of Payepal) declared the office of Pumpkin-King to be unclaimed, and the throne vacant.  The two competing nobles, Duke Charles of Poppenheim and Prince Peter of Bombastia each claimed the throne, and the gauntlets were thrown.  It could only end in war.The blue uniforms of Poppenheim bear a passing resemblance to the uniforms of the Swedish Army in the Great Northern War.It has been mentioned that the green uniforms of Bombastia can sometimes be compared favorably to the uniforms of the Russian Army from the same conflict.  It is not the place of the editorial staff of \"Gaming with Chuck\" to decide.Anyway, watch for further posting on this project, and also to watch painting progress.  The staff will probably wait for the release of the new WSS (War of the Spanish Succession) figures from Wargames Factory before starting this project, but who knows?"},
{"title": "Spanish American War AAR - May 6", "date": "Sunday, May 9, 2010", "text": "A recent ODMS game that I presented on May 6 was a pretty good success.  There were six players, three to a side, commanding a Division of Spanish (4 brigades) vs. a Division of US (4 brigades).The Spanish held a hill - La Colina Verde - which is central in the hills south of Puerto Gris (the capital of San Balkano).  The US force, approaching from the South, come up all south east of the Azzuro river, which cuts through the hills.  The Spanish force was located in the hills, and the central hill had a walled town on it, which was defended by a brigade of Spanish.The Spanish troops had been on the island for years, fighting against Insurrectos, so were quite experienced in jungle fighting, and using the cover of the island to their best advantage.  Because of this, they gained an advantage when firing from under cover in the jungle.The rules used were a simplified version of \"A Splendid Little War\" - a version of my age of rifles wargaming rules also used for RJW and other gaming.The US approached, as expected, heavily in the center and a little bit on the eastern flank.  There, on the East, they got held up by battalions of Spanish Foreign Legion in the jungle for a few turns, before moving past them.  On the west, they moved up along the Azzuro river, and met a few units of Spanish Naval Infantry that tied up that brigade.In the center, the two brigades assaulting the hill were peppered by Spanish artillery (German guns, of course), but eventually made it to the hills and fought over the defenses.  The Spanish, once fighting inside the towns, were bested by the US troops.A good game.   Tags: miniatures, wargaming, Balkania"},
{"title": "War is Declared! - Spanish American War", "date": "Wednesday, May 5, 2010", "text": "Over at the ODMS website, here, and here there are articles about an upcoming Spanish American War game.This game features the rules I wrote (borrowing heavily from influences such as the Brom Standard rules, as well as the Jackson Gamers RCW rules) for both RJW and RCW, but modified for the Spanish American War.I borrowed the Brom mechanism of activating brigades (each about 3-6 units) by card flip.  Each side also has a \"bonus\" card in the deck, which allows for a bonus move by one brigade.The main changes to the rules include changes to reflect the Spanish smokeless gunpowder - while they are under cover in jungle/forest, they can fire out but can not be fired at.  Also, I disassociated the morale level of a unit from it's size.  It is now possible to have different sized units, and big units with low morale, and small units with high morale.  I'll report back after some playtesting how this goes, and it may make its way into the RCW rules.ChuckTags: Spanish American War"},

{"title": "Blitzkrieg - Used for other Games", "date": "Wednesday, April 14, 2010", "text": "I recently came across an article over at Lead Doesn't Bleed that discusses his love affair with the old TAHGC classic, Blitzkrieg.  Evidently, the author of Lead Doesn't Bleed is active on the Consimworld Blitzkrieg Board as well.He, it seems, uses the game (and the mythical countries presented therein) as the setting for other gaming activities, and most recently has started building up armies to play Cold War Commander set in that world.Years ago, I did something similar with the game Russian Campaign, also from TAHGC.  I set up forces for the Soviet and German side, that corresponded to platoons and companies in the OGRE gaming world, then I moved them around.  I had a repair/reinforcement schedule and rules for what else was happening in the world (partisans/insurgents, economy changes, diplomacy, strategic strikes, etc).  I played it out.  This was during the brief time I lived in West Virginia, in 9th grade (the same time period where I got interested in both Historical Miniatures and Roleplaying).Anyway, I think this is a great idea for Cold War Commander.  A similar application could be something like the mythical countries that one can generate for AK-47 (see a nice review here).  For fun see the AK-47 army event sheets here.  Those events are all rolled up before the battle, and really make each game a mini-campaign.The world of Blitzkrieg is a large continent, crisscrossed with roads, rail lines, and encompassing every sort of major terrain (from swamps and forests to mountains and deserts).  The west is dominated by the Blue Empire of Azurnerreich, and the east is controlled by the Red State of Krasnynorad.  In between, five smaller satellite states make things interesting.  In the west, we have Nord Walkure and Sud Walkure (both in the Blue Hegemony), while in the east we have New Endor and San Estados as states under the Red Shadow.  In the center there is Calaedia, which is almost neutral, but leans to the Red (Krasnynorad).  Some very interesting things can be done with this simple structure.Tags: wargames"},
{"title": "From a friend of mine - Speed painting Napoleonics", "date": "Tuesday, April 13, 2010", "text": "My friend Carl penned this interesting missive.  A DNA induced requirement to produce more and more painted Napoleonic figures in any scale can be really frustrating if one does not paint quickly, with extra social negatives if one is not a master painter from birth. The quality painting of J. Croswhite, E. Ackerman, and C. Turnitsa shines as examples of what can be. If you are not one of these gentlemen, we’re here to help.First, find all the painting related articles and pamphlets. Throw away one fifth of them, as the authors are master painters who make everything look easy or have legions of “employees” to paint for them or can afford ten dollar ounces of paint.. Throw away another fifth, as the schemes only work for a very specific army or navy, and the author left something out anyway so yours will never look as good as his. You can keep the next fifth, about keeping brushes clean, using good brushes and paint, securing good lighting, as this is good advice. The last fifth is up to you to keep or not, free will and all and maybe it works for you.If though, you forget to clean brushes because your cat and child are destroying the house and you need to intervene, if the lighting isn’t great because you’re on a budget, if the only one painting is you, if your buddies aren’t into assembly line painting or team painting is going to crash into the giant mollusk named “Bob”, wonderful fellow, brings pizza and all, but has to be watched, this is your article.If you are tough enough for some social stigma, if your fellow gamers can handle the concept, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat. Not in the game, you need to be beaten if you do, but in the strategy of painting.First, make up the nations and their forces. This is all kinds of liberating, because now you can be painting Napoleonic Hawaiians instead of a lace drowned Hussar. You can pick which figures fit your painting style, rather than slogging through required forces that don’t have any interest and will be sold off or dumped half painted. Just out of the blue, let us take Payepally armies. These are dressed in Landswehr uniforms, because it’s my army and I said so. Landswehr uniforms can be used up to the Civil War, so changing your mind is facilitated. Make sure your rules don’t require a gun park of more than two guns. Cossacks may be crud in most rules, but they paint easy and you can write your own rules.If you can get your spouse to promise to help paint and she doesn’t, well, par for the course, my friend.Get the figures out of the bags, clean them of extra metal or plastic unless that’s your look, dump them all into a box (war is rough), and take them outside and primer them black. If you primer indoors with no ventilation you should  eat the can, as it is kinder and quicker. Buy an oven for the garage and use it to dry the figures or melt them if plastic. I can’t defend against all the stupid after all. When dry, dry brush them white. Don’t go nuts, you’ve got a hundred figures to do, three different branches, and if you keep adding figures to the total you’ll give up and take up haiku, I promise.While that is drying, look at the paints in hand and decide your uniform from those. “Honest, sweetie, I’m being frugal, I’m not buying any new paints for this”. But if you do, crafty places tend to have really big bottles of paint comma water soluble, for not much. Write All Your Decisions Down, change them maybe once or twice, and then cast the decisions in stone. It’s the only way my friend. BTW, one of the fifths you tossed was about how your work environment needed to be right for –you-. I cannot help you there, as wife, children, pets, friends, and telemarketeers have a radar for when you want to paint, and will do everything in their power to make sure you can’t. I suggest feigning no interest at all in what you are doing, and as long as you look lump like, they’ll all leave you alone. True story, although my family was keyed to me merely picking up a brush. Unemployment and school age children are great for getting things painted, but it’s tough to maintain the miniatures budget in the same time frame. Finding a job that lets one paint is just an urban legend.Anyhow: if you are really strong, Nappy armies frequently put covers over things, oilskins over hats, fabric around gun locks, overcoats over everything, etc. These are excellent ideas for speed painting, will not win you any awards. But your forces will be done, bringing a smug smile to your face while your fellow gamers moan about the slows. Of course, you may wind up with an army you can’t use because everyone else changed scale or period while you were out getting cheetos, but you takes your chances, and you get to paint an oppo army, so good for you.Get clean big brushes. Paint hat and coat the same color, don’t do the hat if oilskinning. Paint the pants, if a different color. Use smaller paint brushes. Paint the flesh colors and the rifles. Be careful but not obsessive because if this works right one of the later paints will bury your mistakes. Paint the blacks of the leather and fabrics, and if you’re smart it’ll all be black  Get even smaller brushes. Paint the metals, and be obsessive with this. Paint the facing colors.  With really good small brushes, go back and neaten everything up. Do it again. One more time. Have someone else look because they will find things instantly that you missed. Neaten up one more time. Go to hardware store, replace brushes you forgot to clean. Stop chewing on the paint brushes, you’re scaring the cats.Carefully carry it all out to the garage, pick a very special wood stain of the lighter persuasion, and wash down the figures. Wait five minutes, brush off the blobs. Wait  five more, brush off the blobs. Wait five more more, brush off the blobs. Check often during the drying time, because once the blobs set it’s ugly, especially over light colors. If sticky, put out in sun to dry. If still sticky, chuck it, sell an organ, and buy the army you want from a painting service. If not sticky, touch up the light colors by dry brushing or dotting, then coat with matt lacquer. Make sure the lacquer doesn’t cloud up. Really, at this stage, make sure the lacquer doesn’t cloud up. No, Really. Not to worry, five or six armies and you’ll have this down to a science or be watching televised poker as a hobby.Cranking out speedy armies is a good way to irritate people. Why I recall buying a set of figures from a fellow who’d had them for five years untouched, I used them in the game next week. Really honked him off for years. Speedy armies is way to get into the game before interest shifts to poker or boardgames or 15mms. Speedy armies don’t mind being sold on e-bay, or life leaves you starting over again.Over to you."},

The troops included those of the Order as well as the Estonian troops (Chuds) totaling about 4000.The exiled prince Alexander Nevsky of Novgorod was begged to come back by the people when they knew that the Teutonics were coming to get them, so they begged Alexander to come back - which he did.  He hooked up with his brother Andrei. Their forces consisted of the Druzhina (bodyguards) of the two princes, plus Pagans and Eastern Orthodox Christian troops (total about 5000).The battle was fought over the thick ice of Lake Peipus and the attached Lake Pskovskoe (now you know why that lake is never remembered).  The knights and their allies battled the main line of the Russians for hours, when Alexander had his numerous archers join the fray.  That disordered the Teutonics, and when the light Russian cavalry appeared, they fled back over the frozen lake.  On the far side they began to rally and gather for a counter-charge, but by that time the thinner ice at the edge of the lake began to give way, and (according to legend and the Eisenstein movie made under Stalin's regime) the knights crashed through the ice to their frozen watery grave.Regardless of the outcome, it is a great medieval battle, and worthy of a Wayne presentation (he has the Teutonic figures, I am sure).All fought (originally) on April 5, 1242.Tags:"},

There were a couple of personnel snafu's but it all came together nicely.  From my perspective, it was a really nice convention.At the last minute, the senior leadership asked John Desmarais and yours truly to help with the organization of gaming.  We did what we could, and organize a few important events (RPGA D&D, Pathfinder, Project:Crusader, Quickfire Starfighters, Delta Files, Visible Dungeon, and demo games from Privateer Press and Steve Jackson Games, among others).  This meant dropping our own plans to run a number of roleplaying sessions (Champions, Pulp Hero, Castles & Crusades and Mutant Future - to name the candidates).  This was going to be a Neptune City heavy year for us, but alas - it was not meant to be, mes amis.Even with the lateness of the planning, the room was full almost throughout the weekend.  Once, around 2am on Saturday night, the room was down to three games being played (horrors), but for the most part, Friday Evening, and all day and night Saturday the room was full.  It was even quite heavily utilized on Sunday.  A good year.In order to contribute somewhat, even though there was little in the way of RPGs or Miniatures being offered by \"Gaming with Chuck\", there were a number of boardgames.  These included:Several games of Manhattan - a SdJ winner from 1994, and quite a fun game to play.Also tried Small World.  A fun little near-wargame.  What surprises me about this one is that it was originally based on a map of Europe (as Vinci).Jon K, Justin G and I played a game of Carolus Magnus.  Vicious! Finally, John D brought his new version of Cosmic Encounter.  We played a bunch of hands of this game.  What a great game - and it has certainly stood the test of time!All in all - a good convention.  I am sure that I will help out (if allowed) with MarsCon 2011 in some way.  But more importantly, I hope I can run a game or two!Tags: boardgames"},

Second I hope that all will have a better year this year than last.The only gaming items that were given or received in the immediate family this year was Apples to Apples, which our daughter Heidi absolutely loves.  It's a good game, and especially easy to lure non-gamers into the ranks with.  Some of the answers in our games, and even more so - some of the justifications for those answers - have been great.  The dearth of games as presents will be dealt with in the post-Christmas hobby spending that takes place in these parts at both Marscon and the Williamsburg Muster (two local conventions, one being Sci-Fi and Fantasy, and the other Wargaming and Boardgaming).Now, as to actual gaming that took place over the holiday break - we played a couple of games.  These included the already mentioned Apples to Apples, but also Blokus, Wooly Bully, Ticket to Ride, Settlers of Catan, Rummy, Gin-Rummy, 10 Days across the USA, Tara, Carcassonne, and Cosmic Encounters.  All good games, all played when we had various guests visiting.  Sadly, everyone who played was already a gamer, so we did not introduce any new members into the hobby.  But that will happen, I am sure of it, and soon.Tags: Yehhuda - a gaming blogger (who has the kindness of linking to Gaming with Chuck) has a truly excellent article from last year that introduces Euro-Games, also known as designer games or German games.These are the sorts of boardgames that are usually at our house (also known as the world-headquarters/secret bunker for publication of Gaming with Chuck), and frequently make an appearance at weekly meetings of ODMS.Go.

{"title": "Post Apocalypse Gaming - what gives?", "date": "Saturday, November 14, 2009", "text": "Okay, so I admit it, I have long been a Gamma World junkie (although these days I must admit that I am secretly more attracted to Mutant Future than Gamma World - it's free and available now).Traveling, with your mutant mates, across the wasteland.  Stop in at a friendly village for some radiation-free melons handed out by lovely green-skinned girls, trading a rusty hubcap for some referee whistles (valuable goods), and having that bad infestation of glowing slugs on your left tentacle be treated by the local ripper doc.  And then after all that rest and relaxation, its off to the local robot guarded missile silo for valuable copper, or into the nest of the angry mutant crocodile-men, or hauling yourself up 200 meters to the robot-operated algae skyfarm to rob parts and food.  All part of a normal day in the life of a typical post-apocalypse hero.But the overall idea of post apocalypse gaming really depresses me.  That is - if it is realistic.  The futures of settings like Mad Max (where the oil dries up, and civilization collapses), or Twilight 2000 (depressing third world war, and civilization collapses), or Morrow Project (civilization collapses, with real effects of radiation, disease, etc), or Planet of the Apes (Apes win, civilization collapses).  You get the idea.  If it is a little too close to home, or too realistic (think - Threads or Day after Tomorrow), then it is just too much of a downer to be a fun game.But it the whole thing is a total lark, and absolutely preposterous - such as the future radioactive playground of Gamma World (still potentially depressing, but who can stay down for long in the world of the polyester-devouring Yexil), or the Barbarian sword-fest of Robert Adams' Horseclans novels, or further fun with Sterling Lanier's Hiero books (who hasn't dreamt of riding a telepathic warmoose) - then it can be a whole lot of fun.This is what lured me back into the genre with Mutants and Death Ray Guns, but I am also thinking of running a game of Mutant Future at MarsCon in January.  If I do I will do a mixed lot of characters (2x Pure Strain Humans, 2x Mutant Humans, 2x Mutant Animals), and probably revolve around rescuing a young mutant child from a group of brigands living in an old military site of the Ancients.  Warbots, androids, zombies, mutants galore, traps, radioactive pits - the fun is just bubbling out of me (or is that the lo mein from dinner?) and I haven't even written down anything yet.I guess I gotta do a quest for miniatures (this sort of game DEMANDS miniatures - when else would I get a chance to use my green mutant in a house coat?), and build some suitable terrain.  The good news is that it will all be useful for Mutants and Death Ray Guns, as well.Some fun blog reports out there.  First, Society of Torch, Pole and Rope has a nice write up on the classic Gamma World Deathbot for Mutant Future.  Second, Savage AfterWorld has an interesting link to a conversation about incorporating Mutant Future into Hackmaster.  Bizarre.

Then, based on a 3d6 Q check, he may change 1, 2, or 3 aspects of the weather (either temperature, cloud cover, or wind).Empathy - As Telepathy, but affects all models within Short range.Life Leech - treat as Telepathic Scream, out to Short Range.  If any target is knocked-out, then the Mutant receives a Force Field.Displacement - Whenever the Mutant receives an attack that results in a Knock Down, Kill, or Gruesome Kill result then that Mutant immediately rolls 3d6 against Q.  If it is Knocked Down, then it must score 1 success to Displace.  On a Kill it must score 2 successes, and on a Gruesome Kill it must score 3 successes.  If it succeeds, then the model is placed, in a random direction, one Medium stick away.  Note that it will not displace into a harmful situation (i.e. - mid air, over a lava pit, in front of an onrushing hovertrain, etc).Acid - treat as Poison.Emit Radiation Field - As Radiation Energy Projection, but affects all models within Medium stick.Electrical Generation - Electricity Hand-to-Hand attack.  Lethal against Robots and Androids.Resistance to Mental Attacks - Mental ShieldTotal Resistance to Mental Attack - Mind BlockImmune - as Absorption towards a particular type of attack (Radiation, Heat, Sonic, Light)Precognition - Danger SenseHeightened Intelligence - as per PsychometryRadioactive - On a successful Hand-to-Hand attack, target must make a Radiation Check.Coated in Poison, Acid - as per PoisonTelekinesis - as Telekinetic Disarm (may also grab other small objects)Repulsion Field - as Telekinetic ShieldMobility - treat as Medium MovementManipulative Vines - treat as EntangleIncreased Metabolism - requires 2 food per week.Molecular Disruption - The Mutant may make an attack as per a Death Ray Gun, except it is Lethal against all targets.  When using this mutation, the Mutant is immediately knocked unconscious (whether it is successful or not).  The Mutant must eat two Food per week.Symbiotic Attachment - Whenever the Mutant makes a H-t-H attack, and scores either a Kill or Gruesome Kill, the target is instead Controlled (as per Telepathy).  The controlling Mutant may make the victim do whatever he/she likes, but it must remain in Contact with the controlling Mutant.Mass Mind - When in contact with other Mutants with Mass Mind, this allows all Mental Mutations to be employed as a \"group effort\".  This means that all attempts to use Mental Mutations will be treated as always having a minimum of 1 success.Chameleon Powers - May start game in AmbushCarapace, Armor - Treat as Flak JacketFear Generation - TerrorIntuition - Danger SenseFear Impulse - treat as PhobiaShoot/Spit Poison - treat as Short Range attack, if successful, roll vs. Poison as with a Needle Gun attack.Levitation - FlyAttraction Odor - AllureSmall - Ground movement is reduced by one category (not below Short Stick).  Also, all ranged attacks against this mutant are at -1.Density Increase - Short range.  With 1 success, may make the target Larger or Smaller by 1 category, for 1 turn.  With 2 successes, the change is permanent.  With 3 successes, the change may be 2 categories.  The categories are - Small, Normal, Big, Huge.Anti-Life Leech - Whenever attacked by Life Leech or Telepathic Scream, the results are automatically reversed.Tags: mutants, gamma world, miniatures, wargamesI am really excited about the new game from Ganesha that I picked up at Fall In.I immediately set to translating all my favorite Gamma World encounters into SoMaDRG rules, and found that there are a good number of GW mutations that don't appear in the new Ganesha game.So I started writing up the old mutations in the new rules.  Here are a few . . . more will be published here in a PDF document, soon.Poison Susceptability - The mutant is adversely affected by poison (more so than usual).  This has two game effects - first, when checking for the effect of poison needle gun hits against the mutant, add +1 to the dice (so it must make a check on 3-6, vs. 4-6).  Second, when checking to see if the Mutant's Q goes up, from being attacked by Poison, add +1 to the dice (so the target's Q goes up on 5-6, rather than just 6).Dissolving Juices - Treat as Acid (or Poison).Cryokinesis - Treat as Energy Projection/Cold.Devolution - Short range attack.  With 1 success, the target chooses one mutation that does not work for the rest of this game.  With 2 successes, the mutant making the attack chooses one mutation that does not work for the rest of the game.  With 3 successes, the mutant making the attack chooses one mutation that is gone permanently.  Attacks against non-mutated Humans increase Q by 1 for one game (with 1 or 2 successes) or permanently (with 3 successes).Dual Brain - Treat as Psychometry, but also grant 1 additional Mental Mutation.Illusion - The Mutant creates an Illusionary Figure.  Anyone within Medium range of the figure must make a 3D6 vs Q test.  If they get 3 success, then they can ignore the Illusion for the rest of the game.  2 successes means that they can ignore the Illusion for this turn.  1 success means that the target is transfixed for this turn.  No successes  means that they are transfixed until the illusion moves out of range.  If any other figure touches the illusion, it disappears.  When a figure controlling an illusion rolls for activation, it may choose to activate itself, or the illusion (which always moves Medium).Light Generation - Generate a flash of light.  Anyone within Short range of the Mutant must make a 1d6 Q check.  Failure means that they target is transfixed for a turn.Physical Reflection - Treat as Absorption.Reflection - Treat as Absorption, but also immune to Life Leech.Total Healing - Whenever affected by Radiation or Poison, make a 1d6 v. Q check - with success, the effects of Radiation or Poison can be ignored.Speed Increase - SprintHeightened Phys Attribute (Strength) - +1 HTH CombatWill Force - Once per game, the character can automatically make 1d a success, in a C or Q check.Heavy Armor - Treat as a force field (negates a potential loss in Combat, ranged or hand-to-hand) working on a 5+, and no longer effective after rolling a 1.  Except Heavy Armor does not take an energy cell to operate.Immune to Poison - Ignore effects from poison and poisoned needlers.Horns - Treat as Hand-to-Hand specialist (+1 in close combat).Mental Control of Body - Once per game, the mutant may take complete control over his body.  He may Sprint and also receive +1 in Close Combat for 1 turn.Magnetic Control - Treat as Telekinetic Disarm but only against weapons with a metal component.Teleportation - The Mutant may teleport itself to any other spot on the board (or out of combat, by teleporting off the board), once per game.  The mutant makes a 1d6 check v. Q, and if it fails it lands \"knocked down\".Tags: mutants, gamma world, miniatures, wargames"},

{"title": "Campaign System for Craftees", "date": "Tuesday, September 22, 2009", "text": "More on this later, but here is an idea (for comment, please) for a campaign system to be used with a simple wargame system (should work for any era).  I proposed this originally for Craftees players.The thing I was thinking of for a Craftees campaign would be something relatively simple (in terms of details) but still stylistically fun.  Maybe a simple point-to-point movement map, with some nice army markers made out of craftee-parts.  Whatever period it would be for, use small armies (maybe 6-12 units) and simple battlefield rules (the Thomas rules would be great here).  Mark three armies on the map for each side.Each node on the map would have a basic terrain type, dictating the type of battlefield (i.e. - open, hilly, wooded, river crossing, etc)Alternate moving.  First player chooses an army marker to move, and rolls 1d6.  On a 2+ he moves the marker one node.  Then he picks another (or the same) marker, and rolls again - this time a 3+.  Then a 4+, 5+ and 6+ (meaning a maximum of 5 moves in a row).  If at any time, he fails a dice roll, then the order changes to the other player.Whenever a player moves an army marker onto another army marker, there is a fight.  Both sides get 4d6 to determine attacker/defender.  If one side outnumbers the cavalry of the other side, they get +1d6 for each unit of light cavalry more than their opponent, and +1d6 for each 2 units of heavy cavalry.  Both sides roll their dice, and high roller gets to decide (after seeing the battlefield) attacker or defender.  The defender then picks side of table, and sets up army.  The attacker moves units on first turn.Limit the game to a certain number of turns (or play to the written victory conditions if using the Thomas rules).Once an army loses, it must retreat a d3 nodes (must move away from enemy, cannot encounter new enemy, cannot double back on same nodes - if it cannot do this, it is eliminated).  Once an army loses twice, it is removed from the map.  The winner is the player with armies left once his opponent is all gone.If the campaign has multiple players, then the players not involved in a battle may take turns challenging a player on the other side to a \"raid\".  A raid is played with half the units of a normal game, and if successful scores \"operational points\".  If one side or the other accumulates 3 operational points, they can be spent to remove a \"loss\" from an army marker (remember that two losses make an army marker disappear from the campaign map).  Raid losses do not count towards making an army marker disappear (since they aren't based on army markers, but take place, somewhere nebulously defined as \"the front\").  Raid battles always end when the main campaign battle ends, if it is not a victory at that pooint, then neither side gets an \"operational point\".To Do - (1) print a sample nodal Campaign Map, (2) publish some notional army lists based on the Thomas rules."},

Stopping them are some quick moving Proletariat horse units.  Tschanka's anyone?A good chapter on Deniken's retreat can be found here:Tags: Russian Civil WarOkay, lets see if I can write a more lucid report than last time.I spent a little bit of time putting together two units out of a package of WF Numidians this weekend, and wanted to report on it.First of all, organization.  I am doing two units of skirmishers for Warhammer Ancient Battles with these figures, but in order to maximize usefulness I will base them on WRG basing (two figures to a 60mmX30mm base).  Each unit will have 14 figures in it.I chose to model a standard bearer, leader (with sword) and musician as part of each unit.  That left 11 skirmishers in addition.  For the first unit I chose slings as their main weapon, and for the second unit I chose the bow that comes in the package.My leaders and musicians were identical.  I chose the ornate helmeted head, as well as a sword for the leader.  I chose an unhelmeted head for all other figures in the unit, and the musician is given the curved metallic horn.  For the standard bearer, there are two ornated poles in the set (presumably unit standards).  I used these, unmodified.  The more ornate one (for no particular reason) with the disc and the crescent, I gave to the archer unit.  The other one (with the \"horsetail\") I gave to the slinger unit.I chose a variety of arms and arm poses for the warriors of each unit, and also the heads are all at different angles.  It took me only a few hours to clean and glue together all 28 figures - not much more than it would have taken to sort and clean a similar number of lead/tin figures.The next step (painting) gave me a bit of a quandary.  I could have taken a couple of routes, but I'll describe the one I did.In order to paint figures this scale, I usually will mount them on popsicle sticks with a dot of white glue, and then remove the finished figures to glue to bases.  This might have worked, but with the plastic figures, I was unsure.  So I have glued them directly to the bases (which is quite spacious, since they are on WRG light infantry style basing).  I will proceed to spray and paint them on those bases, and then decorate the bases once the figures are completed.My next steps are to spray the figures black, dry brush them white (my usual technique) and then paint in all the detail layers over that.  I'll report back when I am finishes (and will test my photo skills to see if they have improved).ps- note, the term Nubian was not used once in this article.Tags: numidians"},
{"title": "The Passing of Rich Villella", "date": "Monday, August 31, 2009", "text": "I will always think of Rich Villella as a very good friend and also a good wargamer.  I met him, first, at Campaign Headquarters, in the mid 80s when I was a shop clerk for Joe Legat.  Rich and I spoke a couple of times about different wargaming topics, which led to conversations about girls, music and a number of other topics.  Eventually, he got around to inviting me to wargame with the Williamsburg crowd that gamed (in those days) at a training building of Colonial Williamsburg. I started attending those gaming sessions (weekend nights) a couple of times here and there (work and school permitting) and Rich was always a gentleman (as were the rest of the club).  Rich always inspired me, in those days, not only with his expansive knowledge of military history, but also his welcoming friendliness; his eagerness to share a game with someone new; and his open minded approach not only to game ideas, but to any sort of conversation topic.  After that, for a couple of years (while I was still working at the hobby store and an undergraduate) I would do a number of contract painting projects for Rich.  It was always a good relationship, for not only would I get to paint new topics, but I would also benefit from Rich's knowledge of history.  After college, I saw Rich on occasion on weekend game sessions, when I lived in Williamsburg, and continued to see him from time to time. A few years back I heard that Rich had retired, and we saw each other again (after some time of sporadic contact).  It was as if no real time had passed in between - we took up our friendly relationship and conversations on historical topics (mostly Ancient warfare, Napoleonic history, and more esoteric things, like Garibaldi and the Reunification of Italy).  Just earlier this year, Rich hosted a Napoleonic game at the Hangar, which I played in eagerly (using Rudy Scott Nelson's rules - which Rich introduced me to years earlier, and which I still enjoy playing).  I was glad for the experience.  Just before the first Williamsburg Muster (our local convention - of which Rich was totally supportive, and served on our committee), he ran a French Foreign Legion game, which was a lot of fun as well.Then, just a few days ago, I received the dreadfully sad news that Rich had passed away.  The wash of sadness still hasn't left me.  The world will be a much hollower place without my friend Rich in it."},

{"title": "RCW Equipment Series - The FT-17", "date": "Friday, August 28, 2009", "text": "Renault FT-17An excellent light tank of the early stages of WWII (France, 1940), was also used in the Russian Civil War, and a number of other conflicts/theaters (Rif War 1925-27; Spanish Civil War 1936-39).  The FT-17 originally came into service during the Great War, during 1917.  Before the end of that conflict nearly 3,000 would see service.This tank was used (evidently) by both sides (Red and White) during the civil war.  Notably, the Bolshevik government had the Krasnoye Sormovo Factory reverse engineer a number of captured, burned-out FT-17s and produce the first soviet-built tank - a copy of the FT-17, named the \"Freedom Fighter Comrade Lenin\" (now housed at the Kubinka tank museum).  The factory would go on to produce T-34s for the great patriotic war.  A discussion of the technical details of the Russian Renault can be found at Skoblin's History Blog.The FT-17 was the first tank to appear in Russia during the Civil War.  They arrived, in a shipment of 20 tanks, in the port of Odessa, in December of 1918, to support French and Greek troops fighting the Bolsheviks.  In subsequent fighting, six of these initial 20 were lost to the Reds.  From then on, the FT-17 would appear on both sides of the conflict.  They continued to be supplied to allied troops fighting against the Reds.  Most tanks supplied to the White generals were actually British tanks (Mark V Heavy, Mark A Medium, Mark B Medium). [See the excellent \"Armored Units of the Russian Civil War\" from Osprey Books, by D. Bullok and A. Deryabin for more details.  A preview copy from Google Books is viewable hereSome very nice websites showing scale models of the FT-17 are here and here.For wargaming, wonderful FT-17 models are made by MiniFigs and also QRF.  I have the latter, and they were easy to assemble, and look good on the field of battle.  I will try to take some pix next time they see action.Tags:"},

We visited Dragon's Hoard gaming shop there (owned by a nice fellow, and long time friend, Harry), and I picked up a copy of this book.It is great!  Preserves all of the goodness of the original (1977) version of the game, and improves upon it without it becoming unplayable (which, I'm afraid, is my opinion of many of the other versions - T20, MegaTraveller to a certain extent, T4, and so on).What a great game - now if I only had time to run a game.Tags: traveller, role playing game, science fiction"},
{"title": "Historicon 2009 - a great time!", "date": "Monday, July 20, 2009", "text": "Historicon 2009 was a great time for me and my friends from ODMS!!  This was the 25th anniversary, and was a well attended convention, apparently.  This gargantua of wargaming cons will be moving to Baltimore next year (amid some disappointment from the fans who have been coming to Lancaster for two decades), but I will leave all that politics and grumbling aside for now.  On to the report -I ran two con games - RCW and TSATF.  Both were excellent, and I got good feedback for the two scenario books I am working on.Re-connected with lots of gaming friends.Played 5 games of Hordes of the Things - my record was 1 and 4 (almost as good as I did in the DBA tournament).Played Pillars of the Earth - very good with 4 players (we did not use the expansion, with more players and different cards).  Players were Jon K, Odin B, Justin G, and myself.  Odin came in first, and I got second.  Very nice, and had a good feel from the book, although it was more than a little reminiscent to Stone Age.Played Power Grid - another very good game.  Played with the same players as Pillars (Jon, Odin, Justin and myself).  Elliott helped by flipping cards and restocking the uranium.  I won this one, but it was close throughout (an excellent game).Purchased enough Wargames Factory Celts to do a decent sized WAB army.Purchased a boxed Infantry battalion of Seven Years War Prussian Musketeers, by Crusader.  Very nice miniatures, I can't wait to paint these.I got some new rules Songs of Drums & Shakos Der Kriegskunst (from Chris)Got some light infantry and some cavalry for my Romans.  These are from Wargames Factory (like the Celts).  These guys (Tony and the rest) are one of my favorite wargaming companies out there today, which probably isn't hindered by the fact that they do the periods that I really like (colonials, zulus, and soon - Vikings!).Picked up some Litko bases for John Dent (I'll bring them on Thursday).Got plenty of British figures to do Songs of Drums & Shakos.  These are the Victrix plastics, which come in a box of 52, Flank Companies for the Peninsula Campaign was the set I got, which should give me some Light Infantry and some Grenadiers, as well as a few foot officers.  With the rifleman figures that were given away (very nice Perry figures), I should be able to do a pretty decent British collection for a skirmish game.Sold a 15mm ancient indian army - thanks Elliott, for showing it in the flea market.Picked up a copy of BattleCry from Richard Borg.  Almost bought \"Ancients\" from him, but I figured that would out for a while, while BattleCry is hard to find.  Found out that a Napoleonic version of the system is due out next year from GMT.I met Jason Salkey (Rifleman Harris) from the Sharpe's movies - very nice fellow.I saw the \"Charm City Cakes\" cake that they baked for Historicon 25th anniversary.I did not play in the WAB tournaments, but I went out with a great bunch of WAB guys for dinner to the Lancaster Brewery.  10 beers, a burger and some tira misu is a good consolation prize for not getting to play in the tournament.  Cute waitress.Tags: gaming, wargaming, miniatures, boardgames"},

Here are some photos.Here is the Hippo God from the front.  Bad photo, but you can see a stray Riverman and some female Royal Warders, doing the Elf-King's bidding (and having their paint completed) in the background.  The Hippo God himself is mounted on a Tester's plastic cement jar for painting.Here we see Sethmak from the side.  Now also appearing are the Four Jackals, also being painted.  They, and the rest of their diabolical order (desert Assassins of the Ebon Temple) should be ready for Historicon.Here we have Raza the Hunter, being completed. What you don't see in the photo (as bad as it is...) are the heads that Raza has already collected, hanging from the back of his sash.  He will be mounted as a Hero element for Hordes (60x40mm), but that allows him to be used for a number of other types, as well.  Lurker? Cleric?  Interesting.  The weighted chain he is using is a blunt instrument, so in all old-school D&D goodness, he could certainly serve as a cleric.  And the fact that he is a stealthy hunter leads one to buy into the Lurker line as well.  We'll see how it goes in Lancaster.Tags: miniatures, wargaming, Hordes of the Things, Fantasy Gaming"},

{"title": "Hordes of the Things - Two Battles", "date": "Thursday, June 18, 2009", "text": "There are some great photos of our game at Egyptoid's gaming blog (Gameroid).We played two games on Tuesday evening.  The first was my new Lunar Empire army (with help from the Horned Men - a chaos mercenary band consisting of 6 hordes elements) against Elliott's Steampunk dwarves, complete with three airboats.  The Lunars had 6xSpear, 1xHero(General), 1xMagician, and 4xHordes.The Lunars were doing well, with a 10AP to 4AP lead, when the Dwarves killed my General.  That made it 10AP to 8AP (not enough for a win for the Dwarves).  The next turn I killed another Dwarf element, giving me 12AP, which was a win.  A very, very tough fight, but a good first showing for the Lunars.The second battle was my army of the Rivermen of Bissel Stone.  A new army, based on some old Bladestorm figures, I think they were the Fishermen of Soluthurn.  The game is described online at link and link.In this battle, things went worse for me, as I fell to Elliott's dwarven army (again).  This time the dwarves traded out their airboats for much faster, but less effective, flyer elements.  Against them, I had my army of 2xBlades, 2xSpear, 2xShooter, 2xWarband, 1xHero(General), 1xCleric, and 1xLurker.  This game, I lost handily with a General kill.  Both games good, looking forward to more at Historicon.Photos compliments of Elliott.

It follows the general trend of old school wargamers doing Imaginations - imaginary nations as the basis for toy soldiers and wargaming.  The idea comes from Charles Grant, but has gotten quite popular in recent years.  See own posts last year concerning the 19th century war in Balkania for a meager example.The website Emperor vs. Elector has a great list of 18th century imaginations amongst other wargaming gems.  Great stuff, and quite imaginative.  I just can't quite figure out if what the author of Campaigns in Germania does is closer to roleplaying or wargaming.  It certainly has elements of both.Tags: wargamingAt Colonel Campbell's Barracks there is an excellent series of how-to articles, followed by a scenario and after action report, where a home-made Colonial Wargaming fort, made for gaming in the Northwest Frontier (of India) is presented.This fort is made of yogurt tubes and pink board, similar to the project that appeared on the Major General's web site some years ago.

{"title": "New Units for Hordes", "date": "Saturday, April 11, 2009", "text": "In between large amounts of school work, a conference, and other stuff, this week I got done a few dozen new units for Hordes of the ThingsMostly I was prepping, repairing, and basing some figures that were already painted.I completed the following:10 Stands of Viking type Warband (including 1 general element)4 Stands of Viking type javeling Shooters6 Stands of Medieval Longbow type Shooters (include 2 general elements)4 Stands of Lizardman Blades1 Stand of Lizardman Spear2 Stands of Eastern style Spear8 Stands of Medieval Spear (including 1 general element)And finally I did some work on my new \"Badgers of Craggen Moor\" army...This army consists of some highland badgers that I have had for years.  I think they were originally painted by and sold to me by Danny Jackson.  For the badgers I completed -  3 Stands of Blades (highland badger with claymore) 4 Stands of Shooters (highland badger with bow) 1 Stand of Hero General (The Laird of Craggen Moor, and his Game Warden) 1 Stand of (either) Hero or Cleric (Bonny Prince Badger, and his Piper)That comes to (either) 21 or 22 points, depending on whether Bonny Prince Badger is a Hero or a Cleric.  In either case, I have a few more things to add.  I want to do the Great Beast himself, a giant badger (used as either a Behemoth, Beast, or Dragon).  I also want to do a water lurker (Nessie).  I am working up plans for a stronghold as well.This gives me enough to do a good proper Medieval barbarian type army (northern raiders, Orlanthi, Immer, Northmen, Rangers, Vikings, etc).  The start of a Lizardman army.  The core of another Medieval army.  And of course, Craggen Moor.Tags: miniatures, wargames, Hordes of the things"},
{"title": "Spring Fever - a great convention in Raleigh", "date": "Monday, April 6, 2009", "text": "Spent the weekend in Raleigh at Spring Fever.  Nice little convention.  About a third of the attendees were there for a Warhammer Fantasy tournament.  The rest were nice people putting on nice games.  Saw lots of cool stuff, the coolest, perhaps, was a really nice game of Sharpe's Practice being hosted by Chris from Sash and Saber with really big metal miniatures.  Sash and Saber was the only dealer selling big figures.  Lots of very nice little toy soldiers (15mm) for sale from Ron at the Game Connection (including Xyston and Corvus Belli), and a dealer with a lot of really old board games.  Miniatures of Chesapeake was there selling everything in the world related to Flames of War.  Interesting mix of historicals and fantasy/sci-fi.  Saw Bob Bryant's fantasy game, nice presentation.  Also his Colonial battle rules.Was supposed to run Old West, instead of Darkest Africa.  All of the Old West players decided it would be cool to play Divine Right instead.  That was a good time.  I was dwarves, never could get a good alliance with a strong kingdom, but my ambassador killed the ambassador of Immer (when he challenged me to a duel), and also poisoned the King of Pon.  Our warcry (Death to Trolls) was taken up for a while, until we realized that the trolls were a hollow threat.Also played Lord of the Rings risk, and the good alliance won a military victory, scant turns before Frodo and Sam reached Mount Doom.Played lots of Hordes of the Things in 28mm - that was a hoot.  We played a big battle game on Saturday night (after Divine Right) consisting of four armies per side, and then a series of smaller battles on Sunday morning before leaving.The convention was small, but nice.  There was a really great raffle, in which I won a Pegasus Hobbies pre-painted 28mm medieval stone house.  (That will come in useful in the near future for my dark ages stuff.)  It was great hanging out with good friends - Carl, Justin, Brian, Elliott, John, Dr. Bob and Joe from Charlotte, Ed Mohrmann, Bob Bryant, and a lot of others.  And I made some new friends.  I am beginning to really like smaller game conventions.(photos courtesy of Charles Cabell, who played in the big Hordes of the Things battle on Saturday night.

{"title": "RCW game at Cold Wars", "date": "Wednesday, April 1, 2009", "text": "As mentioned earlier in Gaming with Chuck, I ran a Russian Civil War game at Cold Wars.  It was a great time.  There were eight players squeezed into a six player game, with four on the Red side and four on the White side.The scenario was quite simple, with the Reds guarding a railroad town, where they had captured a White armored train that was disabled.  The Volunteer Army had a force of infantry and cavalry (mostly Cossacks) that were closing in on the town to recapture the train.  The cossacks were led by the famous Colonel Bulgarov.  To stop this, the Bolsheviks had a number of units of infantry, including Trotsky's Red Guard, and some Chekists.  in addition, they had gotten the heavy guns mounted on the armored train into working order. The game was a great blast of fun, and came down to the last squadrons of cavalry and companies of infantry fighting in and amongst the town over the train itself.  The Volunteer Army had captured one of the cars of the train, and the Bolsheviks still held the other two, however there was more Cossack cavalry pouring into the town every minute, and most of the Bolsheviks had been dispatched.  In the end, the Red cause had given up the train, and withdrawn. The rules used are the current version of those I plan to publish later on this year, and many of the players stated that they would like to get a copy.  I better follow through with this project, it was a lot of fun and the gamers really enjoyed it!Tags: Russian Civil War, miniatures, wargames"},

{"title": "Horatius", "date": "Sunday, March 29, 2009", "text": "In Macaulay's \"Lays of Ancient Rome\" the fabulous poem about brave Horatius and his defense of the Pons Sublicius - a bridge that was threatened in the early days of the Roman Republic. This is really a stirring story, and the poem does it great justice.  If the story is new to you, then here it is - one of the expelled Kings of Rome stirred up some of the Italian tribes (Campanians, etc) against the City and they attacked, so that the exiled King could again be placed on the throne, and the fledgling Republic would be done away with.  The attack came against the Pons Sublicius bridge, and the defenders of the city needed time to destroy the bridge and keep the army out.  Brave Horatius Cocles volunteered, with two companions (Lartius and Herminius), to defend the bridge against the 30,000 strong invading army.  This they did, piling up the dead. Eventually the bridge was about to collapse, and Horatius has his two companions jump to safety, while he prays to the god of the river Tiber to protect him, and in his armor, he dives into the river, and then heroically swims to safety, as the bridge is brought down behind him.  The city is saved, and Horatius and his companions sail off into mythic History (just ask Livy).  Here is an excerpt of the terrific poem, from 1842, by Thomas Babbington Macaulay . . .     Then out spake brave Horatius,               The Captain of the Gate:    \"To every man upon this earth               Death cometh soon or late.    And how can man die better               Than facing fearful odds,    For the ashes of his fathers,               And the temples of his gods,              \"And for the tender mother               Who dandled him to rest,    And for the wife who nurses               His baby at her breast,    And for the holy maidens               Who feed the eternal flame,    To save them from false Sextus               That wrought the deed of shame?              \"Haul down the bridge, Sir Consul,     With all the speed ye may;    I, with two more to help me,              Will hold the foe in play.    In yon strait path a thousand               May well be stopped by three.    Now who will stand on either hand,               And keep the bridge with me?\"Then out spake Spurius Lartius;               A Ramnian proud was he:    \"Lo, I will stand at thy right hand,               And keep the bridge with thee.\"    And out spake strong Herminius;               Of Titian blood was he:    \"I will abide on thy left side,               And keep the bridge with thee.\"Stirring Stuff!

{"title": "Response to the \"Open Gaming\" poll", "date": "Friday, February 27, 2009", "text": "Open Gaming at Conventions        1. Do you set up games using open gaming space at conventions? Yes - Board Games  Yes - Miniatures Games  2. In your opinion should open gaming space be available: Only \"after hours\" - such as after dinner, or after the main scheduled events are through.  3. Do you bring games with you to a convention, specifically for playing in open gaming space? Yes - board games  Yes - Miniatures and Terrain         Fun quizzes, surveys & blog quizzes by             Chris B tells me that Loose Files and American Scramble are a good set of rules.  From reading them, I am intrigued enough to want to play.They use a basing of three figures per stand, and work based on \"d. points\" where the \"d.\" can stand for anything bad (damage, disorder, disintegration, democratic, diabolical, delightful, etc).  They represent the cumulative burden a unit acquires both from the receiving of casualties, and also from fatigue and loss of command and control.Movement is by dice (one or two average dice for infantry, an extra d6 for skirmishers, and an extra one or two d6 for cavalry).  Not a bad system.Bayonet and saber are resolved by comparing d6 rolls, higher rolling unit wins, difference determines results (even a unit that wins BIG takes a d. point - I like that).Musketry are resolved by rolling 1d6 per stand (or per three figures, if a skirmish unit), and rolls of a 6 cause a d. point.  Skirmish units also inflict d. points for approx half of the 5's rolled.  Not bad - nice and simple.These look pretty good - and they are free.Tags: Revolutionary War, miniatures, wargamesInteresting rules from the internet for American War of Independence.  Prompted by a quest by Brian Compton for recommended rules, and fueled by some suggestions by a friend of mine in a far off land, here are a couple of internet rules that look to be of interest.  An interesting online forum discussion on the topic is located at here.Fire and Discipline by Rudy Scott Nelson.  I always like Rudy's rules (Glory, Gard Du Corps, and others), and these are from the Deep Fried Mice website. They look interesting.  Note that there are three versions - the \"Firepower\" ruleset, which emphasizes combat.  The \"Discipline\" ruleset which emphasizes morale and command.  And the \"European\" version that emphasizes streamlined play for convention battles.  The sample armies are interesting, and they cover the British forces for the 1770s, but not the American.  They could be extrapolated, however.Bloody Backs looks to be quite good (my sort of game).  It is fast, and resolves fire by a point system, with 1 point per base (usually a 6 figure base).  To this total add 1d3, then modify by situation.  Result is number of casualties.  So a 12 figure (2 stand) unit starts with two points, rolls 1d3, adding an additional two points, but then gets this halved by target being behind hard cover (stone wall), for a total of two points.  Two casualties suffered by the target unit.  Simple, and fun.American War of Independence by Will McNally.  These rules have a similar flavor to some I have written.  Movement is simple.  Combat is based on a contested D6 roll for the entire unit.  Firing is based on rolling 2d6 to get a score of 7+, after modifiers.  Morale works the same way.  Simple, elegant.

{"title": "Ticket to Ride - the Dice Expansion", "date": "Monday, January 5, 2009", "text": "One of the Turnitsa Household's Christmas acquisitions was the Ticket To Ride Dice Expansion.  This is a nifty little add on that can easily add to any of the existing Ticket to Ride games (USA, Europe, Germany, Switzerland, or Nordic Countries - but the last might have a slight problem).The expansion has you roll each turn to see how long of a train route you can build - there are no more train car cards, and the colors of routes don't matter.  There are extra dice for building tunnels (in the versions that have them) and rules for ferries, stations, passengers, and collecting new tickets.  A nice expansion - it makes for a quite different game, but not an un-enjoyable one.  I mentioned a slight problem with Nordic Countries.  With the dice variant, the LONGEST route you can build is only 8 cars long.  That works fine for all the other board, but in Nordic Countries there is a 9 car route.  There have been two acknowledged fixes for this, including a weigh-in from Days of wonder - they are (1) pretend it is an 8 car route, or (2) ignore it when using the dice expansion.  I prefer the feel of the first of these, but what the heck - just play Nordic Countries with the standard cards.  It's not as if it isn't enjoyable that way...Tags: board games, ticket to ride"},

Once finished, they sprues are shipped and the remainder of the cost per sprue (about $4-6 per sprue?) is charged.Great idea!  It works for Columbia Games, GMT Games, Eureka Miniatures and a bunch of other companies.I put in a sprue description for something that I've wanted for some time (and in a decent quantity), and I can only assume that other ECW gamers would want too.  That is a nice, affordable, 17th century armed civilian that would be suitable for peasant mob or armed Clubmen.  These would fit into a  number of wargaming army lists for ECW, as they fought on their own vs. a number of armies (see Dorset and Wiltshire).  Similar armed figures fought for Fairfax against the Royalist army in Yorkshire in 1643.This figure could also serve very nice as armed mob in the Monmouth Rebellion, or as armed peasants for a Thirty Years War game.This is not even addressing the usefulness such figures would fill for civilians in a typical Musketeers or Pirates or ECW skirmish game.So, support the cause!  Defend ye homesteads, ye Godly men!  Take up the Cudgel and Bible and say Nay! to tyrants and blasphemers!

{"title": "Russo Japanese War at Fall In a success", "date": "Monday, November 24, 2008", "text": "The running of a Russo-Japanese War game at Fall In was a great success.  It was sponsored by ODMS and will be repeated at the Williamsburg Muster.The game had six players (three per side), and was a test of my mods to the great set of rules for Russian Civil War by the Jackson Gamers, Forward Comrades.  The mods are becoming more and more extensive, and the rules (nicknamed \"Forward for the Tsar\") will be published here in the near future.At the convention, the scenario was a contested river crossing.  We played it two times, once with just ODMS lads (with the Russians attempting to force the crossing) and once as the convention event (with the Japanese attempting to force the crossing).  The Russians won (but not neatly) both games.The only differences between the armies was a slight difference in command, a slight initiative benefit to the Japanese army, and a difference in the organization of the artillery batteries.  The Russian army was slightly bigger (10 battalions to 8 battalions of infantry), but the Japanese had a few Elite units to balance it out.  The artillery difference was three batteries of two guns for the Japanese, and two batteries of three guns for the Russians - this gave the Russians more dice per battery, but one fewer battery (the number of dice is per gun, so the total for each side was balanced.I have to say that I am looking forward to more RJW, but also the slightly connected RCW.Tags: Russo Japanese War, miniatures, wargames"},

The figures I am using are a mixture of some Peter Pig's, and also the new Russian Sailor pack from Battlefront for Flames of War.  That pack comes with 46 figures.  In the pack I got there were 5 command figures, 4 lewis gunners (I might do MG stands with them), 10 figures with drum fed SMGs (more on them later), and the remainder were riflemen.  Despite these figures being intended for WWII, the uniforms are so similar, and the rifles indistinguishable, that I decided to use them.The one problem, of course, is the SMG in the hands of 10 of the figures.  I did some research, and apparently the Bergman MP18 was used in Russia, and captured from German sources.  The figures have a drum fed SMG with an air-cooled (with the small holes) barrel.  If I trim off the drums, they will look very much like MP18's.  So that is the course I will take.  I will post pictures as they are finished.Tags: Russian Civil War, sailors"},

There are still over 200 infantry in a semi-finished state, but it is to the point of having two playable armies, new terrain, and modified rules.  I would like to run it over the holidays for the ODMS crowd.

I am not completely happy with the villages, but I got a LOT of compliments on them at the convention, so I will probably post the files for download.Third, I have been working on two articles for HMG magazine.  Details to be released later.Fourth, I have been working on a historical article about the development of the Rifle from 1860-1960 - as a theme essay to support the Theme of the 2009 Williamsburg Muster.Fifth - I have been doing some painting on 15mm Sudan figures.  I got 100 Dervish finished, another 100 half finished, and some Camel riders are in the works.Sixth - I painted some of the Krigbaum collection of fine miniatures.Seventh - I have been working on some colonial Orbats for Eric Burgess.Not bad.Looking ahead over the holiday months (second half of Nov, Dec, first half of Jan) I will probably concentrate on: 1.

{"title": "Drovian Highland Warriors", "date": "Tuesday, October 21, 2008", "text": "A lot of information has been spread around concerning the troops of Drovia (the western mountain province of Furstenburg, known for its fiercely independent tribal warriors, and the high quality of Drovian sheep).Drovian tribal chiefs each have a quota of men they are to provide to the local hetman, which will form a regiment.  There are 6 regiments spread through the mountains, one in the trading town of Katrinka, and the other five based on different valleys where sheep villages are located.  The highland clans who live in the heights over the sheep valleys provide the warriors that make up these regiments.  These men (the drovian highlanders) are natural fighters, given to tribal feuds and raids, and only require a modicum of training in the base martial arts.  Getting them to adopt a uniform, however, and to take up ways that the rest of the Furstenburg army observes is an altogether different issue.As the picture above shows, they wear a somewhat loose \"zouave\" type uniform, based on the native dress of the highland tribes.Now for the rumors:Rumor: Drovian warriors eat only raw sheep and drink their blood.  FALSE - although there are some Drovian recipes that call for raw sheep (especially small meats) for the most part, it is cooked.Rumor: Drovian warriors come to battle with their women, barefoot and barely civilized, following after the regiment to strip the enemy dead of any equipment or clothing they die with.  FALSE - Drovian women, like the mean, wear footgear almost always when outside their croft-houses.Rumor: Drovian officers do not rely on buglers or whistles to make their orders heard, but rather have a strange battle-language based on a sort of ocarina constructed from a sheep's femur.  TRUE - the distinctive sound of ocarina playing means that Drovian warriors (always adept at hiding among rocks and forests) are afoot and they mean to do mischief.Blackpowder are rules for 1700-1900.The link above goes to a playtest session highlighted at Warlord Games.The neatest thing about the Very Large acw game shown in the playtest pictures is that almost all of the empty beer bottles are at John Stallard's corner of the table.I like John Stallard.Tags: wargamesstone_fortOriginally uploaded by Land of ChuckI have been listening to a Teaching Company lecture series on the Crusades, and it is really whetting my appetite for some Medieval gaming.I am full up on activities for Fall In (Russo Japanese War, and British in Sudan), but after the convention, I might break out some of my 15mm armies, or take stock in what I still have in 28mm."},

Almost completed, also, are the officers and standard bearers.Still working on finding appropriate figures for Japanese machine guns (minifig WWI British Hotchkiss?).  Cavalry and artillery next, along with more infantry.The project is moving along nicely.Tags: Russo-Japanese War, wargamingThe Margravate of Furstenberg is a small country in the Balkans that has, through its relatively short (600 year) history, been a part of, and not a part of, various empires and alliances.Through several periods of history, Furstenberg has been more or less active in the struggle for power against other Balkan states.  Relations with her belligerent neighbor, the Earldom of Rumpwhistle, have always been a bit testy.In the latter half of the 17th century, the War for St. Helga's Baptismal raged between the two diminutive states.  Surrounding powers finally stepped in, and under the oversight of Vulgarian diplomats, a treaty was drawn up (the Vulgar Peace), which was accompanied by a multi-national edict, known as the Edict of Boomplatz, where all bomb-throwing activities by soldiery from Furstenberg was deemed outlaw activity, and in compensation to the Furstenbergers, the Rumpwhistle province of Graatz was placed under Furstenberger administration.  A curious side effect of the Edict of Boomplatz, was that no Furstenberger infantry regiments were permitted to have Grenadiers.Furstenberg is divided up into (including the Protectorate of Graatz) 7 provinces (or beyliks), each ruled alternatively by a Governor or a Bey (depending on the ethnicity of the province, or beylik).  In addition to being the local authority for collecting and providing taxes and troops to the Markgraf, each province (or beylik) is entitled to having an Elector reside when it is time to elect a new Markgraf.  Surprisingly, that even since the acquisition of Graatz which gave Furstenberg 7 provinces, there have been several tied votes for Markgraf.  This situation led to the war of Furstenberg Succession, fought in the early part of the 18th century.  With the seven provinces (or beyliks) providing 7 electors, and the Uzlov family (the traditional royal family since the early 16th century) having 2 additional electors, and the 2 military cities of Bruzlov and Smellensk, there were a total of 11 electors.  Yet the vote for the new Markgraf (Stephan Uzlov II) was challenged by the Vulgarian brother of old Markgraf Stephan I's wife (Nestor).  The vote was split, 8 votes for Stephan II and 8 votes for Nestor.  Where the additional 5 votes came from, and who cast them is still a mystery, but it incited another war (1722-1729) between Furstenberg and Rumpwhistle (with allies from Vulgaria and elsewhere).Stephan VII (1830-1907)In the second half of the 19th century a series of small wars were waged with Trans-Turkylvania over the fate of the ethnic Urbs.  The Bey of Frugalia (one of the seven Electors) is the self-professed Begler-Beg of the Ethnic Urbs (the largest majority of which do not dwell within Furstenberg, but rather across the border in Trans-Turkylvania).  Mounting raids across the Trans-Turkylvanian border, with the stated goal of protecting the interests of the Urbish people, has led to sabre rattling by both the Markgraf of Furstenberg and the Khedive of Trans-Turkylvania, and threatens to draw all of Balkania into a protracted conflict.In an upcoming series, the military details of units throughout the history of Furstenberg will be presented here, with wargaming guidelines.Tags: balkania"},

{"title": "15mm Russo-Japanese early estimates", "date": "Sunday, August 3, 2008", "text": "Over the north country whose seas are frozenSpring wind blows acrossIt is time to beat RussiaRampant for three hundred years.-- Mora Orgai, 1904.Not the most popular land wargaming period, I have been collecting and slowly painting a 15mm pair of armies for the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05.With Naval Wargamers this is a fairly popular topic, for a couple of reasons.  It is a mark of the ascendancy of Japan's Imperial Navy.  It is the epitome of Pre-Dreadnought naval development.  And the battles are fun.  And who doesn't like to poo-poo the Imperial Russian fleet (especially with such fun histories available such as this).  I believe that Big Mike (of ODMS and the Hangar) will be completing some pre-dreadnought fleets including the Japanese and Russians, at which time I would be glad to defend the Tsar's tarnished honor.Once all painted, I should have about 60-70 stands of Russian infantry, and about 50 stands of Japanese infantry.  I will have around 10-20 stands of Japanese Imperial cavalry, and about the same of Russian Imperial cavalry.  Probably another 30-40 stands of Russian Cossacks.  Add to all that some field guns (about a dozen per side), and the same number of machine guns.Currently I have the first 25 or so stands of infantry for each side close to being completed.  It is taking me about 3-4 nights to complete 25 stands of infantry, as an estimate to completion (of course, I don't, or can't, paint every night - meaning about a week for 25 stands, or 100 infantry figures).This will give me armies big enough to play any of the rule sets I am interested in, and I hope to play several and compare them.  I am basing the infantry on 4 man square bases (1\" x 1\") and the cavalry in 3 man linear bases (1.5\" x 1\").  One of the reasons for the lag in cavalry is that I am using Gale Force 9 bases for this project, and I have to order (or buy at Fall In) the stands.  Curse me for not realizing this at Historicon, I could have easily picked them up then.The stands form different sized units in different games, but almost always a Battalion.  In \"Square Bashing\" a battalion is 4 stands.  In \"Barrage\", probably 5 stands.  In a mod of \"Chassepot and Needlegun\", a battalion varies between 4 and 6 stands.With 3-4 battalions to a regiment in Manchuria (for both sides), and 2-3 regiments to a division, this means that I should be able to do maybe two infantry divisions (48 stands) per side, with additional cavalry and divisional asset artillery.  That is MUCH too big for Barrage, and even for Square Bashing.  But it is the right size for C&N, if I want each player on a side to control a division.Ideally a C&N game would be 3 on 2 (with 3 russian players, and 2 japanese players) each controlling a division.  The Japanese troops would almost universally have better morale, and the Russians would outnumber them in a field battle.  In an Attack-Defense game, with the Japanese on the attack (as the many scenarios taking the fortifications around Port Arthur would call for), the Russians might fare as well as 1-1, but the Japanese would have much better troops and better machine guns.I am still a few weeks away from a critical mass of painted stands, but perhaps by Fall In the first clash of sabres and bayonets in Manchuria will hit the table.Japanese Painting Decisions: I am doing the Japanese half in the early Blue winter uniform, and half in the later Khaki uniform.  This is because of other uses I have in mind for the figures.  The Blue figures will do very nicely for the Sino-Japanese war (which I plan on using 15mm Boxer Rebellion chinese for), and also for the Boxer Rebellion.  The Khaki figures will do very nicely (with one eye closed) for some RCW interventionist forces.Russian Painting Decisions: I will be doing some of the units in the white gymnasterka top, with the Russian green trousers that the legation troops wore in Peking and on Seymour's column in the Boxer Rebellion.  The remainder of the troops will be getting an all-green (1881 uniform) treatment.  I am prepping two units of Frontier Guards.  I would like to find fur-cap russians in the 1881 uniform that I could use as Siberian Guards.  A few of these troops may see double duty in the RCW, not too many.  The cossacks, on the other hand, will be usable up until WWII.Some Russo-Japanese Links:Wikipedia EntryRusso-Japanese War Research SocietyRusso-Japanese War Armed Conflict Event DataGood overall article on the Zhukov Russian Military History SiteEncyclopedia Britannica article with good linksOsprey book on the ConflictSome Sino-Japanese War Links:Wikipedia ArticleExcellent article from the Russo-Japanese Research SocietyExcellent Excerpt from Sara Paine's BookConcise Overview of the ConflictTags: miniatures, military history, Russo-Japanese War"},

Through the Desert (with four players) - one of my favorites - most of the players were noobs, or had only played once a long time ago.  I think this one works better with three, but that's just me. Ticket to Ride Europe (three players) - always a good game. TransAmerica (three players) - Carol took a nose-dive in this one.  Fun, but spectacular disaster for Carol. Colosseum (four players) - Alan and Sharon got there just a little too late for him to join in on Colosseum, but next time I think he would like it.  We enjoyed it (I won - breaking Jon's winning streak).  Cool game. Carcassonne Hunters and Gatherers (five players) - Not enough Fishing Huts at the end, but it looked like it was pretty close.

{"title": "Runequest - it should be much cooler than it seems", "date": "Friday, June 27, 2008", "text": "Runequest and the world that grew up along with it (and boardgames such as Dragon Pass and Red Moon/White Bear), known as Glorantha, is home to some amazing mythology and wonderful fantasy creatures.There are ducks, gorps, broo, jack-o-bears, walktapi and loads of others.And while I really liked good old 2nd edition Runequest (from Chaosium), it always seemed to be much more popular in England than the USA.  Then when Avalon Hill published their version, they sort of emasculated Glorantha, and also mucked with a simple magic system (battle magic and rune magic) by adding sorcery.  For some reason they also renamed Battle Magic to Spirit Magic.  Not sure why.  The addition of sorcery, of course, wasn't just a rule change, it also changed the fabric of the runequest world.  The older system (where the world, Glorantha, was an integral part of the rules) had a real reason for there to be the two main types of magic - battle magic was something that everyone could learn.  Small, quick spells that you cast, and they would dwindle quickly.  The more potent rune magic spells were part of the mythology of the world (love it, or hate it), and so had a reason to be in the game.Then along comes sorcery - a new, and potent magic, that doesn't really fit in the game.  BUT it did give a new type of scholarly type magic that fit most medieval European style RPG worlds.  And Avalon Hill was targeting (at least in the basic release) a sort of mythic Europe setting for their version of the game.  Eventually, due to fan demand, and the ability to sense a buck to be made, Avalon Hill produced much of the Glorantha material (and a lot of it was in a very good format).  But the game was changed forever.The faithful have since released Glorantha in a couple of (admittedly) very weak looking systems for roleplaying heroquests and epic mythic adventures.  Maybe it appeals to some, but not to me and my group.  Good news however, there does seem to be an adherence to things old with the Mongoose Publishing version.EDIT - The Mongoose version seems to be a pseudo d20 version.  Sad.  However, in June of 2008, Chaosium released a version of Basic Role Playing.  This is not the old 1980 version of BRP (which was a stripped down version of their d100 rules, sort of Runequest without the Runequest parts), but is actually a reprint of the four books that made up the Avalon Hill production, but with the name \"Runequest\" removed throughout, and with the name \"Basic Role Play\" inserted instead.  So, if sorcery is to be included, and battle magic is spirit magic, then it seems like this is the best version currently in print.Tags: runequest"},

The group recovered the lost Kreftring, the heirloom of the Raker Mountain Dwarves of Ratik that the group had agreed to help.Well, old Viney, due to some romantic entanglements that he got involved in when last in Keoland, decided that he actually liked the world much better back in Ratik, so he volunteered to return the Ring as quickly as possible (the adventurers have been underground, now, for several days).  He took along with him the women the group rescued from the Goblins (serving as harem slaves).Hopefully Viney will not be too late in returning the ring, and high priest Starmetal and the King will be fortified in their positions, and the wicked nephew of the king (and his advisor, from the Great Kingdom) will be recognized for what they are - opportunistic greedy materialists.Is this the end of Viney Badeloch?

And which company produces that games that we enjoy so much?For high ranking games at home, I would guess Ticket to Ride, Settlers, or any of the Carcassonne variants.  For companies, I would guess its Rio Grande, or for original publishers, maybe Days of Wonder or Fantasy Flight.  Probably Days of Wonder, come to think of it.At one time it would have been (for me) Avalon Hill, and then Mayfair.

We played a couple of times, for maybe an hour or so each occasion.The game is quite fun, with fun characters and levels, and the action is quite visceral.  You get to demolish blocks in a number of great ways that remind me of the wooden block forts I used to build as a child.  Me and a foe would each build a block fort on the floor of opposite ends of the living room or the front porch.  Then we would populate those forts with green plastic army men.  Then the war would commence.  We would alternate throwing blocks at each others forts, trying to demolish as much as possible, and wipe out plastic army men.

{"title": "Castles and Crusades Campaign Continues", "date": "Friday, May 30, 2008", "text": "We will all mourn for the passing of a great and noble warrior.  Nords the Dwarf has passed to stone, in the fashion of the Dwarf people.  He was slain while fighting Great Goblins in the Grotto of the Ice Hunter Goblins - hot on the trail of the goblin chieftain that the heroes are pursuing to retrieve the Kreftring.  In the bottom of the multi-layered Grotto (a mountain dungeon system built in the Southern tailbone of the Rakers, at the edge of a glacier) is a gateway that leads to mysterious dungeons beneath the Fortress of the Shadow Rose (a castle in Keoland! halfway around the world, but it is where the Goblin chieftain is hiding out).The players were sorely tested, even though Viney Badeloch took a co-role in performing \"rogue\" abilities with Clematis, the halfling.The evening of adventure started out pretty good.  The party had been holed up in a room where they had slain some ogres and giant spiders.  The group was in uncharted territory, so they had bolted shut the doors and spiked them closed.  Then they took turns watching while all got some rest (about 8 hours) and while Annalise (the female cleric of Ehlonna) got enough rest to concentrate and meditate on getting her spells back.  Finally they were rested up and proceeded out from their room into the wider dungeon.  The group faced down a number of undead (ghouls, zombies, and skeletons) until coming to a room tha was heavily guarded by Great Goblins and Ice Hunter cats.  A fight broke out and the heroes were victorious.  Along the way, however, Nords passed along.  He was facing down two great goblins, having interposed his body in front of Annalise so that she could pull back from the front line of fighting.  The maneuver was successful, but it left Nords (exposed in the room) facing off against two Great Goblins and being shot at by a couple of Goblin archers.The two Great Goblins were too much.  Especially when one got a critical hit.  Nords was down to 4hp left, and he didn't bother to tell ANYONE (how infuriating - he might still be alive if he had but asked Annalise for a single healing spell.  But he did not.  One of the great goblins (as mentioned) got a Critical hit, and Nords took an additional 24 points of damage (which made him go approx 20 points negative, certainly dead and not coming back).Tags: Castles & Crusades100 Must Read Books The Essential Mans LibraryThis is a great start for ANYONE building up a library of good (GOOD) books.

{"title": "Week of Trolls - Day Seven - Hunting Trolls", "date": "Monday, May 26, 2008", "text": "The chief occupation of adventurers in FRPG, when it comes to the realm of adventurer-troll relations, is that of population control.  Adventurers kill trolls.  Or they die trying.  This final installment in the week of trolls (which is being posted a long weekend too late, but hey - its my blog), is concerned with a few topics related to killing trolls.First, the topic of killing trolls begins with the meat and potatoes of adventurer combat skills - the weapon.  A long out of print (but locally written, produced, and printed) game that bore more than a passing resemblance to Runequest 2nd Ed., called \"Element Masters\", once featured a weapon in it called the Trollkiller.  It was a hefty two handed weapon (that had a steep strength minimum in order to wield it) that did 3d6 damage.  In Runequest, especially when using hit-locations, that was enough to nearly guarantee if not the death of the standard troll, then at least a severing of a limb or head.  Sever a head and it lives?  Well, it depends on the troll, its cult, its runes, spells, etc - it gets complicated quick.In AD&D, especially when weapons did different damage against large creatures (which Trolls classify as), the two handed sword is a great choice.  It is slow - bummer - but it does hefty damage.  Now, the classic AD&D troll has 6+6HD - which is to say 6d8 + 6 points, or (on average) 33 hit points.  Up to a maximum of 54 hit points.  Now, take your average fighter.  He might have a magic sword of say, +2, and he might have a str bonus of say, +2/+4, which means that with a two handed sword (which does 3d6 vs. large), he is going to dish out, on average, 17 points of damage, and depending on which rules you use, he might get 2 attacks a round.  IF he is lucky, and if the troll doesn't finish him off first (not a bad chance, considering he does a maximum potential damage of 28 points of damage per round), then the Fighter might finish off a troll in 2 rounds, 1 round if he is very lucky.  Ahh, but trolls regenerate, you say, and they come back, and all of the other devious things that trolls can do as posted in the first part of the week of trolls.  And, of course, they travel in packs sometimes.Which brings up an interesting point - teamwork against a pack of trolls.  Do you concentrate on one?  Or pair off against individual trolls?  Well, every dungeon is different, and every combat unique, but I would suggest concentrating on one troll at a time, and then if the resources are available, have the weakest member of the adventuring party make sure that the remains do just that - remain, and not reform into regenerated trolls.Point two - weapons that do real damage to the troll.  Everything discussed above, with the typical fifth level fighter, and his typical +2 magic two-handed sword is all well and good, but that damage to a troll is just a tickle.  A walk in the park.  A minor obstruction.  He regenerates, you see, and Mr. Troll does not like to wait around.  He'll start reforming the instant he is dead, and just a few short rounds later, he is up and at it again, kicking in all he's got for the Troll regiment.  So how do you dish out damage that really matters - damage that will keep Uncle Ugly down permanently?  Well, it boils down (basically) to either fire or acid.  Adventurers dealing with trolls should ignore everything about infravision and ultravision and dark vision and twilight vision, and this vision and that vision.  Carry torches.  Every member of the party should be armed with a fist full of fire.  The more the merrier.  It might ward off trolls, or if they are desperate or stupid enough to attack, then it provides the means for permanent damage.  And if a troll is downed, then a party member can use a torch to begin scorching the troll remains.  Other options, if available, are fire based spells and firebrand (or flaming) magic weapons.  As summoned fire elemental does nicely, but if you can pull off that trick, it seems a waste to use against some trolls.  Which brings us to point three...Acid.  Ah, it seems so useful.  Just \"immerse the body parts in acid\" the first edition monster manual states.  Think of this - a large, gangly, rubbery humanoid freak with a height over 8 feet tall - how big are those body parts going to be?  How much acid do you need?  That little flask the adventurer carries in his belt to use as a desperate hand grenade isn't going to do it.  A couple of jugs of the stuff.  Or maybe a pool of acid (found in the better dungeons) should do the trick.  One final option comes from the world of Cidri (revealed in the published materials from Metagaming related to \"The Fantasy Trip\").Universal Solvent.  What a great idea!  Some made alchemist devises a material that can dissolve anything.  ANYTHING.  Nearly instantly.  And he renders it into liquid form (what do you keep it in?).  Luckily the forward thinking alchemist was wise beyond his years, and he made it a two part compound.  You can carry those parts quite safely, but combine them - and you have local meltdown happening.  Now, to me, this should do the job quite nicely on Mr. Troll.  And the Mrs., and all the children.  But it is dangerous.  And what happens when you use Universal Solvent on the pile of troll parts, to dissolve a nice breadbox sized hole right down through the pile, and it continues on through the floor, down 15 feet through the bedrock, and down into the chamber with the angry green dragon in it a level down?  Doesn't matter, those troll parts won't be regenerating though....Tags: trolls"},

After all, most of the humanoid races have their shamans, priests, and wizards.

Not only can they regenerate, but they also appear to occur \"naturally\" in a number of different forms and environments.It was mentioned early on in the week that Trolls are rather susceptible to changes brought on by environment or magic.  To that end, we will explore some of the many different changes that can be granted to trolls, either accidentally or on purpose, due to exposure to random or chaotic fields of magic.Some of these effects might come about due to gifts from chaotic or insane wizards or magical beings, and others might just occur due to eating the wrong magical fungus or living in close proximity to a magical device or portal.The initial list is of twelve items, and no doubt this will grow or perhaps will be sub-compartmentalized.Iron SkinTough metallic skin gives the troll AC20, and a move of only 20 ft.Fire BreathThe troll can breathe fire for 4d6, 10 ft. range, victim may save vs. Dexterity to avoid.Acid Vomit2d6 first round, 1d6 each of second round and third round (4d6 total).  Range of 10 ft., victim save vs. Constitution for half damage.  Those adjacent to the victim get half effect (1d6/1d3/1d3), save vs. Constitution for half.Extra Armstwo additional arms grant two extra claw attacks, or one additional weapon attack.Strength GlyphExtreme strength grants the troll an addition +2 to hit and +2 damage.Speed RuneAffected permanently as per the Haste spell (double all physical attacks, or 1 additional weapon attack, and move at double speed).Forge FireTroll affects all metal items as if a heat metal spell were cast on him.  If the troll uses a metal weapon, it will do an additional 2d4 of heat damage.InvisibilityTroll is capable of becoming invisible 3x per day.  If the troll attacks, then it is immediately visible again.Hive SkullTroll's head is rotten on the inside and is a permanent home to a swarm of insects.  Affects as per the spell Insect Plague, but with a 20 ft. diameter (centered on the troll).Electric HideEach blow on the troll causes a 1d6 lightning bolt to arc between the troll and anything within 10 ft.  Save vs. Constitution for half damage.WingedThe troll has huge bat wings that eneable it to fly at 30 ft. per round.ParthenogenicIf this troll falls, the act of reforming will actually grow two complete new trolls.  In addition, each point of damage that the troll regenerates contributes to a new troll forming on the back of the original.  For every 20 points of damage that regenerates, a new troll with 20 hit points separates from the back of the original, and it will then continue to regenerate until it reaches full strength (the full hit points of the original).  Note that it two will spawn new trolls.  (This might lead to some interesting book-keeping for the Castle Keeper.)Roll 1d12 to determine such gifts, or in response to a \"Bestow Troll with Special Ability\" spell (see Week of Trolls - Day Six - Troll Magic for more details).Troll Special AbilitiesIron SkinFire BreathAcid VomitExtra ArmsStrength GlyphSpeed RuneForge FireInvisibilityHive SkullElectric HideWingedParthenogenicTags: trolls"},

The Flying Wyrm is amazingly resistant to most magic (hence its SR8 rating).Combat: The Flying Wyrm will attempt to use its claws and bite if facing a foe on the ground, or if mounted by a Cloud Troll.  If fighting on its own, or fro the air, then it will attempt to use its tail sting, which is poisonous.Poison: The tail sting of the Flying Wyrm requires the victim to make a constitution save, failure means that the victim takes 2d4 damage in the first round, and an additional 1d4 damage for the next two rounds, and the victim is paralyzed for 3d4 rounds.  If the save is successful, all damage is halved, and no paralysis occurs.The Troll Spider is a variation of a giant spider that was created by dark elf sorcerers via magical means. They have an unusual affinity for both Triders and also Trolls.Troll SpiderNO. ENCOUNTERED: 1-12SIZE: MediumHD: 4(d8)MOVE: 30 ft., 20 ft.

Troll Spiders seem to have a rudimentary understanding of commands issued from these creatures, as well as from Dark Elves.Poison: The Troll Spider, upon biting, injects a poison that requires the victim to make a constitution save.  If the save is a success, no further effects occur.  If the save is a failure, then the victim takes an immediate 1d6 damage, and must make a second save the next round.  If the second save is a failure, then the victim takes an additional 1d6 damage, and is paralyzed for 1d4 hours.  Success in the second round means no additional damage.  Some troll spiders (50%) can spit their poison up to 30 feet.Web: The Troll Spider can create a web, as per the web spell, up to 8x per day.Regeneration: The Troll Spider can regenerate as per a troll, at the rate of 2HP per round.  If the Troll Spider falls, it will reform in 3d6 rounds.  The Troll Spider's unique physiology mean that it is immune to acid attacks, and can only be kept from regenerating or reforming by flame attacks or burning the bodily remains.Day Five is coming.  I believe that the Week of Trolls is going amazingly well.  This is so much fun, I may do something similar in the future for another one of my favorite monsters - the Bugbear.Tags: trolls"},

We played two games, she beat me both times, but it was close.  The first time, she got a shrine-to-shrine victory.

The Cloud Troll, and the Trider.The Cloud Troll is a creature specially bred by magical means by Ogre Magi serving Vaprak.  They were intended, originally, to wage ware against the holdings of Cloud Giants, and have several abilities that mimic a cloud giant.  It is reported that Cloud Trolls have a natural affinity for a special breed of giant wyverns (known simply as flying wyrms), and have been known to use them as mounts.  Cloud Trolls use weapons and armor, and so are definitely among the more advanced subspecies (see the article on Trolls and Technology).Cloud TrollNO. ENCOUNTERED: 1, 2-7SIZE: LargeHD: 9(d8)MOVE: 40 ft.AC: 17ATTACKS: Bite (2d6), Weapon (+4 str dam)SPECIAL: Fog, Mist, Levitate, Dark Vision 60 ft., RegenerationSAVES: PINT: Ave.ALIGNMENT: Chaotic EvilTYPE: GiantTREASURE: 7XP:The Cloud Troll is encountered singularly if by random encounter or in a dungeon or wilderness setting.  If encountered in a cloud realm, then there will be a group of 2-7 (1d6+1) on a mission against a particular cloud giant.  In such a case, one of the cloud trolls will be a leader, with 11hd(d8) and spell caster ability as a level 4 cleric.  In all cases, the cloud giant is almost always (75%) accompanied by his flying wyrm.Combat: The Cloud Troll will prefer to fight with weapons, if available.  He will employ either a great sword and shield (the great sword does 2d8dam +4 for STR; speed factor 8), and the shield will add +2 to the AC of the Cloud Troll.  In certain circumstances, a great club will be substituted, but it is a two handed weapon (3d6 dam +4 for STR; speed factor 10).Fog: The Cloud Troll can create a fog cloud as a 9th level Wizard casting the 2nd level Wizard spell.  Usable 1x per day.Mist: The Cloud Troll can create an obscuring mist as a 9th level Druid casting the 1st level Druid spell.  Usable 3x per day.Levitate: The Cloud Troll can levitate as a 9th level Wizard casting the 2nd level Wizard spell.  Usable 3x per day.Regeneration: The Cloud Troll regenerates as does his earthly cousins.  2HP regenerated per round.  Damage suffered from fire or acid cannot be regenerated.  The Cloud Troll that falls in combat, will reform 3d6 rounds later.The Trider, on the other hand, is the results of an effort at deliberate cross-breeding (with the assistance of dark magic, etc).  It seems that a renegade enclave of Drow Elves, tired of being on the losing end of things with aggressive neighbors.  So, in the meantime, it seemed like it was a good idea to pump things up.  This was done by taking the magical constructs known as Driders (part giant spider, part male drow elf), and cross-mixing it with the brutish Troll.  The result is a large, barbaric, troll-spider hybrid, that has a number of unusual abilities of regeneration, and phasing through stone structures.TriderNO. ENCOUNTERED: 1, 1-4SIZE: LargeHD: 8(d8)MOVE: 30 ft., 15ft.

It appears as the upper torso of a troll (green, lanky, rubbery skin, etc.) attached to the body of a very big spider.  The creature was originally created by renegade dark elves to counter driders, but some have escaped and now live on their own.  They may be encountered singly or in small hunting groups.  They will sometimes be accompanied by (50%) troll spiders (1d3 per trider), (30%) trolls (1-4) or (10%) dark elves (2-12 per trider).Combat: The Trider will sometimes (50%) fight with weapons (favoring a great trident, 2d8dam +4 from STR; speed factor 10), or with his claws.  Both bite and claw can deliver poison (see below).  Triders fighting with weapons will usually wear bits of armor as well, giving a +2 to AC.Web: The Trider is able to create a web as per the Web spell, 3x per day.Poison: Whenever a successful Trider bite or claw attack is made, the victim must make a constitution save.  If the save is successful, the victim is temporarily paralyzed for 1-2 rounds.  If the save is failed, then the victim is paralyzed for 4d6 rounds, and takes 2d6 damage.Regeneration: The Trider regenerates in a manner similar to Trolls.  The Trider regenerates 4HP per round.  If the Trider is slain, but not by flame or acid, then it reforms in 3d6 rounds.Note that the statistics on both the Flying Wyrm and the Troll Spider appear in a supplemental posting.Tags: trolls"},

This evening was a pleasant evening spent in Central America.  We had taco salad for supper.  Then following, we (Anita, Heidi, and I) played a game of Mexica.  The game is, briefly, about the building of the city of Tenochtitlan Mexico, on the island of Lake Texcoco.The game is the second in the Kramer trilogy of Tikal, Mexica, and Java.  We have (and enjoy) the first two.  This was Heidi's second game, ever, and she was doing pretty well.  It was Anita's first game of Mexica in a long, long time but she was doing quite well when we quit.  We only played the first half of a two part game (it was a school night, and Heidi had some homework).  Maybe we'll get to it again, soon.When putting the game away for the evening, Anita and I remarked about some other Kramer games that we have (and enjoy).  These included El Grande (wonderful!) and Torres (also wonderful!).In all, the exercise of constructing a 14th century Aztec city on a swampy island in a brackish Mexico lake was quite enjoyable.  I think I had the bloodiest sacrifices to take place in my callpulis.  In the end it was a nice break from Trolls.  For now.Tags: mexica, tenochtitlan, aztec"},
{"title": "Week of Trolls - Day Three - Technology", "date": "Sunday, May 18, 2008", "text": "It turns out that there is a quite a wide dichotomy concerning the conceptualization of trolls and Technology.Evidently, many depictions of Trolls in the source material depict them as naked (or near-naked) savages that exist primitively, eating what they can catch, living where they can climb up into a safe hole, and communicating only rudimentarily, until some weaker but more intelligent or advanced of an ally race comes along to recruit the troll.  But trolls have the intelligence to use tools, armor, weapons, etc, and often collaborate with beings for whom these artifacts are commonplace.  In fact, it is this depiction, or aspect, of the troll that todays entry is based on.  Trolls and technology - whether it is purpose built arms and armor for the troll, or just the ability of trolls to pick up anything and use it, or some special magic items designed to augment the natural abilities of Monsieur Troll.The troll usually seems quite capable on his own, thank you very much.  And most of the source material is quite clear on whether they are depicting the troll as the nearly-naked savage (handsomely decked out only in loin cloth; relying on his wits(!), claws, and fangs for survival), or the more sophisticated beast, nearly civilized, wearing clothing and bearing arms.  The troll description for Castles and Crusades, for instance, differentiates between the clothing wearing (very similar to the trolls in the Hobbit) fellows known as Hill Trolls, and the more usual (at least as far as D&D based trolls are concerned) naked fiend known as the River Troll.  There is some basic combat difference (different hit dice) between the two, as well.Angus McBride (rest his soul) depicted for MeRP's Cardolan supplement an absolutely wonderful image of an armored war troll.  This is a good example of a simplistic, not-too-intelligent looking troll being shown with armor.  He is still, however, carrying a basic spiked club as a weapon.  This may be of choice (the great club is the favored weapon of Vaprak the Destroyer), or it may be because some armor has been scrounged, but not weapons suited to those huge hammy fists have been found...In terms of physical attacks, the claw/claw/bite of the basic troll (an additional capability exists for the primitive river trolls of C&C - if the claws strike, then a special \"rend\" attack, for additional claw damage, is possible - nice) is pretty well off.  Adding weapons, however, in a universe where magic is routinely captured into objects, is an added bonus.   A troll with a sword of wounding for instance, would be a right nasty beast.  How about a flaming battleaxe?  Or a great morningstar that when it does a critical hit delivers a piercing critical as well as a blunt critical?  Recall that the troll is a large creature, and as such its physical attacks have a speed factor of +6 (in 2nd edition AD&D style initiative systems). In light of this, how about a simple pair of spiked cesti of speed (speed factor 2, do 1d4+1+str, or 1d4+5 for our friend, Sir Troll).  The truly ingenious dungeon keeper would hire some unscrupulous dark alfar mage to craft enchanted fang-tips for his trolls.  Now that would be something to spring on the most jaded of players.  \"You suddenly find yourselves fighting a trio of particularly vile looking trolls, wearing bits of blood-encrusted chain armor, and with a magic dweomer emanating from the golden caps on their fangs...\"  My friends, now that is an encounter.Additionally, armor is a big consideration as well for trolls.  Nothing will make that regeneration count for more than having the armor class of the troll be raised from 16 to about 19.  Sweet music to my ears.  Again, other than just enhancing the (already formidable) combat statistics of our dear species, armor introduces the capacity for new abilities.  What about a chain shirt that adds +2 to the AC, but also silences the troll and all around him for approx 5 feet.  Not only would that enable the most diabolical of sneak attacks, but it would also have completely maddened the troll to the point of performing the most hideous atrocities.  How about an enchanted breastplate (+3AC) that places a permanent blink effect on the troll?  Nasty.  How about a padded hauberk made of Nilbog hide?  Look it up if it doesn't ring a bell.  Here is one that I like- I came up with this a number of years back, and put it into a dungeon I designed.  The players never came up against it, but ooooh, I really was hoping...Blackiron Trollhelm - A magical helm, sized to fit large humanoids, adds +2AC for head attacks and defends against head criticals.  Whenever the wearer is close (engaged in combat) with a foe, the helm transfers either one point of intelligence or one point of wisdom per round from the foe to the wearer of the helm.  If the wearer of the helm is killed before the helm is removed, the loss of int and wis is permanent.  Otherwise, the stats return at the rate of one point per hour (if either the wearer escapes alive, or if the helm is removed).  Note that lost spell and skill slots in case of permanent int or wis lowering will be in effect until the stats are restored.As debilitating as it would be for the player character to lose a couple of points of int or wis (or a combo), imagine the damage a troll with an int of 11 could do?Finally there are items that are created to either augment troll natural abilities or to add additional ones, other than in the areas of arms or armor.  A terrific example would be a magic item augmenting regeneration.  Consider the Amulet of Vaprak - this magic amulet, if worn by a troll, adds to the troll's regeneration any additional points of damage that the troll scores against a human or demi-human foe by biting.I suspect that I would not honor the memory of many players in previous campaigns if I did not bring up the case of Trolls In Technology.  By this, I mean, magic items that I have devised over the years that feature trolls.  One of my all time favorites are troll coins.Troll Coins - these are slightly large, distinctive (in some way - perhaps design or thickness) gold coins that are found as part of a regular treasure.  If these coins get completely wet for whatever reason (likely in a dungeon), then 3 rounds later they disappear and summon a troll that immediately attacks the bearer.  Having a small sack of a half dozen such coins is a wonderful thing to do, especially when there is a dwarven thief in the group.Tags: trolls"},
{"title": "Week of Trolls - Day Two - Tactics", "date": "Sunday, May 18, 2008", "text": "Although there is some interesting cultural information concerning trolls from other worlds (such as Glorantha, or Discworld), the basic orientation I will take is of a standard D&D type world, for a game from that family or RPGs (D&D, AD&D, D20, C&C, HackMaster, OSRIC, etc).  Readers of Gaming with Chuck will no doubt realize that I prefer gaming in the World of Greyhawk primarily, but the Forgotten Realms secondarily, if for not other reason that that these settings are designed to support FRPG situations, and also because of their familiarity.  I actually prefer to do a bit of world design on my own, but even published worlds leave a lot to be developed, so I can strike a happy medium as a DM by using a published world (Greyhawk, Harn, Forgotten Realms, etc), and then developing a lot of filler for the world on my own.  My ideas, presented here, on the tactics of trolls fill this area.Tactics of trolls.  Trolls are amazing beings.  Ignore the regeneration bit, that was covered in Week One.  Other than that, Trolls are natural climbers of the most astonishing ability (I believe that they have, according to an early write up, an 80% chance to scale sheer walls, and even higher for craggy surfaces).  They can exist for extremely long periods with very little material resource.  They are vicious, unrelenting, and nearly fearless in combat.  They can adapt to and apparently mutate to accommodate nearly any sort of environ that they can be encountered in.  Trolls have the animalistic cunning and enough intelligence to craft the most devilish of ambushes and trap-situations.Tactically speaking, a creature with these attributes is incredible.  A group of trolls could set up some sort of bait, with a nearby ring of ambush trolls hiding in some environ-appropriate concealing terrain.  This might involve trolls hiding down a well, clinging to a ceiling, hiding under or inside furniture or wagons.  Trolls can attack from having spent time (l-o-n-g time, if necessary) inside furniture, from a pool of quicksand, from underwater, or clinging to some overhead, out of the way, out of site hiding spot.  Given their cunning ability to set traps and ambush victims, this might lead to some sort of distraction or bait being used to ferret out a party of adventurers.  Perhaps a lesser allied group of warriors (goblins, orcs, etc).  this will create a loud ruckus, usually, and this is what the troll is counting on.  The noise will alert the nearby trolls, who in a near torpor-like state, have been lying in wait in the most unlikely of places.  Lets take a typical dungeon scene.  An open (30' by 50') balcony area, overlooking a cliff down to a great underground river.  The river is occasionally traffic'd by drow trading barges, but they are far below, and out of mind for the typical adventurer.  Guarding some heaps of treasure on the balcony are a group of orc warriors (a dozen level 3 warriors, lead by a single level 5 chieftain).  These orcs are bribed to stay here by the local trolls, who reward the orcs with baubles taken from the drow barges below (which are also ambushed by the trolls, from underwater).  The trolls know that the orcs are not strong enough to keep the loot, and that adventurers or even other subterranean races will be attracted to the loot, fight the orcs, make a large noise, attract the trolls, and become lunch.  I suppose that anything in the human or demi-human culinary tradition must taste better to a troll than orcs, goblins, gnolls, or any of the other lesser humanoid races they ally with.In our example scenario, the orcs are found out by adventurers, attacked on the balcony, fought to near extinction, and create a large ruckus in the process.  Now, a group of trolls in ambush attack.  Some scurry up the impossibly high cliffs, creep over the balcony guard-wall, and attack.  Some drop from the stalactite encrusted ceiling above the balcony, and some leap up out of the pit of offal that the orc guards have created in the process of living here for some time.  This is a half dozen trolls, dropped in among the ranks of adventurers, spreading out and attacking all of them.  By the third round, if the adventurers have not been able to recover and concentrate their attacks, the trolls will (as a group) begin regenerating 18 hit points per round (3 per troll).  This is more than usually a couple of adventurers will average per round, so that the trolls will last for some time and should take at least one or more adventurers with them.This brings up another tactical consideration of trolls.  Trolls in the natural have three attacks (with approximately something around +6 or more per attack).  These attacks are 2 claws (d4+4 damage each), and a shredding bite (d8+4 damage).  Even if the troll turns in one of the claws for a weapon (perhaps a d8 sword, turning the d4+4 to sword damage +4, along with whatever magical bonus the sword may have - in our example above, imagine a troll with a drow blade), it still has another claw attack and a bite attack.  If it turns in both claw attacks for a two handed weapon attack (perhaps mimicing the great spiked club of Vaprak, the deity of Trolls and Ogres), it might have a single attack of 2d10+4 damage.  But it still retains the bite.  What this means is multiple attacks.  Multiple chances for a critical hit.  If the troll has filth induced poison or special damage, then multiple chances to confer this to the target player.I prefer to think of the rarest of instances where a troll gets three critical hits in one round (claw/claw/bite) as a troll trifecta.  That will certainly make even a mid-level fighter step back a round or two and cry for help from the cleric.  Speaking of which, if you aren't using the critical hits from Arms Law/Claw Law, but rather something more conventional like the Good Hits/Bad Misses system from dragon magazine, perhaps it is useful to think of the claws as slashing attacks, and the bite as a piercing attack.  It makes the critical hits from Monsieur Troll that much more interesting.Additional Tactical concerns for a troll encounter would be either the trolls reliance on some sort of magical or shamanistic aid (perhaps from a troll shaman or cleric of Vaprak, or perhaps from some magical baubles that the troll has acquired from previous raids or ambushes).  The troll certainly requires little in the way of healing (perhaps a charm or rune to enhance the regeneration?), already has a decent enough attack factor, does decent damage, is quite mobile in most physical locales, and is nearly fearless.  The only area where magic seems needed would be in rendering some additional elements to the attack types - maybe adding a flaming or acidic or electrical component to the troll's claw attacks?  Perhaps making the bite poisonous?  Maybe even injecting some parasite creature that leaches off the life force of the victim?  All good.  All useful.The troll uses its innate abilities (hide, climb, exist in a secure place near infinitely) to perform a debilitating ambush.  As a group, there are multiple attacks, from the trolls, coming to multiple targets in the groups.  There is a chance for critical with every attack (which do considerable damage).  Even if the trolls are defeated, this is a strong foe for the DM to use.  Even with very little outside influence this becomes a challenging encounter.  Add an interesting setting, some compelling plot elements, perhaps a meta-encounter, and something that will engage the players, threaten the characters, and amuse the DM ensues.Thank you, Mr. Troll, for providing such a good time.Tags: trolls"},
{"title": "Week of Trolls - Day One - Regeneration", "date": "Friday, May 16, 2008", "text": "The biological process of Regeneration is a wonderful thing that never ceases to amaze me. Why some creatures and not others?   Surely this would be a wonderful trait in just about any prey creature, no?  Sacrifice a limb to your predator, and away you go.  Mostly, just like new, back to normal.  Sometimes, not.And then there is the troll.  A creature who lives for combat and violence [Sidebar: I especially like the history of the Uz, or trolls, in the Runequest world.  While they do not regenerate, as a rule, they are creatures who have come to embrace a sort of racial anger and hatred of all others - especially surface races such as men and elves.  The anger comes from repeated cursing from the gods, which has left the Uz race to not breed true, to bear mutated children, and to remain stunted and stupid as a species.  Certainly, these are all reasons to embrace violence.  And professional wrestling.] and who inhabits forgotten locales of the world (above and below the surface) that are prone to accumulate wonders and treasures, will not doubt sooner or later have a run in with well armed adventurers of all sorts.  These leads to what would otherwise be a nice meal, rather to an exercise in getting one's own limbs chopped off.  Repeatedly.  Over time, you could see how regeneration would be a useful survival trait here.Most trolls (of the D&D and related family of games) have a standard sort of trollish regeneration that is something like 3 hit points per round, starting with the third round after damage is accumulated.  Some of the subspecies of troll actually have higher rates of regeneration - how about 6 points per round, beginning with the fourth round.  Or how about 10 points per round for a Fire Troll, whenever it is immersed in lava or magma.  I'll take two of those, wrapped for travel, please.If you remove a body part of a troll (easy to do with a Sword of Sharpness, a Vorpal Weapon, or certain Lawn Implements), it will eventually begin regenerating on its own.  Several versions of several games have had different points of view on this, but I like the fact that every arm and leg will grow into a new troll, or find a way to rejoin it's sibling limbs.Does being regenerative lead the troll to be more fearless?  Sure having your hand burnt or slashed or chewed off hurts, but you can always grow a new piece.  This leads me to an interesting point.  Using a firebrand or acidic blade to fight a troll is all well and good, but it does not keep the parts from regenerating.  Sure it might slow the process down, but unless you completely destroy the inanimate parts with fire or acid, then the scorched or burnt parts will eventually rot off, and the clean tissue underneath will begin regenerating again.  It is a beautiful machine, the troll.As dungeon denizens, I can think of none better.  They have a (admittedly rudimentary) intelligence - enough to be given items to occasionally use (armor, weapons), they can be crossbred with any number of other species (giants, ogres, goblinoids, man, etc) for interesting results, and is terribly receptive to magical mutation.  Perhaps all of these traits trace back to the regeneration ability?  The implications are certainly there.  And how do you starve a troll?  They will eat anything.  Anything.  In times of desperation or hunger, presumably this means torn and shredded parts of themselves.  And after eons of living in some stony vault deep beneath a mad wizard's tower, the troll might (having consumed his own limbs many hundreds of times over) occasionally cry out to dark forces of the night in desperation or madness.  More on that later...In practical terms, I prefer to just keep a running total of the damage on the troll, where I add in the damage done each round by the players, then subtract the regeneration bit.  If a troll were allied to somewhat smarter beings, they might employ it somehow where it could bottleneck a trapped foe, such that only one or two of the trapped party might attack the troll, giving its regeneration a sustained chance at keeping the troll alive long enough to harass the party.One thing to point out is that the presence of the dreaded grey troll leads us to presume that not only Physical damage can be regenerated by the troll's amazing physique.  The grey troll is what results when a normal troll is subjected to the level drain (by undead, or other) and is drained to the point of death.  Later on, the whole body regenerates back the lost \"part\" - soul, spirit, lifespark, animus - yet is now not entirely sane nor of its own faculties.  The regenerated troll understands enough that it  realizes that it has died - at the hand of some supernatural being - and wants to gain vengeance since it (the troll) has now regenerated back to \"life\".Magic Item - Trollblood Mail - this is a magic armor made by a certain tribe of Duergar to aid in their ongoing battle against a large clan of trolls.  The mail shirt is a +2 hauberk of chainmail that magically sizes to fit any humanoid torso that attempts to wear it.  Once worn, the magic of the shirt begins to affect the wearer, however.  The wearer starts gaining a +1 to his constitution, once per week (cumulative).  With this bonus, the physiology of the wearer begins to approach that of a troll - faint greyish-green rubberiness of the skin, the thickening and darkening of the blood, etc.  Once the constitution reaches 21, the change is complete and the character has some outward trollish marks.  Also, a regenerative ability is gained, of 1 HP per 10 minutes - which is usually associated with a constitution of 25, but is conferred by the magic in the mail.  This item is usually only reserved for the most devout and dedicated of duergar fighters, as the effects are not reversible (nor is the shirt removable) without a wish.Tags: trolls, regenerationTROLLS!You know, the regenerating FRPG version, not the fairy tale \"live under the bridge and harass commuters\" version - are such a wonderful idea.  As far back as the 1974 version of \"Monsters and Treasures\" (volume 2 of the original D&D), trolls were an integral part of the monster hit list for fantasy roleplaying.Lets take a look, for a second, at the entry from \"Monsters and Treasures\" for this venerated beast - TROLLS: Thin and rubbery, loathsome Trolls are able to regenerate, so that beginning the third melee round after one is hit it will begin to repair itself.  Regeneration is at the rate of 3 hit points per turn.  Even totally sundered Trolls will regenerate eventually, so that unless they are burned or immersed in acid they will resume combat when they have regenerated to 6 or more hit points.  In strength they are about equal to an Ogre, but as they use only their talons and fangs for weapons, only one die of damage is scored when they hit an opponent.This early view gets some of the essentials right (in fact, it established them) - the trolls are thin and rubbery.  They are loathsome.  They fight with fangs and talons.  They regenerate.  Let me stress that last point - the troll regenerates.  I think that many gamers pass this over as merely a way to extend the combat effectiveness of the troll, and forget some of the fun aspects of adventuring and dungeoneering this could lead to.  But more on that later.  This view of trolls is somewhat unique - for it differs from trolls in Norse legend, and it certainly differs from the image of trolls in Tolkien.  Again, more on these topics later.One of the nice things about trolls, evidently, is that their basic makeup renders them very susceptible to magical alteration.  A source of strange energy is apparently all it takes to create a new subspecies of troll.  In fact, from the vast domain of official 2nd Edition AD&D monster pubs, we have the following types of trolls (other than the normal troll, which is similar to He described above): Desert Troll, Fire Troll, Freshwater Troll, Giant Troll, Gray Troll, Ice Troll, Legacy Troll, Phaze Troll, Saltwater Troll, Snow Troll, Spectral Troll, Stone Troll, and the Two-Haded Troll.  And this is not even getting into the multitude of Troll Types and Troll Variants espoused by v3.x of AD&D.  For the next week, I will do one troll posting a day, where I discuss attributes of the trolls, or some subvariant of troll.  Here on Gaming with Chuck, it is the \"Week of the Troll\".Tags: trolls"},

There was a little trouble in jumping across a 10 foot pit, but it got worked out.  Then there was the instance where a magical crown was found, and the group decided to not bother, once Gilmore started describing its history (\"created by a vengeful Efreet lord\", \"designed to kill mortals\", \"all will perish\", etc - the normal stuff).  This led to the intimidation and \"intensive questioning\" of a goblin guard - a process that derived some sense of direction to delve deeper into the dungeon.

Here are some links that might be of interest...Not so pretty reviewWorshipful reviewOverview of related products (with loads of links)Mad Irishman character sheetsMy own personal take on the whole thing is that the first and second editions were pretty good.  The third edition (with the ACT Table) had GREAT stuff - the writeups on mutations, organizations, and equipment were so very very cool - but the ACT was a total mudpie of a gaming mechanic that it was not playable as presented.  BTW - I feel the same way about Marvel Superheroes.  Totally unplayable (as if any superhero game other than Champions would get a thumbs up from me . . . well maybe DC heroes, but it was largely Champions derivative).  So, if you can get the books, run second edition rules, or perhaps even the modern Sword and Sorcery D20 rules, but use the great artwork, feel, and write ups from third edition.  Heck, even the maps and stuff in that version were really cool.

{"title": "Orcs - Recommended", "date": "Friday, May 2, 2008", "text": "The first two parts of this series: 1. Orcs - Considered 2. Orcs - DefendedMade the case that Orcs are not only popular and useful, but a good opponent for adventurers.I will go one step further and recommend that you use them in a game, very soon.First, there are a lot of orc resources available.  If you don't have the miniatures to use, then these paper figures are an excellent resource.  As are these, by the same artist.  If you would like to include allies for your orcs, then there are also goblin figures and kobold figures.Second, there are great online dungeon and treasure generators.  If you want excellent, free, maps of dungeons and castles - and any other encounter location - then you could do much worse than to check the online Map archive at the Wizards of the Coast website.Now, take your dungeon, with treasures.  Add some traps (difficulty to find and disarm appropriate to the level of the scenario, and also to the likelihood of a thief being with the players).  More if you like them.  A couple of magic fountains, and some interesting dungeon flora and fauna (fungus with magic effects; natural dungeon dwellers such as bats, giant ticks, stirges, or other party guests) should round out things nicely.  Help from AEG's Toolbox, or the (most excellent) 1st Ed. AD&D DM's Guide, or the new Engineering Dungeons title from Troll Lord games should all help.Once the basic environment is set, then you can add your orcs.  Lots of them.  In interesting and diabolical combinations.  Have a good half dozen or more per populated room (about 50-70% of the rooms should have some sort of challenge in it - either a monster, some orcs, or a puzzle/trap).  Make the Orcs have a level approximately 1-2 HD lower than the players.  If you need lesser creatures, then a subservient tribe of orcs, or lower caste orcs, or some of the lesser beings - such as goblins or kobolds can be used.When placing the orcs in the dungeon rooms, and setting up the architecture of the rooms, consider it a challenge.  The Orcs aren't stupid, and are quite martial minded, and they would set up all sorts of defensive mechanisms.  So you have a few trapped hallways?  The orcs should know the way around.  They can dig (in a fashion) and if taking up a semi-permanent residence in a dungeon complex, they would set all sorts of traps, ambush points, and escape tunnels.  In other words make it a Challenge for the players.Example Room:43 - This room once served as the meditation room for the priestess of lolth who built the dungeon.  It contains some lovely tapestries on the wall with Drow artwork and motiffs in the designs (very heavy, but worth approx 900gp to a collector).  The room has a stone gargoyle carved in the north wall, with a fountain flowing out.  The water in the fountain is magical, and will serve to immaculately clean any metal implement (and restore it to perfect working condition - sharp, repaired, shined) that is placed in it.  In the room, seated at a heavy wooden table, in chairs that were once upholstered, are four orc warriors {4HD, 25hp, AC16, +6 to hit, broadsword (init+8, dam2d4+3)}.  Around the upper level of the room, on the east and west walls there are small eyeslits that can be viewed from the gallery level of the third level of the dungeon (rooms 32 and 34).  There might be anywhere between 4 and 8 goblin archers {1HD, 5hp, AC13, +2 to hit, short bow (init+6, ROF2, dam1d6)} on each side.  In a hollow compartment of one of the table legs there is a potion of heroism and a map through the ankheg maze on level 6.The Heroes in the game are tough enough.  So when designing a challenging adventure, make it nasty, make it fun, and make it surprising.  I recommend the orcs.  If they aren't enough, toughen them up with magic, bugbears, or trolls.  Yeah, trolls.  ooooooh.....Tags: orcsThe Castles and Crusades campaign, set in the World of Greyhawk, continued last night with a great little game.  We only had two players show up (Elliott and Marcy), but I hope we all had as good a time as I did.So the players traveled, once they cleared out the Norker bear-cult nest, on to the Dwarven city of Kreftheim.  Analise (cleric of Ehlonna) is now firmly a member of the party, with her two followers (Byron, starry-eyed bard; and Hilda Ironbottom, reformed Duergar fighter).  There they met the lovely wife of Nords (one of the party members, a Dwarven Fighter of no small renown), and the High Priest of Clangeddin Silverbeard.  From these two, it was clear that the Dwarven Kingdom is in turmoil - with the Old King wanting to keep up good relations with the new Baroness (that the players are questing for), and the young Dwarves (swayed by Great Kingdom gold) who want to sever ties with the Humans, and deliver them up to the Great Kingdom.In the turmoil, the players left the city, under cover of darkness, and rescued one Viney Badeloch, along the way.  Viney has knowledge of where the Kreftring is - the heirloom treaty ring that the players are questing for.  It seems as if the ring has been stolen, and taken (by a Goblin warchief and his body guard) through a gate clear across the continent to Keoland.Following Viney up the mountain, to the base of the glacier, the players find a cave, the entrance to the Glacial Grotto of the Ice Hunter Goblins. Once down in the cave, they uncover a grand dungeon (obviously not built by these primitive goblins), with a thriving subterranean eco-system.

{"title": "Orcs - Considered", "date": "Monday, April 21, 2008", "text": "Orcs are probably one of the favorite races in mine (and most people's) Roleplaying (see my article below about the Extensive influence Tolkien has had on my gaming history).  Bad guys, foils, cheap sword-fodder - sure, but they are also a fascinating thing to consider.  Imagine a race that is (perhaps) created as a shadow of other more gifted races; have a short lifespan; dwell in the nastier parts of the world; are not gifted with magic, intelligence, nor culture; live and die by the sword alone.  Could such a race exist?  I mean, outside of Stalinist era Russia.I have portrayed them (and seen them portrayed) as elemental embodiments of filth and hatred; as a variation on Neanderthal man; as anti-Elves; as just another fantastic humanoid \"why-can't-we-all-get-along\" race; and as the comic relief bad guys that pale before the true evil (as in the Warhammer universe).  I believe I will continue with my strange mix of perhaps the first three concepts I listed above.  Some sort of embodiment of filth - a primitive sort of man with stone age abilities thrust into an age of iron - and the antithesis of the harmonious and magical Fey folk.One last thought - a great old friend of mine summed them up thus: \"An orc is often not encountered unless he (and it almost always males encountered, outside of a lair is performing some task for the tribe - be it scouting, hunting or raiding.  Even the practice of exiling the weaklings serves the tribe - for it continually tests the lands bordering the tribe for their strength to contain stray orcs.  A patrol of orcs is a cunning, animalistic machine that seeks the best advantage against any foe, and will seek to strip all manner of weapons, armor, food, goods, and wealth - all the while reveling in the most brutal techniques of taking these.  On the other hand, an army of orcs is a fearsome sight - it is the whole tribe, on the move, for the single purpose of accomplishing some fearsome martial feat.  Destruction of a neighbor, establishing a new tribal home, or performing the bidding of some stronger, charismatic ally - these are but a few of the possible motives that a tribe could have for going to war.  As it represents the life of the tribe - for all of the warriors (the strength of the tribe, and also its ability to recreate and propagate) are involved, and the stakes in this game are life and death.  The next level of organization - a host of tribes - is almost too terrible to consider, when one thinks of the effects it would have on a civilized land.\"Hail the filthy orc, my friends, and do not underestimate him.Tags: orc, tolkien, Za Frumi"},

{"title": "All my gaming can be blamed on Tolkien", "date": "Monday, April 7, 2008", "text": "DM of the Rings I: The Copious Backstory Like many gamers my age, my ideas for gaming (especially fantasy gaming; but equally fantasy roleplaying and fantasy wargaming) come from a heavy dose of Tolkien, and Tolkien imitators.Sure there are the others - Fritz Lieber, Michael Moorcock, Jack Vance, Robert Howard, and the others - but Tolkien looms largest.My initiation into fantasy gaming came around the end of the 70s, which saw a resurgence of Tolkien-mania in the US - with the release of the Ballantine paperbacks, and also the Hobbit animated TV special, the Bakshi movie (terrible now, but oh I loved it then), and finally the Return of the King TV special.  It all made me gooey and weak in the knees.Around the same time, I was reading (and rereading) the Tolkien stuff, I was also reading Greyfax Grimwald, Peter Pevensey, Thomas Covenant (still don't like him), and Shea and Flick Ohmsford.  But Frodo Baggins stuck with me.  As did uncle Bilbo.  Only later did Fafhrd and Conan and Elric and Cugel come into my quarry of literary foundation stones for writing and gaming. Even today, my current (although still fledgling) Castles and Crusades campaign that is based in the World of Greyhawk has strong themes that are quite Tolkienesque.  There is (unbeknownst to the players - and you who are reading this know who you are) an overriding evil presence in the campaign, who through lesser agents seeks to subvert various neutral forces in the world towards evil; the Dwarves are an old (but not as old as Elves) race that are quite suspicious; the Orcs and other goblinoid races are created in a much lesser sense then Man, Elf or Dwarf were created (and for evil purposes); the current crisis for the world will be solved by a quest on a personal level, despite the engagement of mighty martial forces on all sides. It is a good basis for a worldview of the fantastique.  I do not regret it at all.Tags: Tolkien, Role Playing Games, Castles and Crusades, World of Greyhawk"},
{"title": "Really, what was he thinking", "date": "Sunday, April 6, 2008", "text": "So, last night I was spending some time hanging out with my friend, who just so happens to be the owner of the FLGS that I frequent.  We were talking about stuff, geeking old games, and just having a good time.  There were a couple of games going on in the store (a Legend of the Five Rings game, a 3.5ed D&D game, and some GW miniatures battles).  We were having a pretty good time talking about the weapons of mass destruction presented in GURPS Lensmen.Then this guy walks in the store.He seemed like a pretty feckless typical gamer, hanging out in a FLGS on a Saturday night, maybe just off a day of campaigning, or maybe after a failed date, or maybe just cooling his jets looking for new gaming product to peruse or purchase.  After a couple of rounds through the store, he approaches us up at the counter.  Previously, when asked if he was interested in anything, he cooly replied that he was just looking.  Typical, so far.Then he asks if we knew of any RPGs currently going on, and if we knew (further) of any that accept players - he was looking to join one.  Honest enough question, and I give him kudos for asking it.  Many people are hanging around and looking for game, but don't know to ask for it (or worse, are scared to ask for it).  Gamers, and more typically, FLGS denizens, are usually friendly enough if approached openly by other gamers.Well, the owner and I pondered for a moment or two, thinking of the games that we knew of (I am sadly out of the loop, but I have a LITTLE current game schedule moxie).  The owner looks at me, blank faced.  We both knew the DM who was running the L5R game very well, as well as all the guys in the game, and knew that they had all gamed together for many years, and also that the game was at critical density.  I was thinking of other options when the feckless wandering gamer then spoke up some more.Now, recall that he had just asked if there were any games that we knew of that were open, and that he could join.  He then proceeds to tell us how in the past couple of games that he was involved in, that he was invariably kicked out and asked to not come back by the DMs involved, for power gaming.  He began bragging how he had wizard characters who came up with spells that could cause everyone in a kingdom to start growing hair uncontrollably.  He talked about his area affect damage spells that were unstoppable and that could handle any encounter.  In short, he bragged about being the worst, nightmarish, nasty sort of gamer that a DM could unwittingly invite into their game.  A braggart power gamer.At which point, I knew what I had to do.  I directed him to join the 3.5ed D&D game.  You see, the DM of that game - a long time friend of mine - is the very worst ruthless guileless shameless merciless DM that I know of.  And he makes it worse by wrapping up the abuse inside of roleplay.  Game balance?  Fair scenario?  Joint Storytelling?  Never.  This was indeed the game for our new 6th level Braggart.At this point, before I could boldly point the fellow back to the game room where the attrocities and crimes were being committed (the 3.5 game), one of the long time players in that game came up front to purchase a drink.  I asked him - To protect the blood of the innocents, I will only use initials here.Me - \"So, E, do you think that M has room in his game.  There is a new guy here who is looking for a game to join.\"E - \"Sure.\" (smirk) \"You know M always has room for more players.  He is open to anyone.  Thats the sort of game he runs.\"So off we sent the 6th level Braggart, to join the game.A moment later, I confessed to the FLGS owner, \"B, you know I almost feel guilty for setting that up and sending him back there.\"FLGS - \"What do you mean?  Which do you feel sorry for - Braggart, or DM?\"Me - \"Well, both, but I hope he doesn't ruin M's game.\"FLGS - \"Don't worry about it.  M knows how to handle players like that.  I would be surprised if we hear that he had an adverse effect on M's game.  And if he does, then we know that M deserves it.  Don't worry about it.\"Ahhhh - the wisdom of your FLGS owner.  Don't discount it."},

We'll see how this develops.And more importantly, what Prix has to say about it.Ratik (RPGA version)Well, I've kick started the Castles and Crusades campaign (set in the World of Greyhawk) once again.  I love this stuff.  I am starting out, as I did last August, in the country of Ratik.  Ratik is a great little state, set on the northeastern portion of the Flanaess (the subcontinent of Oerth, commonly referred to as the World of Greyhawk - the 1979 TSR D&D gaming world written by Gary Gygax).In the current RPGA Living Greyhawk, it is about 20 years in the timeline past when I like to host my games.  I really like the World of Greyhawk right up until the time of the Greyhawk Wars.  Everything that occurred in the \"From the Ashes\" campaign setting, and after, is great source material for me, but I don't like my games to follow that time line.  Too depressing.  I just want a very interesting, complex, world in which to drop adventures.  The histories and backstory that my players and I come up with together makes up the plot for our campaigns. The player characters signed on in the city of Marner to escort a large caravan of empty wagons back south and then through Loegrimm, up the valley to a small barony called Vanehold.  Upon reaching Vanehold (after several adventures along the way), the players find that Baron Ridalcar Vane has been murdered, and the long-standing pact he has with the Ukamanini Dwarves is in grave danger.  The seal of the treaty between the Vane household and the Ukamanini Dwarves at Kreftheim is an ancient magical object called the Kreftring.  It has been stolen, and the Dwarves suspected the humans of foul play.  Probably this is because of the prejudice shown to the Demi-Humans (Dwarves, Gnomes and Elves) by the new stock of visitors from Aerdy and the North.The new baron of Vanehold is the son of Ridalcar, Ridalcan.  Unfortunately, he is off on some quest (he fancies himself a Knight Errant), and Ridalcan's younger sister is left to take over.  She pleads with the players to go off into the Rakers mountains, to seek and retrieve the Kreftring.  Secrecy (especially from their feudal lords, the Loegrimm family, and also the ArchBaron Lexnol at Marner) is of the greatest importance on this mission, but also diplomacy (with the Dwarves at Kreftheim) and speed.The game should be good.  Currently looking to increase the number of regular players.  We had 8 at the inaugural game in August, but these days it might be hard to get more than 3 or 4 for a regular Thursday night.Tags: role playing game, greyhawk, castles and crusades"},

{"title": "Cold Wars 2008", "date": "Tuesday, March 11, 2008", "text": "This past weekend was a great time.  I got to attend Cold Wars, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.This gaming convention is one of the oldest in the country, this being its 25th year.  I haven't been going since the first one, but pretty close.  I began attending the HMGS conventions (which now include Cold Wars in March, Historicon in July, and Fall In in November) sometime around 1985, and have been going ever since.The convention is a great time for me.  First, it is a sort of vacation for me from all the responsibilities of life.  I get to go and hang out with friends and indulge my hobby almost completely, if just for a weekend.  This includes gaming, talking about gaming, hosting games, playing games, shopping for games, and buying games.  Miniatures, of course, are the focus of these conventions - appropriate as they are sponsored by the Historical Miniature Gaming Society.  These conventions were once almost purely historical miniatures, but over the years more and more non-historical games have crept in.  For me, and my friends (both in and out of ODMS), these conventions have always been about playing games together in the evening.  These evening games have long been, as often as not, card and board games, rather than miniatures games.  This year was no exception.  Having gotten to the convention on Thursday afternoon, I spent Thursday Evening playing a couple of games of Memoir 44, followed up by a long game of the new Struggle for Rome (a Settlers of Catan-based historical game).  The Memoir games were with Chris - we played the scenario Ste. Mère-Église a couple of times.  Good scenario.  The first game, Chris clobbered me.  This is pretty true-to-form for this scenario, as the Allies have a win-ratio over the Axis of approx 593 to 367 (according to the Days of Wonder scenario ranking page).  The second run-through of the game, we were joined by a friend of the Designer, Richard Borg, who was at the show.  This fellow, who was quite friendly and helpful, gave me key information and tactical tips when I was using my German Armor against Chris, and it lead me to victory.  Groovy.  Without the assistance, I never would have won.Friday was a busy day.  First, there was the traditional breakfast at the Lancaster Host Resort - the hotel that has hosted Cold Wars and Historicon for many-a-year (since it left the Penn-Harris in Camp Hill, PA).  We used to eat breakfast at the Lapps restaurant next door, but have been in the Hotel for a long time.  Then, there was some shopping in the flea market, which officially opened at Noon - no, wait, there was a screw up (typical) - One o'clock.  This gave me just enough time to buy used copies of Heroquest and Medina.  Then I had to rush off to the New Holland room.At 2:00pm on Friday, I was hosting a game of The Sword and the Flame.  The game was called the \"Heights of Jasani\", and is based on a scenario that is due for publication (hopefully soon) from a to-be-announced publisher (just as soon as we find a cartographer to finish up the maps for the scenarios...).  The game was excellent, and featured six really fine players - five of them being long-time veterans of TSATF (including Tom Anderson, Nigel Clarke, Rick Norton, and Steve Winter - all of the ColonialWars group).  All of the gamers were gentlemen.  I have been running TSATF games like this with Chris Borucki (I am his co-GM) at the HMGS conventions since 1999.  Almost every one of our games have been quite successful with good gamers and good games.  The scenarios aren't always balanced, and sometimes (doh! - Historicon 2007 comes to mind) I try some knuckle-headed new rules that don't always work - but the games almost always turn out to be quite fun anyway.Friday night was no less excellent than Thursday night.  More board games, including more Memoir 44 - this time with me losing to Odin Bazely.  I played the French Resistance and got trounced.  I really like this game.  So much so, that I purchased the Eastern Front expansion, and the Terrain Pack expansion at the convention.  Cool - now I can do loads more maps and scenarios (there are something like 1200 - yes, one thousand and two hundred - scenarios posted on the Days of Wonder web page).Saturday came.  More breakfast.  This time, I loaded up on some rather explosive combinations of food - more about that later.  The day was spent shopping and also catching up on some homework(!) - grad school is never off limits.  The evening drew nigh, and I wandered down to the Dealers hall with Jon Krigbaum.  We walked around (what a wonderful thing the dealers hall is at an HMGS convention) for about an hour, and all of a sudden a storm blew through and knocked out the power at the hotel convention center.  We were in the dark!  Thousands of product-starved gamers, and a few measly dealers who had nothing to stop the hordes but their own measly bodies.  Luckily the forces of justice prevailed, and there wasn't a riot.  Good thing too, cause we were guarding the treasures to be found at the Miniatures of Chesepeake booth, run by fellow ODMS member Carl Sciscio. Chris, Odin and I left and went to get some Chinese food for dinner, and afterwards realized that the power still was not turned on, so we journeyed to the nearby town of New Holland (named for the room that the Colonial Gamers inhabit at the convention), to visit one of the best game stores I have ever been in - Six Feet Under Games.  Wow, what a cool place.After a while (the group couldn't take the nasty effusions that were bubbling out of me from my explosive breakfast), we returned to the hotel.  I voided my defiled bowels, which left a stain in that corner of Pennsylvania, and we left for the open gaming area.During the day Chris played in a singles tournament of Warhammer Ancient Battles.  He did well in his first game - against a Crusades army - but fared quite poorly against some really tough Norman Armies in his second and third games.  We got to the dealers hall just ahead of my own noxious cloud, and proceeded to play some games of Battlelore - wow, what a game!  I played first Odin and then Chris in Battlelore - we played the battle of Agincourt, and I got to be (lucky me - this is a wet dream for me and I bet those guys didn't even know - one of my favorite battles, and me playing my favorite side) the English.  We few, we happy few!  Well, I lost and then I won.  This was too much for Chris, who had already been slaughtered by Normans.  Too much was too much, and he took a break as we progressed to more refined gaming fare.We next played (Jim Russell joining Jon Krigbaum, Odin Bazely and myself) Family Business.  Dead Gangsters Everywhere!  Dead, Dead, they're all Dead!!  Finally, late Saturday night, Chris rejoined us and we played (oh boy) a five player round of Web of Power.  This was awesome, with me and Chris tying for first place.A great convention.  I shopped for some new miniatures (but didn't buy any).  I played lots of great miniature and board games.  I bought some classic used gaming stuff.  I hung out with the best friends a gamer ever had, and it was a really fun time.  Mission Accomplished.ps- I know I didn't mention the Pirate theme that the convention had this year.  Suffice it to say that after about 10 minutes of watching paunchy balding white guys dressed in bad pirate costumes and hosting bad pirate skirmish games all the while ranting \"arrgh\" and \"shiver me timbers\" and \"that it be, Jim me lad!\" was too much for me, and I pretended it wasn't happening.Tags: miniatures, board games, hmgs, cold wars, memoir 44, battlelore, web of power, the sword and the flame, wargaming,"},

I plan on using them in an upcoming game.Runequest FiguresLegends of the Ancient World FiguresFantasy Trip FiguresFree Runequest Adventure, with paper charactersI have always loved old school roleplaying games.  Old school means 1st edition AD&D.These days, reimagined under the Castles and Crusades line from Troll Lord Games, or even (if you are stalwart of heart) the Hackmaster system.When I was in High School (79-83), every new fantasy book or movie that came out just gave us more fodder for our games.  One of the best (don't laugh) is still Excalibur (1981).Now watch this video, and let me know if it doesn't get you weak in the knees.  I know, I know, and the dialog (all six words) are in spanish.  But still, it makes me want to roll up a good old fashioned single classed fighter, and go out and start hacking up orcs.  Or something like that."},
{"title": "Gary Gygax dead, Age 69", "date": "Tuesday, March 4, 2008", "text": "Dungeons and Dragons was the big icebreaker.  I had played wargames before then, but it was the game that really opened up everything for me in gaming.  One of these days I'll post my boring personal history of gaming, but for now, let me say that other my Religious Faith, gaming (and the friends it has brought me) has had the biggest effect on all of the different aspects of my life.I owe almost all of this to Gary Gygax for making it happen.I tip my great helm to you Zagyg, fare thee well.  May we meet again.A sad day.      Dungeons & Dragons co-creator dies at 69                                                By EMILY FREDRIX, Associated Press Writer                 Gary Gygax, who co-created the fantasy game Dungeons & Dragons and helped start the role-playing phenomenon, died Tuesday morning at his home in Lake Geneva. He was 69. He had been suffering from health problems for several years, including an abdominal aneurysm, said his wife, Gail Gygax. Gygax and Dave Arneson developed Dungeons & Dragons in 1974 using medieval characters and mythical creatures. The game known for its oddly shaped dice became a hit, particularly among teenage boys, and eventually was turned into video games, books and movies. Gygax always enjoyed hearing from the game's legion of devoted fans, many of whom would stop by the family's home in Lake Geneva, about 55 miles southwest of Milwaukee, his wife said. Despite his declining health, he hosted weekly games of Dungeons & Dragons as recently as January, she said. \"It really meant a lot to him to hear from people from over the years about how he helped them become a doctor, a lawyer, a policeman, what he gave them,\" Gygax said. \"He really enjoyed that.\" Dungeons & Dragons players create fictional characters and carry out their adventures with the help of complicated rules. The quintessential geek pastime, it spawned a wealth of copycat games and later inspired a whole genre of computer games that's still growing in popularity. Funeral arrangements are pending. Besides his wife, Gygax is survived by six children.The above from http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080304/ap_en_ot/obit_gygaxEnter the ICHC online Poker Cats Contest!"},
{"title": "Battlelore - Dwarves on Cows", "date": "Tuesday, March 4, 2008", "text": "What can I say - any game that features Dwarves riding on Shaggy Cattle has got to be alright with me.I am really excited about playing Battlelore with Chris.  This is one of the two player games that we want to give a try, so hopefully we will be able to find the time to fit it in.The game looks really good, and I've seen Richard Borg hanging out in the open gaming area of the HMGS Conventions, showing off his games based on \"the system\".The system is used in Battle Cry, Memoir 44, Battlelore, C&C: Ancients, and (one of my favorites) Queen's Gambit.I will be bringing El Grande to Cold Wars.This is still one of my favorite games.  It is an area control game, something that I also like about Andromeda.  The mechanics are a little clunky, and the rhythm of the game is ENTIRELY apparent until after you've played a half a game or so - but with experienced gamers, it sure is awesome.  I also like it with an almost full house of players 4 or 5 is perfect. One of the things I am really looking forward to playing at Cold Wars is Memoir 44, with Chris Borucki. I have heard that the best way to play this is with 8 players, but we'll have to see about that. I like the rules, have played some of the scenarios out of the book, and am looking forward to playing more. One of the add-ons is the Eastern Front, which includes a Russian Army.  Definitely on my list.ChuckI am involved in two miniatures events at Cold Wars 2008.The first is Warhammer Historical Battles.  I will be playing in a doubles tournament with Chris Borucki - I will be bringing my Early Imperial Romans.The second is a game of The Sword and the Flame.  This is an actual Con game, in the Preliminary Event Listing, taking place on Friday.  It will be a Northwest Frontier Game, with the British against the Pathans.    This game will be held Friday, March 7, at 2pm in the Colonials Room at the convention.  Here is the write up.F-441 The Heights At Jasani Colonial; 2 PM; Length: 4 hrs; Location: New Holland; Table: NH-1; Hosted by: Chuck Turnitsa; Scale: 25mm; Sponsored by: Old Dominion Military Society; Rules: TSATF/20; No. of Players: 6.The Jasani Pass is the only way to get from the British Cantonment to the old Mughal fortress at Dhivalgar. Keeping the Pass open and free from marauding Pathan raiders is a daunting challenge but one the Colonel from the Cantonment must face. The local Pathan tribes have been brought together in a rare moment of cooperation by the local Mulla in an effort to rid the mountains of the hated Ferengi. The struggle for this small, insignificant mountain pass crescendos as the players try to best each other.I hope to see you there!"},
