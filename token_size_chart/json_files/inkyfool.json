{"title": "The Gift of Thrift", "date": "Monday 9 October 2023", "text": "Start with something simple. We've got the verb give, which we all know, and the thing that you give is a gift. They're quite obviously related. This is Not Interesting.Then you've got people who use the word gift as a verb, as in \"I gifted it to him.\" That's a bit odd because it's verb to noun to verb again. But it's still pretty obvious.Then you have the verb drive. And when the wind drives the snow into a pile that is a snowdrift, because the thing you drive is a drift. And when the wind and the waves drive a ship from its course, that movement is called the drift.And then the noun drift can get turned into a verb and the boat starts drifting. It is the gift that keeps gifting.And then you've got the verb thrive, meaning to prosper, flourish and generally quomodocunquize. And from that you get the noun thrift, but only because thrift used to mean wealth. Then its meaning wandered until it meant savings, and then the foolish habit of saving money, which is thrifty.(I should point out that I always save all my money for a rainy day, but I live in England, so my savings don't last long.)But that's why we still have spendthrift meaning someone who spends all their fortune.And then you have sieve and sift, which has also been re-verbed to mean exactly the same thing. And just as gift relates to given and drift to driven, so rift relates to riven (although the connection there is much further back in the Norse). And even swift is related to swivel. The verb in between was swive/swifan which just meant to move. But then it became the standard medieval term for to have sex with, as in:'For John,' said he, 'als ever moot I thrive, If that I may, yon wenche will I swive.Swive was a bit rude, even then, and has since vanished, but swift and swivel remain. It's a bit like how true relates to truth, just as rue relates to ruth. Ruth is the opposite of ruthless. But we don't use ruth anymore, largely because Milton used it in the line:Look homeward angel now, and melt with ruthAnd that's so beautiful that nobody will ever better it; even though, to modern ears, it sounds like an invitation from a woman with a raclette*. That's it.

{"title": "Today is Mayday", "date": "Thursday 11 May 2023", "text": "Today is the first of May, or that's what Shakespeare thought, as did all proper Englishmen. May, for him, ran from May 11th to June 10th. The reason for this is reasonably simple. Ancient folk noticed that there were 365 days in a year. This allowed for calendars etc. Life was simple.Then Ancient Romans noticed that this wasn't quite right. In fact, there were 365 and a quarter days in a year. That's how long it takes for the earth to go round the sun once.So Julius Caesar decreed that everyone should have a new calendar with an extra day every four years. This is pretty familiar stuff: it's February 29th, a leap year.Because the calendar was decreed by Julius, it got called the Julian Calendar. Life was simple again for a millennium and a half.Then Renaissance Italians noticed that, in fact, a year was 365 and just less than a quarter days. This upset them terribly. The reason they were so terribly upset was that religious festivals. Christmas is meant to happen on the exact anniversary of Christ's birth. The same went Epiphany and Assumption and Annunciation, not to mention all the Saints' Days. Th dating of Easter was also terribly complicated, but terribly important.The Renaissance Italians realised that they had been celebrating everything on the Wrong Day. That's because the day-calendar had been slipping out of sync with the solar-calendar. Not by much, mind you. Only by one day every century and a half. But as this had been going on for a millennium and a half, it meant that everything was wrong by ten days. So Pope Gregory decreed a new calendar where a leap day is missed out every century or so. And he also decreed that we had to get everything back to it's proper anniversary. So on October the 4th 1582, he announced that tomorrow would be October the 15th.Thus all of Catholic Europe moved forward ten days, and called the new system the Gregorian Calendar.But England was Protestant, and we were very suspicious. We decided that all this looked very like a dastardly Catholic plot and that we weren't going to fall for it, and Brexit meant Brexit, and we were quite happy with the old system, thank you very much.So you had the odd situation of a ten day gap between England and Europe. When, it was May 1st in Dover, it was May 11th in Calais, even though France is (alas) only 26 miles away. This had all sorts of odd effects. One is the belief that Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same day. In a way they did. They both died on April 23rd 1616. It's just that that wasn't the same day. April 23rd was really May 3rd, or perhaps the other way around.It does mean, though that Shakespeare's May was a lot merrier than ours. It skipped out early May, which is cold, and added in early June. If you are in England now, you'll notice that trees are much leafier than that they were ten days ago. So all his references to sun and flowers and darling buds of May, are a little bit off.It also means that Chaucer's April was a lot more springlike that our is, and that December was a lot colder, because it contained what we'd call early January (which is when Christmas was).This whole amusing situation lasted until 1752, when Britain finally capitulated and joined the Gregorian Catholics. That in turn really pissed off our colonists in North America, and caused the American revolution.Well, not quite. But it was a small contributing factor. America was a lot more puritan and anti-catholic that Britain was. So if you were a Puritan farmer in Massachusetts, and you were already annoyed about being ruled by people thousands of miles away, forcing silly laws on you without so much as a 'by your leave', then it didn't help. And it was, for years, a contentious bone.And the Russian Orthodox Church is still on the Julian calendar, which is why they have their Christmas in what we call January. This even caused some kerfuffle in Ukraine, with people undecided about whether to use the Western date or the Russian (boo!) one.Midsummer Night's Dream actually takes place on the night of April 30/May 1st. When Theseus finds the young lovers he says:No doubt they rose up early to observeThe rite of May, and hearing our intent,Came here in grace of our solemnity.And today is the day. Today is Mayday. And the distress call MAYDAY! MAYDAY! MAYDAY! is just the French way of saying 'Help me!'M'AIDEZ! M'AIDEZ! M'AIDEZ!The Inky Fool responds to the fuel crisis.P.S. Obviously this could all have been solved if we'd just used Stone Henge, which marks the solar year. So, really, the English were right all along."},

{"title": "Flying Saucers, Pelicans, Prisons and Albatrosses", "date": "Thursday 24 June 2021", "text": "Today is, of course, the 74th anniversary of the Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting. The event is celebrated by lexicographers everywhere because it gave the English language two new terms: flying saucer and pelicanist.Kenneth Arnold was a businessman and aviator who, on June 24th 1947, saw nine thingummybobs flying past Mount Ranier in Washington State at over a thousand miles an hour. Or, he says he saw them. This blog post will not answer the great question as to whether extraterrestrial life visits earth, because, though I know the answer, I'm not telling.The question as to who first called these thingummybobs flying saucers is rather vexed. Kenneth Arnold says that he didn't use the term, that he only said that the motion of their flight resembled a saucer being skipped across the surface of a lake. However, there was a journalist who insisted that Arnold said the objects looked like saucers, and the term could have been invented by any of a hundred headline writers who wrote about the Great Event.(Incidentally, I have skipped a lot of stones across lakes, but never a saucer. I've never even heard of somebody skipping a saucer across a lake, and can only dream of having that much redundant crockery. We all need a dream.)However it happened, and whoever said what, the term flying saucer came into being as a result of this event 74 years ago today. Of course, there were naysayers. There were those who said that the flying saucers were, in fact, clouds, or very distant mountain tops, or very near drops of water on the windows of Mr Arnold's own aircraft, or pelicans.The pelican theory is curious. Pelicans are large birds. Their wingspans can be over three metres (ten feet). But they don't really resemble saucers and they don't fly at over a thousand miles an hour unless they're in the most terrible hurry.The pelican theory is a bit silly. It attempts to explain away a not-that-believable story with an even less likely one. It would be a lot simpler to suggest that Mr Arnold imagined the whole thing. The pelicans are unlikely, and if I have learned anything in this life, it is that one should never rely on an unlikely pelican.So silly is the pelican idea, that flying saucer enthusiasts coined the term pelicanist for those who would explain away all sightings with unlikely substitutes. By extension the word can be used for anybody who proposes a preposterous but naturalistic explanation for an inexplicable event.(Incidentally, and without wanting to sidetrack myself, there's a lot of pelicanism when it comes to Shakespeare. The (idiotic) theory that William Shakespeare did not write Shakespeare often runs something along the lines of \"no man could never have written something so wonderful, that's simply not believable; so it must have been written by someone else\").Anyway, there are a lot of pelicans on the west coast of America. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the bay of St Francis they found an island absolutely covered with them. So they named it Pelican Island. Except being Spaniards they did it all in Spanish. And that's why San Francisco bay contains the island of Alcatraz, because alcatraz is just Spanish for pelican. It comes from the Arabic al ghattas meaning sea-eagle.The English used to use the word alcatras, largely because pelicans aren't native to Britain so we might as well use the Spanish word. However, we never seemed to be entirely sure what an alcatras was. The OED lists alcatras as an English word, or at least a word used by the English, but one of the definitions is \"Perhaps: an albatross\".This makes perfect sense because albatross is simply an alternative way of pronouncing alcatraz. Pelicans and albatrosses are both huge nautical birds, and could quite forgivably be mistaken for each other. This means that they are unidentified flying objects.Of course, the albatross/alcatraz/alcatras has earned an immortal place in English literature:A gorgeous bird is the pelican,Whose beak will hold more than his bellican.He can put in his beakFood enough for a week.But I’m damned if I see how in hellecan.The Inky Fool was in a terrible hurryP.S. The proximate cause of this post was The Times Crossword on Tuesday. The clue for 1 across was:1 Pelican that's not more, unfortunately right after feline enters (8)right after feline = cat rthat enters the word alas, which means unfortunately.You get al-catr-asWhich is an obsolete synonym for pelican."},
{"title": "The Etymological Week", "date": "Friday 14 May 2021", "text": "The week is a curious thing: the division of our lives into a revolving, unfinishing cycles of seven days. Especially as seven days bears no relation to anything at all. Some people, rather foolishly, think that seven days is a quarter of the lunar cycle: seven days from new moon to half full, another week to full, another week waning to half, and another week until it disappears. But there's a problem. This system is two days out. Four weeks is 28 days, and a lunar cycle lasts 30 days.This means that the two systems go out of sync very quickly, and after only seven months they are as far as could possibly be. Time is a useful thing, because we use it. If I lend you some money and want it back after seven moons, we need to both agree on what that means. If one of us is counting 28 weeks and the other is watching the sky, there is liable to be a fight. Anyhow, I've been reading The Week: An essay on the origin and development of the seven-day cycle by F.H. Colson. It has been something of a revelation.The week began with the Jews. Efforts to backdate it to Babylon are implausible, largely for the reasons given above. Whatever you may think of the first chapter of the book of Genesis (and opinions, I'm told, vary), the Jews had been resting every seventh day since at least the first half of the first millennium BC. And the Romans thought this was amazing, and weird and crazy.The Romans looked at the Jews rather in the way that some modern Westerners look at Tibet or India. The Jews were eastern and mysterious and they had this mysterious ancient religion, which was really ancient, and probably contained some really profound kind of ancient wisdom that was really ancient.So just as rich bored Londoners can suddenly get really keen on some ancient Tibetan practice as a bit of a fad, so the rich bored Roman could bore everybody at the dinner party about how he had taken up resting on the seventh day, and it had really grounded him, and you should try it yourself, because those Jews are just so, so ancient. And did you know they don't have statues of their god because it's a really spiritual religion?Juvenal made fun of such people in his 14th Satire, although his main target was idle people who do things just because they're fashionable, and then get Much Too Into It. You start with the faddish Sabbath and the new-fangled seven-day week, and the you get carried away, and so do your children.Some who have had a father who reveres the Sabbath, worship nothing but the clouds, and the divinity of the heavens, and see no difference between eating swine's flesh, from which their father abstained, and that of man; and in time they take to circumcision. Having been wont to flout the laws of Rome, they learn and practise and revere the Jewish law, and all that Moses committed to his secret tome, forbidding to point out the way to any not worshipping the same rites, and conducting none but the circumcised to the desired fountain. For all which the father was to blame, who gave up every seventh day to idleness, keeping it apart from all the concerns of life.Resting every seven days is a gateway drug.The important thing here is that the seven-day week spread through the Roman Empire before Christianity did. The Christians existed at the time, but they were still a tiny little sect. The Romans were still basically interested in pagan gods and astrology.The Romans loved astrology and did everything according to the Seven Planets, which wandered across the sky. So far as the Roman were concerned there were the Fixed Stars (all those ones in the background that never move in relation to each other), and then there were seven things visible with the naked eye that wandered around. They were the moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. These were wandering stars and in Latin each one was a stella errans, but the Greeks were still around and still speaking Greek and the Greek for wanderers is planetes. Hence planet, which just means wanderer.Pluto may not be a planet, but the sun is. So you've got the seven day week and seven planets so of course you put them together. Saturnday, Sunday, Moonday etc. That way you could have an Astrological Week, and if you were planning to start a war or fall in love you could find the Right Day To Do It. The full Latin week went like this:Sunday = dies Solis = Sun/solar = ApolloMonday = dies Lunae = Moon/lunar = changeable Tuesday = dies Martis = Mars/Martian = God of War = martial as in court martialWednesday = dies Mercurii = Mercury = mercurial, ephemeralThursday = dies Iovis = Jove/Jupiter = jovialFriday = dies Veneris = Venus goddess of love = to venerate of love something/venereal diseaseSaturday = dies Saturni = Saturn = unlucky/miserable/saturnineThe Romans loved their astrological week and even tried to apply it retrospectively to the Jews, who obviously didn't do anything on Saturday because Saturn was unlucky. You can still see the Tuesday to Friday gods in French and SpanishMardi Martes MarsMercredi Miercoles MercuryJeudi Jueves JoveVendredi Viernes VenusAnd, weirdly enough, all the Roman names survive in Welsh: Dydd-sull, -llun, -marwth, -mercher, -iou, -gwener, -sadwrn.When the Christians came along they obviously tried to Christianise things. Saturday was the sabbath and Sunday was the Lord's Day, thus the Spanish Sabado and Domingo. But the week spread much faster than Christianity did. It arrived in Northern Europe while they were still pagan. That's why in English (and German) the days were passed over to equivalent pagan gods. Mars was identified with the Germanic god Tyw (who's actually etymologically related to Zeus and Jove), hence Tuesday.Mercury was identified with Wodin (whom you've heard of from the Vikings) hence Wednesday.Thor and Jupiter were both Thunder-Gods, so Jove's Day became Thor's Day/Thursday in English. But in German they're more direct and just call it Donnerstag, which literally means Thunder Day. (That's the same Donner that you get in the reindeer names Donner and Blitzen, which mean thunder and lightning, which is why the German army's tactic of lightning warfare, was called the blitzkrieg, or just the blitz, which I like to think of as London being attacked by flying reindeer.)Venus was identified with the female goddess Frigg, hence Friday.The Northern Europeans didn't use the planets because they weren't into astrology, because it's much too cloudy round these parts. In England you can detect the sun occasionally, in Wales never. The other planets might as well not exist.But the week was just popular. It spread northward even without planets to pull it there. It is strange to think that there is no seven-day week in Homer, nor in any of the Greek dramatists; and strange to think that this arbitrary seven day cycle has been running without pause for at least two and half thousand years, probably much longer. It is also strange to think that two thousand years ago people thought that there was a correct day of the week to be in love, as though from Saturday to Thursday you might be quite icy and indifferent and then suddenly perk up on the day of Venus. We moderns would never, ever have such a silly idea."},

There were those who said that the flying saucers were, in fact, clouds, or very distant mountain tops, or very near drops of water on the windows of Mr Arnold's own aircraft, or pelicans.The pelican theory is curious. Pelicans are large birds. Their wingspans can be over three metres (ten feet). But they don't really resemble saucers and they don't fly at over a thousand miles an hour unless they're in the most terrible hurry.The pelican theory is a bit silly. It attempts to explain away a not-that-believable story with an even less likely one. It would be a lot simpler to suggest that Mr Arnold imagined the whole thing. The pelicans are unlikely, and if I have learned anything in this life, it is that one should never rely on an unlikely pelican.So silly is the pelican idea, that flying saucer enthusiasts coined the term pelicanist for those who would explain away all sightings with unlikely substitutes. By extension the word can be used for anybody who proposes a preposterous but naturalistic explanation for an inexplicable event.(Incidentally, and without wanting to sidetrack myself, there's a lot of pelicanism when it comes to Shakespeare. The (idiotic) theory that William Shakespeare did not write Shakespeare often runs something along the lines of \"no man could never have written something so wonderful, that's simply not believable; so it must have been written by someone else\").Anyway, there are a lot of pelicans on the west coast of America. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the bay of St Francis they found an island absolutely covered with them. So they named it Pelican Island. Except being Spaniards they did it all in Spanish. And that's why San Francisco bay contains the island of Alcatraz, because alcatraz is just Spanish for pelican. It comes from the Arabic al ghattas meaning sea-eagle.The English used to use the word alcatras, largely because pelicans aren't native to Britain so we might as well use the Spanish word. However, we never seemed to be entirely sure what an alcatras was. The OED lists alcatras as an English word, or at least a word used by the English, but one of the definitions is \"Perhaps: an albatross\".This makes perfect sense because albatross is simply an alternative way of pronouncing alcatraz. Pelicans and albatrosses are both huge nautical birds, and could quite forgivably be mistaken for each other. This means that they are unidentified flying objects.Of course, the albatross/alcatraz/alcatras has earned an immortal place in English literature:A gorgeous bird is the pelican,Whose beak will hold more than his bellican.He can put in his beakFood enough for a week.But I’m damned if I see how in hellecan.The Inky Fool was in a terrible hurryP.S. The proximate cause of this post was The Times Crossword on Tuesday. The clue for 1 across was:1 Pelican that's not more, unfortunately right after feline enters (8)right after feline = cat rthat enters the word alas, which means unfortunately.You get al-catr-asWhich is an obsolete synonym for pelican."},
{"title": "The Etymological Week", "date": "Friday 14 May 2021", "text": "The week is a curious thing: the division of our lives into a revolving, unfinishing cycles of seven days. Especially as seven days bears no relation to anything at all. Some people, rather foolishly, think that seven days is a quarter of the lunar cycle: seven days from new moon to half full, another week to full, another week waning to half, and another week until it disappears. But there's a problem. This system is two days out. Four weeks is 28 days, and a lunar cycle lasts 30 days.This means that the two systems go out of sync very quickly, and after only seven months they are as far as could possibly be. Time is a useful thing, because we use it. If I lend you some money and want it back after seven moons, we need to both agree on what that means. If one of us is counting 28 weeks and the other is watching the sky, there is liable to be a fight. Anyhow, I've been reading The Week: An essay on the origin and development of the seven-day cycle by F.H. Colson. It has been something of a revelation.The week began with the Jews. Efforts to backdate it to Babylon are implausible, largely for the reasons given above. Whatever you may think of the first chapter of the book of Genesis (and opinions, I'm told, vary), the Jews had been resting every seventh day since at least the first half of the first millennium BC. And the Romans thought this was amazing, and weird and crazy.The Romans looked at the Jews rather in the way that some modern Westerners look at Tibet or India. The Jews were eastern and mysterious and they had this mysterious ancient religion, which was really ancient, and probably contained some really profound kind of ancient wisdom that was really ancient.So just as rich bored Londoners can suddenly get really keen on some ancient Tibetan practice as a bit of a fad, so the rich bored Roman could bore everybody at the dinner party about how he had taken up resting on the seventh day, and it had really grounded him, and you should try it yourself, because those Jews are just so, so ancient. And did you know they don't have statues of their god because it's a really spiritual religion?Juvenal made fun of such people in his 14th Satire, although his main target was idle people who do things just because they're fashionable, and then get Much Too Into It. You start with the faddish Sabbath and the new-fangled seven-day week, and the you get carried away, and so do your children.Some who have had a father who reveres the Sabbath, worship nothing but the clouds, and the divinity of the heavens, and see no difference between eating swine's flesh, from which their father abstained, and that of man; and in time they take to circumcision. Having been wont to flout the laws of Rome, they learn and practise and revere the Jewish law, and all that Moses committed to his secret tome, forbidding to point out the way to any not worshipping the same rites, and conducting none but the circumcised to the desired fountain. For all which the father was to blame, who gave up every seventh day to idleness, keeping it apart from all the concerns of life.Resting every seven days is a gateway drug.The important thing here is that the seven-day week spread through the Roman Empire before Christianity did. The Christians existed at the time, but they were still a tiny little sect. The Romans were still basically interested in pagan gods and astrology.The Romans loved astrology and did everything according to the Seven Planets, which wandered across the sky. So far as the Roman were concerned there were the Fixed Stars (all those ones in the background that never move in relation to each other), and then there were seven things visible with the naked eye that wandered around. They were the moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. These were wandering stars and in Latin each one was a stella errans, but the Greeks were still around and still speaking Greek and the Greek for wanderers is planetes. Hence planet, which just means wanderer.Pluto may not be a planet, but the sun is. So you've got the seven day week and seven planets so of course you put them together. Saturnday, Sunday, Moonday etc. That way you could have an Astrological Week, and if you were planning to start a war or fall in love you could find the Right Day To Do It. The full Latin week went like this:Sunday = dies Solis = Sun/solar = ApolloMonday = dies Lunae = Moon/lunar = changeable Tuesday = dies Martis = Mars/Martian = God of War = martial as in court martialWednesday = dies Mercurii = Mercury = mercurial, ephemeralThursday = dies Iovis = Jove/Jupiter = jovialFriday = dies Veneris = Venus goddess of love = to venerate of love something/venereal diseaseSaturday = dies Saturni = Saturn = unlucky/miserable/saturnineThe Romans loved their astrological week and even tried to apply it retrospectively to the Jews, who obviously didn't do anything on Saturday because Saturn was unlucky. You can still see the Tuesday to Friday gods in French and SpanishMardi Martes MarsMercredi Miercoles MercuryJeudi Jueves JoveVendredi Viernes VenusAnd, weirdly enough, all the Roman names survive in Welsh: Dydd-sull, -llun, -marwth, -mercher, -iou, -gwener, -sadwrn.When the Christians came along they obviously tried to Christianise things. Saturday was the sabbath and Sunday was the Lord's Day, thus the Spanish Sabado and Domingo. But the week spread much faster than Christianity did. It arrived in Northern Europe while they were still pagan. That's why in English (and German) the days were passed over to equivalent pagan gods. Mars was identified with the Germanic god Tyw (who's actually etymologically related to Zeus and Jove), hence Tuesday.Mercury was identified with Wodin (whom you've heard of from the Vikings) hence Wednesday.Thor and Jupiter were both Thunder-Gods, so Jove's Day became Thor's Day/Thursday in English. But in German they're more direct and just call it Donnerstag, which literally means Thunder Day. (That's the same Donner that you get in the reindeer names Donner and Blitzen, which mean thunder and lightning, which is why the German army's tactic of lightning warfare, was called the blitzkrieg, or just the blitz, which I like to think of as London being attacked by flying reindeer.)Venus was identified with the female goddess Frigg, hence Friday.The Northern Europeans didn't use the planets because they weren't into astrology, because it's much too cloudy round these parts. In England you can detect the sun occasionally, in Wales never. The other planets might as well not exist.But the week was just popular. It spread northward even without planets to pull it there. It is strange to think that there is no seven-day week in Homer, nor in any of the Greek dramatists; and strange to think that this arbitrary seven day cycle has been running without pause for at least two and half thousand years, probably much longer. It is also strange to think that two thousand years ago people thought that there was a correct day of the week to be in love, as though from Saturday to Thursday you might be quite icy and indifferent and then suddenly perk up on the day of Venus. We moderns would never, ever have such a silly idea."},
{"title": "The Gift of Thrift", "date": "Monday 9 October 2023", "text": "Start with something simple. We've got the verb give, which we all know, and the thing that you give is a gift. They're quite obviously related. This is Not Interesting.Then you've got people who use the word gift as a verb, as in \"I gifted it to him.\" That's a bit odd because it's verb to noun to verb again. But it's still pretty obvious.Then you have the verb drive. And when the wind drives the snow into a pile that is a snowdrift, because the thing you drive is a drift. And when the wind and the waves drive a ship from its course, that movement is called the drift.And then the noun drift can get turned into a verb and the boat starts drifting. It is the gift that keeps gifting.And then you've got the verb thrive, meaning to prosper, flourish and generally quomodocunquize. And from that you get the noun thrift, but only because thrift used to mean wealth. Then its meaning wandered until it meant savings, and then the foolish habit of saving money, which is thrifty.(I should point out that I always save all my money for a rainy day, but I live in England, so my savings don't last long.)But that's why we still have spendthrift meaning someone who spends all their fortune.And then you have sieve and sift, which has also been re-verbed to mean exactly the same thing. And just as gift relates to given and drift to driven, so rift relates to riven (although the connection there is much further back in the Norse). And even swift is related to swivel. The verb in between was swive/swifan which just meant to move. But then it became the standard medieval term for to have sex with, as in:'For John,' said he, 'als ever moot I thrive, If that I may, yon wenche will I swive.Swive was a bit rude, even then, and has since vanished, but swift and swivel remain. It's a bit like how true relates to truth, just as rue relates to ruth. Ruth is the opposite of ruthless. But we don't use ruth anymore, largely because Milton used it in the line:Look homeward angel now, and melt with ruthAnd that's so beautiful that nobody will ever better it; even though, to modern ears, it sounds like an invitation from a woman with a raclette*. That's it. That's what I was driving at, if you catch my drift.A bit rude*Ruth's cooking is very interesting, partially because she uses alien corn."},
{"title": "Today is Mayday", "date": "Thursday 11 May 2023", "text": "Today is the first of May, or that's what Shakespeare thought, as did all proper Englishmen. May, for him, ran from May 11th to June 10th. The reason for this is reasonably simple. Ancient folk noticed that there were 365 days in a year. This allowed for calendars etc. Life was simple.Then Ancient Romans noticed that this wasn't quite right. In fact, there were 365 and a quarter days in a year. That's how long it takes for the earth to go round the sun once.So Julius Caesar decreed that everyone should have a new calendar with an extra day every four years. This is pretty familiar stuff: it's February 29th, a leap year.Because the calendar was decreed by Julius, it got called the Julian Calendar. Life was simple again for a millennium and a half.Then Renaissance Italians noticed that, in fact, a year was 365 and just less than a quarter days. This upset them terribly. The reason they were so terribly upset was that religious festivals. Christmas is meant to happen on the exact anniversary of Christ's birth. The same went Epiphany and Assumption and Annunciation, not to mention all the Saints' Days. Th dating of Easter was also terribly complicated, but terribly important.The Renaissance Italians realised that they had been celebrating everything on the Wrong Day. That's because the day-calendar had been slipping out of sync with the solar-calendar. Not by much, mind you. Only by one day every century and a half. But as this had been going on for a millennium and a half, it meant that everything was wrong by ten days. So Pope Gregory decreed a new calendar where a leap day is missed out every century or so. And he also decreed that we had to get everything back to it's proper anniversary. So on October the 4th 1582, he announced that tomorrow would be October the 15th.Thus all of Catholic Europe moved forward ten days, and called the new system the Gregorian Calendar.But England was Protestant, and we were very suspicious. We decided that all this looked very like a dastardly Catholic plot and that we weren't going to fall for it, and Brexit meant Brexit, and we were quite happy with the old system, thank you very much.So you had the odd situation of a ten day gap between England and Europe. When, it was May 1st in Dover, it was May 11th in Calais, even though France is (alas) only 26 miles away. This had all sorts of odd effects. One is the belief that Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same day. In a way they did. They both died on April 23rd 1616. It's just that that wasn't the same day. April 23rd was really May 3rd, or perhaps the other way around.It does mean, though that Shakespeare's May was a lot merrier than ours. It skipped out early May, which is cold, and added in early June. If you are in England now, you'll notice that trees are much leafier than that they were ten days ago. So all his references to sun and flowers and darling buds of May, are a little bit off.It also means that Chaucer's April was a lot more springlike that our is, and that December was a lot colder, because it contained what we'd call early January (which is when Christmas was).This whole amusing situation lasted until 1752, when Britain finally capitulated and joined the Gregorian Catholics. That in turn really pissed off our colonists in North America, and caused the American revolution.Well, not quite. But it was a small contributing factor. America was a lot more puritan and anti-catholic that Britain was. So if you were a Puritan farmer in Massachusetts, and you were already annoyed about being ruled by people thousands of miles away, forcing silly laws on you without so much as a 'by your leave', then it didn't help. And it was, for years, a contentious bone.And the Russian Orthodox Church is still on the Julian calendar, which is why they have their Christmas in what we call January. This even caused some kerfuffle in Ukraine, with people undecided about whether to use the Western date or the Russian (boo!) one.Midsummer Night's Dream actually takes place on the night of April 30/May 1st. When Theseus finds the young lovers he says:No doubt they rose up early to observeThe rite of May, and hearing our intent,Came here in grace of our solemnity.And today is the day. Today is Mayday. And the distress call MAYDAY! MAYDAY! MAYDAY! is just the French way of saying 'Help me!'M'AIDEZ! M'AIDEZ! M'AIDEZ!The Inky Fool responds to the fuel crisis.P.S. Obviously this could all have been solved if we'd just used Stone Henge, which marks the solar year. So, really, the English were right all along."},

In English the word illustration came first, and it meant to teach by means of examples, shedding light upon an abstract subject. The Illustrated Etymologicon is therefore both illuminating and illuminated, enlightening and enlightened. It is, if you like, an illuminated manuscript. The book is available in most English speaking territories, and in the lost former colony of the USA it can still be obtained by ordering it from The Book Depository.Incidentally, the mini in miniature has nothing whatsoever to do with the mini in minute or minimum or miniskirt. In Medieval illuminated manuscripts there were little pictures painted by little monks. These pictures were often painted using red lead or minium. Because of that the verb for painting little pictures was miniare. And because of that the little pictures were called miniatures.

The book's a little dry, but it's beautifully short. The etymology, by the way is Greek. Pan means everything, as in a pandemic which is a disease that has spread to all the people. The demic there is the same as democracy, which is government by the people. The callism bit comes from kalos, which meant beautiful and is the same root that you get when looking a pretty things in a kaleidoscope, or admiring somebody who is callipygian.Since you ask, callipygian means possessing a beautiful bottom, and is also a very useful word to use on your internet dating profile, I expect.The Inky Fool discussing Medieval aesthetics. P.S.

The event is celebrated by lexicographers everywhere because it gave the English language two new terms: flying saucer and pelicanist.Kenneth Arnold was a businessman and aviator who, on June 24th 1947, saw nine thingummybobs flying past Mount Ranier in Washington State at over a thousand miles an hour. Or, he says he saw them. This blog post will not answer the great question as to whether extraterrestrial life visits earth, because, though I know the answer, I'm not telling.The question as to who first called these thingummybobs flying saucers is rather vexed. Kenneth Arnold says that he didn't use the term, that he only said that the motion of their flight resembled a saucer being skipped across the surface of a lake. However, there was a journalist who insisted that Arnold said the objects looked like saucers, and the term could have been invented by any of a hundred headline writers who wrote about the Great Event.(Incidentally, I have skipped a lot of stones across lakes, but never a saucer.

{"title": "Shires, Counties, Counts and Sheriffs", "date": "Tuesday 27 April 2021", "text": "The nomenclature of England is a foggy thing, cunningly designed to confuse foreigners, who will wonder, in their simple foreign way, why they're consuming a Devonshire cream tea in Devon, why an earl's wife is a countess, why Nottingham had a sheriff, and why the Welsh Marches rather than march.Thank God that I'm an Englishman, and was therefore born confused, rather than having to become so, like a mere Frenchman.The explanation though is reasonably simple. Once upon an Old English time there were shires: Hampshire, Wiltshire, Nottinghamshire etc. The Anglo-Saxons lived in these and kept the Hobbit population under control. Each shire was ruled for the king by a shire-official, or shire-reeve, or scir-gerefa, or sheriff. That's why there was a Sheriff of Nottingham. He would, in fact, have been sheriff of Nottinghamshire. The Sheriff was therefore an Important Chap, and the Old English word for an Important Chap was an Eorl, or Earl. Then, in 1066, the Normans invaded and Frenchified everything. The Normans like their faluting to be high and their pants to be fancy, so they decided to call Shires by the Latinate word county. The head of a county should of course have been called a Count, but he was already being called an Earl and it was hard to change. Therefore a Norman might consider himself to be the Count of the County around Oxford, but the peasants all called him the Earl of Oxfordshire. The peasants won in the end, because they were speaking English, which is a much better language than all the others.So that's why England has counties but not counts; the counts became earls, because that's what the peasants called them. But the wives of the counts never went near the peasants at all, and that's why they're still called countesses.The wonderful English language had, of course, to be protected from its natural enemies like the Scots who wanted to pronounce every vowel as \"ae\", and the Welsh, who had a language based entirely on cheating at Scrabble. To do this there were particularly militant border counties called Marches. An earl in one of these shires could have called himself the count of the county, but he preferred to sound all military and tough and point out that he ran a march. So he called himself a Marquis and he called his wife a marchioness. A March, by the way, has nothing to do with marching, but it is vaguely related to a bookmark as they both mark your place. Moreover, counts don't count. Earl DraculaN.B. I have slightly simplified history so that it conforms more perfectly to etymology. Truth is far preferable to fact.

{"title": "Apple M[a]cIntosh", "date": "Monday 5 April 2021", "text": "The original logoThere's a website where you can buy an Apple Macintosh for 40p. Well, in fact, you can buy three for £1.20. That amounts to the same thing. Also, it's not really an Apple Macintosh, it's a McIntosh Apple; but the one is named after the other.Back in 1811 a Canadian fellow called John McIntosh started selling a new cultivar of apple, which became known as the McIntosh apple. It is, apparently, a tasty apple. I'm not sure I've ever eaten one but it's one of the top fifteen apple varieties in the United States, so it's got to be all right.Many years later, there was a man called Steve Jobs who ate a lot of fruit. One day, whilst on a fruitarian diet, he visited an apple farm (presumably he was hungry), and decided that \"apple\" would be a good name for the new electonic gizmo and fizzbang company that he was starting. (N.B. There's a myth that it's named after that apple that was found at the scene of the [alleged] suicide of Alan Turing, but that's not true.)Anyway, there was now a company called Apple, named after apples, and it had employees, including a chap called Jef Raskin. Jef Rasking liked apples as well as working for Apple, and his absolute favourite kind of apple was the McIntosh Apple, so he picked it as the name for the new computer they were working on.Unfortunately for Jef there was already a tech company called McIntosh Laboratory Inc, and so they had to alter the spelling, and that is how Mr McIntosh's apple became the Apple Macintosh.Grows on trees."},
{"title": "The Meaning of Pasta", "date": "Wednesday 17 March 2021", "text": "The Italian for a butterfly is a farfalla, and so the pasta that looks like a butterfly is called farfalle. One can think of this as beautiful, or one can think of a plate heaped high with dead butterflies. The choice is yours.It's a lot better than thinking of linguine as a plateful of little tongues, which is rather horrid. Linguine is a diminutive, as is spaghetti. The Italian for string is spago; the diminutive form, the little string, is a spaghetto; and the plural is spaghetti. Vermicelli are little worms. Orrecchiette are severed ears (well, I assume they're severed, as otherwise there'd be a head on the plate). Fettuccine are pleasanter, they're little ribbons. Pasta, of course, is just a paste, a dough. It's the same paste that your find in pastels and pasties and impasto paintings. If you mash up a genre into a paste, you get a pastiche.It can be rather fun to think of linguine al'arrabiata as little tongues in angry sauce, or it can put you right off your meal. As an Englishman, I feel that these Italian secrets should be kept in Italy; they might give me nightmares; so I shall stick to eating good British toad-in-the-hole. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears because I'm hungry."},
{"title": "Omega and Big Charlie", "date": "Monday 15 March 2021", "text": "Tall?Sometimes an etymology is so obvious that I can't believe that I've never noticed it, and I marvel at my own duncedom.The Greek letter omega, as in alpha and omega, was just the big O, the mega-O, O-mega. The shorter O in the Greek alphabet is called called omicron, or small O. I am/was able to recite the whole Greek alphabet, and I had never noticed.Another hidden big is Charlemagne, who wasn't really called Charlemagne. He was just a big Charlie. Well, to be precise he was Carl the Great, that was written in Latin as Carolus Magnus and that ended up as Charlemagne. Big Charlie was the son of Pepin the Short, who is still just known as Pepin the Short. Oddly enough Pepin the Short wasn't actually short; he just had short hair. But that will never change the way I think of him, just as I shall always think of John of Gaunt as a pale, bony man. Pepin the Short's dad was Charles Martel, except he wasn't really. He was called Charles, and he was nicknamed The Hammer, which, in French, is martel. His influence lives on in the work of the modern poet Stanley Kirk Burrell, who is almost universally known as MC Hammer. MC is short for Master of Ceremonies. As as shortening it's first recorded in 1790:It was Tyson's Benefit, and as he is my acquaintance, independent of being M:C:, it was but decent that at least one of us should appear there.Master is a much older word. It goes back to the Old English maegester, which goes back to the Latin magister (literally meaning bigger one), which is cognate with the Greek mega, which is why omega just means Big O.Defeated the Umayyad invasion of AquitaineN.B.

I have long suspected that the only thing I truly grasp is nonsense, now it is fiddlesticks.Violin is the diminutive of viola, and viola come from the Latin vitula which meant stringed instrument, and vitula was named after Vitula, the Goddess of Joy. This is presumably on the basis that playing music makes you joyful, a hypothesis I have disproved by experiment. The Romans, it seems, exported their vitulas to the Old High Germans. The Old High Germans pronounced the V as an F (quite forgivable as they are similar sounds) and also pronounced the T as a D (likewise forgivable), and the result was that they called it a fidula, and the English ended up calling it a fiddle. Anyway, the English started fiddling, moving their hands and fingers around whilst trying to summon back the last screams of the dying cat. The result was the more common verb fiddle meaning to move your hands about pointlessly. So pointless was it all, so very unpointed, that the bows of violins, the fiddlesticks, became by the C17th an exclamation meaning stuff and nonsense, nonsense and stuff. And thus, what was once joy is now fiddlesticks.The Inky Fool throws a party"},
{"title": "Vaccines and Buckaroo", "date": "Friday 5 March 2021", "text": "For some reason unknown to me vaccines have been much in the news of late. It's all the fault of a fellow called Edward Jenner (1749-1823) who had the eccentric idea of preventing smallpox in humans by injecting them with cows, or possibly cowpox. Cowpox is a demure disease, but, once you had got used to it, you could fight off smallpox, which was a dastardly disease.The Latin for cow was vacca, and the Latin name of cowpox is variolae vaccinae. So Dr Jenner called his new invention vaccination, which therefore means something like cowification.The Spanish had a much better idea. Instead of injecting diseased cows into people, they raised cattle, slaughtered them, and then ate them. This is less medically interesting, but much more delicious. The Spanish were so keen on cow-herding that they discovered a new continent called America and filled it with cows. Because Spanish is derived from Latin, the Spanish word for cow was vaca, and the Spanish word for the men who herded cows was vaquero.However, the Spanish can't tell the difference between the letter V and the letter B. So when the North Americans imported the word for their own English-speaking cowboys, they called them buckayros, and later buckaroos. A buckaroo is just a Latinate cowboy. He has nothing to do with a bucking bronco, and everything to do with a vacca.In 1989 Hasbro produced a children's game called Buckaroo! This involves putting things on a plastic mule, but, etymologically, it should really be a cow. This is a film about distressed Wykehamists.P.S. The Spanish word vaqueros also means jeans, as that is what they wore."},

{"title": "Isolation, Insualtion, Islands and Insulin", "date": "Thursday 19 March 2020", "text": "No man is an island, although I confess I am becoming a peninsula.The Latin for island was insula, and something that was almost an island was a peninsula. Therefore when people needed a posh word for turning something into an island (these necessities arise), the English word insulation was invented. Originally, it literally meant turning into an island. In 1854 you could, with a straight face, write:The insulation of peninsulas by the destruction of the isthmus which previously connected them with the mainland.Then insulation started to mean anything that cut something off from the outside, and started to be applied to electricity and central heating. You could also talk about people being insular, if they lived on islands and were a tad unfriendly.In the 19th century there was a German fellow called Paul Langerhans. Paul started cutting people open and discovering things. He discovered the Langerhan cells in the skin, and then the Langerhan layer (also in the skin), and then he looked in the pancreas and found little islands of cells that are called the islets of Langerhans. Then he moved to Madeira, became insular, wrote a guidebook and developed an unhealthy interest in sea worms.Anyhow, the islets of Langerhans also have a technical Latin name: insulae pancreaticae. And the important chemical that they produce is therefore called insulinAll of these words were invented by clever fellows who knew Proper Latin. But in Italy, when the Roman Empire declined and fell, they forgot Proper Latin and started to speak Sloppy Latin or Italian as it is now known.In Sloppy Latin they stopped pronouncing the N in insula and so insulatus became isolato, and the French nicked that and got isolé, and the insular English nicked that and got isolated. Later we decided that this adjective needed a verb and noun so we invented isolate and isolation. These are just the Sloppy Latin version of insulate and insulation.The very odd thing is that none of these words are etymologically related to island. Island isn't Latin at all. It comes from Middle English yland, and that comes from Old English igland. The silent S got added a lot later, presumably in confusion.Anyhow, back in the day (by which I mean Medieval and Early Modern times) whenever a reasonably well-off fellow died, his family would run down to the church with a bit of money and pay to have the bell toll. Other reasonably well-off people would hear this and they would send a servant to see who had gone to join the majority.Which brings us to lovely and lamentable prose of John Donne's Devotions on Emergent Occasions, Meditation XVII:No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as any manner of thy friends or of thine own were; any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind. And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. So go and wash your hands.Paul Langerhans contemplating sea-worms."},

That roll was his role.In Shakespeare's time, when everything was being hand-copied before production, each actor would be given a roll that had only his lines and cues on. So the roll only contained the role, and if you were given a particular roll then...Well, you get the point.And before anybody objects, all Shakespeare's actors were male (apart from the ones that weren't).Incidentally, if anybody is really keen on loo roll, you should read Bum Fodder: An Absorbing History of Toilet Paper by Richard Smyth.

{"title": "Pangolins and Idle Orangutans", "date": "Friday 13 March 2020", "text": "I was sautéing some pangolin the other day, when it occurred to me that there are several Malay animals in the menagerie of etymology. (It also occurred to me that the I was filled with a vast apocalyptic dread as to how to spell sautéing).Pangolin comes from the Malay pen-goling, which means the roller. This is because of the pangolin's endearing habit of rolling up into a scaly ball when it's frightened, and nothing to do with the delicious twizzlers you can make out of its rump.Gecko is Malay, and is said to be imitative of that creature's cry. Anybody who has heard the melancholy cry of the distant gecko wandering in moonlit woods, mourning his lost love, will know the sound of true sadness. I have not.Cockatoo means elder sibling. I don't know why. I have an elder sister, but she is featherless, to my knowledge.Orangutan is Malay for man of the forest. Orang is man and hutan is forest. The name was recorded by a Dutch explorer called Jacobus Bontius in 1611. The locals told him that the orangutan was actually able to talk, but preferred not to, in case somebody asked it to do some work. This seems perfectly sensible to me, and nobody has proved otherwise.Some historians even think that the orangutan recorded by Bontius wasn't an ape at all, but a a tribe of unfriendly and idle forest-dwellers. Some historians have no sense of fun.The important thing about these animals - the pangolin, the gecko, the cockatoo, and the orangutan - is that, when you put them all together, you find that you have a delicious casserole.I recommend panic-buying tins of all of them.Incidentally, the Germans have a lovely word for panic-buying: hamsterkauf. Kauf means shopping and hamster means just what you think it does. The idea is that hamsters store food in their little cheeks, and that panic-buyers are doing something equally sweet.Panic not, though, dear reader. If you're wondering what it's like to sit all alone for weeks at a time with only a tin of soup to tell your troubles to; I can report that it's not that bad. I've been doing it for years.

{"title": "Macbeth, Pilate and the Washing of Hands", "date": "Tuesday 10 March 2020", "text": "There has been much chitter and chatter of late about the washing of hands. A central question is what you should sing or recite to yourself while you do it. This is all down to a little virus that encases itself in a protective layer of fat, fat that is destroyed by twenty seconds contact with soap. Thus the virus may be killed (rather than washed off).Nobody seems to have suggested the very obvious, greatest hand-washing speech in literature. Lady Macbeth:Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why, then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?--Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him.The way I read that, it's almost exactly twenty seconds. Of course, Lady Macbeth only believes that she's washing her hands as she's mad and haunted by guilt, but most of modern Britain is too, or so I hear.You could also take her husbands earlier hand-washing efforts, when he's still got the king's blood on his hands.Whence is that knocking?How is't with me, when every noise appals me?What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this bloodClean from my hand? No, this my hand will ratherThe multitudinous seas incarnadine,Making the green one red.That's also pretty much bang on twenty seconds. Incarnadine, by the way, is a verb meaning to make bloody.Oddly enough, the term red-handed, as in caught red-handed. Comes from medieval Scottish law, presumably on the basis that a murderer caught red-handed still has blood on his (or her) hands.The other great hand-washing scene is altogether too short. Pontius Pilate in Matthew, chapter 27:When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.Apparently, in France Camus' novel The Plague has been selling rather well.

{"title": "Diners, Restaurants, Automats and Flats", "date": "Tuesday 3 March 2020", "text": "I've been asked (in this twittering world), about the difference between diners and restaurants. The distinction is simple, diners come from trains.Originally, in 1890, the diner was the carriage of a railway train where food was served. It was what we would now probably call the dining car (that's what Johnny Cash called it in Folsom Prison Blues), or in Britain the buffet car (because you're buffeted by nastiness and expense). The way that the old-style dining car worked was that there was a counter down one side of the carriage, behind which was a grill etc; on the other side there were tables for the passengers to sit at and munch.This proved an important point: it proved that it was possible to make a restaurant so thin that it could be transported by rail, or even by road. This meant that diner-like restaurants could be prefabricated* and then driven to wherever they were needed. As diners are mainly needed beside roads to serve hungry motorists, this led to a lot of business and a lot of burgers.The original diners, therefore, were long and thin and looked rather like railway carriages, because they were built to be transported by road. Here's a picture of a typical diner from 1941:Diners could be dumped anywhere. By coincidence I was reading a James Thurber short story the other day that has a husband and wife driving along and arguing about which diner to stop at:'I think I know the one you mean,' she said, after a moment. 'It's right in the town and it sits at an angle from the road. They're never so good, for some reason.'The husband explodes in angry hunger. She continues:'I've noticed the ones that sit at an angle. They're cheaper, because they fitted them into funny little pieces of ground. The big ones parallel to the road are best.'And she was probably right.The diner is therefore a transportable form of the restaurant. A restaurant restores you. That's because it sells restoratives. It all derives from soup and Parisian law.There was a Frenchman called Boulanger and in 1765 he opened a little place beside the Louvre that sold soup. The soup was of the bouillon style that we would normally call consommé, but the standard French term of the time was to call it a restorative or restaurant. Boulanger even put up a sign in the window saying:Venite ad me omnes qui stomacho laboratis et ego vos restauraboWhich is a sort of parody of the Sermon on the Mount. It means Come to me all whose stomachs are distressed, and I will restore you.So far, so very normal. What was odd about all this was simply that Boulanger also served leg of lamb, and that was illegal. Only members of the caterers' guild were allowed to serve cooked solids, it seems, so the caterers' guild sued Boulanger.To everybody's surprise, they lost. I don't know the reason. I know nothing of Parisian bylaws of the C18th and I'm not about to start studying them. As far as I can tell, though, this created a legal precedent for a new kind of eating establishment outside of guild control. These new establishments became known as restaurants.Finally, as this post has been going on a long while now, there's the automat. I never realised that an automat was a kind of American restaurant until I watched the film Easy Living recently. Essentially, an automat was a self-service place. There were lots of meals but they were kept behind glass in little boxes. You had to insert some coins to open the window. Then you took your food to the table to eat. Here's one of the automat scenes from Easy Living:It was the cheap and cheerful place for a hard-up New York girl to go and get a bite to eat. And that goes to explain the line in Diamonds are a Girl's Best FriendA kiss may be grand but it won't pay the rentalOn your humble flat, or help you at the automatMen grow cold as girls grow oldAnd we all lose our charms in the endBut square cut or pear shapedThese rocks don't lose their shapeDiamonds are a girl's best friend.A single line therefore contains an incomprehensible Americanism - automat - and a Britishism - humble flat - where the Americans would usually say apartment. That's probably because the song was co-written by Leo Robin (American) and Jule Styne (British).Mind you, the fully British Flanders and Swann wrote the lines:When they whispered Napoleon paid Josephine's rent\"That's nonsense,\" said Bonaparte.\"She lives on her own, apart.In her own apart-Ment\"*Like a sprout.P.S. The ever-excellent 99% Invisible did an episode on automats. You can read or hear it here.P.P.S. I thoroughly recommend Easy Living, or any film with Carole Lombard. My Man Godfrey is the best, but Easy Living, it seems, is on Youtube.P.P.P.S. I wouldn't normally recommend that, but you can't buy the DVD for some reason.P.P.P.P.S. The Thurber story, since you ask, was called A Couple of Hamburgers."},
{"title": "Quarantine Comes Home", "date": "Tuesday 25 February 2020", "text": "Quarantine just means forty. It's a shortening of the Italian phrase quarantina giorni, which meant (and means) forty days. This was because of a policy implemented by the Most Serene Republic of Venice to protect itself from the plague. Any ship that was suspected of possibly having the plague on board would have to wait offshore for forty days before docking. The idea was that any hidden cases would present themselves.Presumably, if the plague was on board then everybody was in a lot of trouble. I suppose that they just sailed back to where they had come from. An alternative was that suspect people could stay on a small island to see just how plaguey they were. The island was known as a lazaretto.In Venice the Lazaretto Vecchio still exists. It's a small island just off the Lido. I'm not sure whether you can visit it, or whether you'd want to. Archaeologists have found 1,500 skeletons there so far, and they're rather hopeful that there are some more.The word lazaretto as a place for the plagued comes from Luke's Gospel, chapter 16:There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. It turns out that Lazarus goes to Heaven and the rich man goes to Hell. History does not relate what happened to the dog. Or, to put it another way, God knows what happened to the dog.Anyway, you should have been able to work out that God would help Lazarus in the end, as Lazarus comes from the Hebrew El'azar, which means He whom God has helped. It's rather odd really, as Lazarus became, in many European languages a synonym for leper or plague-victim, which seems unhelpful even by God's standards.Oddly enough, when quarantine first appeared in the English language, it had nothing to do with plague. It was the place where Jesus fasted for forty days and forty nights. It first pops up in a travel guide for pilgrims to the Holy Land written in 1470:Beyond is a wilderness of quarantine, where Christ with fasting his body did pine.Although the author, William Wey had got to Jerusalem via Venice, so he might have picked up the word there.Today we remember Christ fasting and pining by giving stuff up for Lent. Pancake day is today and Lent begins tomorrow. I shall abstain from rhubarb and women, for the sake of continuity; but an old word for Lent was - you have guessed it, dear reader - quarantine. Forty days of fasting.Then quarantine started to mean the period of forty days that a widow was allowed to remain living in her dead husband's house. And finally, in the seventeenth century we started using it for its proper purpose of plague. However, the word had already become rather imprecise. The second citation in the OED is from Samuel Pepys' diary in 1663, where he suddenly veers off into etymology:The plague, it seems, grows more and more at Amsterdam; and we are going upon making of all ships coming from thence and Hambrough, or any other infected places, to perform their Quarantine (for thirty days as Sir Rd. Browne expressed it in the order of the Council, contrary to the import of the word, though in the general acceptation it signifies now the thing, not the time spent in doing it) in Holehaven, a thing never done by us before.But the original quarantine, first enforced in 1377, was Venetian. And so, by such divigations and tergiversations, quarantine has finally come home.Enjoy your pancakes while you can. Quarantine begins tomorrow.The Inky Fool arrives at his Venetian hotel"},

{"title": "The Taxman and the Farmer", "date": "Friday 31 January 2020", "text": "Today I have been paying the farmer. Because farmers aren't farmers, they're tax-gatherers.Some people have trade surnames: Mr Baker, Mr Butcher, Mr Farmer etc. And these people happily imagine that in some way off medieval time they had an ancestor who was a baker or a butcher or a farmer. The first two are right, but the Farmers are wrong. Because a farmer is a taxman. Or was.The name has nothing to do with farms.Once upon a time, there was the Medieval Latin word firma, which meant a fixed [payment]. (It's related in this to firm, firmament, affirm etc). From this you got the Old French fermier and the English farmer all meaning tax collector, or one who collects a fixed payment.So Chaucer wrote (with his mind on the taxman):Him ought not be... cruel As is a farmer to do the harm he can.This meaning of farmer actually survived all the way to the C19th, although by that time it had become rather odd.But, feudally, rich landowners used to collect taxes on the land they owned, and they would have middle-men who were responsible for collecting the tax from a particular area. These tax farmers were responsible for a single farm from a single piece of land. They often had responsibility for making sure that it was cultivated its most profitable extent. Often they lived there as a tenant farmer.People these days buy time-share apartments, which are often just referred to as time-shares. In the same way, the method of payment slowly came to be associated with the activity of agriculture. So the old words husbandman and churl were slowly replaced. And by the late C16th, farmer had become the standard word for somebody who simply owned a farm.But the surname dates from the C13th. And that's why I've been paying the farmer.P.S. Terra Firma is not, I'm afraid, related. It was originally the Venetian holding on the mainland.P.P.S. This is a repost from 2015."},
{"title": "Hypocrites and Horse-Power", "date": "Monday 27 January 2020", "text": "The English word hypocrite has a terribly simple etymology. It comes straight from the Ancient Greek hypokrites, which means actor, the kind you get on a stage, because hypocrites act all pious.I was wondering what extra formations this might produce e.g. a fear of actors, if there is such a thing, ought to be hypocritephobia. And then a strange thought occurred to me: Hippocrates.Hippocrates was the Father of Medicine. It is from him that we get the Hippocratic oath that doctors have to swear. Of course, it's got nothing to do with hypocrites. The hippo there is usually a horse - that's why a hippopotamus is a river-horse and a horse-racing arena is a hippodrome. And crat is usually power as in plutocrat, aristocrat, theocrat etc.So, I thought, if my calculations are correct, Hippocrates was really Dr Horsepower.This seemed hideously unlikely. But I have a cheat for all things classical. My next-door neighbour is a professor emeritus of classics. This is terribly useful to me as I get to pass off his wisdom as my own. So yesterday I seized m neighbour by the buttonhole and asked him straight out: Does Hippocrates mean horsepower?'I don't see why not,' he replied. 'Yes. Go for it.'Too good to be true.'Although,' he added, 'it's more likely to mean horse-controller. But it could mean horsepower. Greek, Mark, is a very flexible language.'So there it is: Hippocrates, Father of Medicine, was really Dr Horsepower.Incidentally, the bit of the brain called the hippocampus is not, as is usually believed, a university for hippos. In fact, it's named after the seahorse because it sort-of-vaguely resembles one.Hippo is horse and kampos means sea-monster. The original hippocampus was a horse-sea-monster that drew Neptune's chariot across the waves. Here is a rare photograph:The Inky Fool decides not to take the train"},

Luckily for all of us, it will be over in a few days, and we may return to our restful cakes and our crumpets of calm.Originally, exercise was something that Romans did to horses (and soldiers). It was too cruel for proper people. Most of the time horses (and soldiers) were kept penned up so that they couldn't run away. The Latin word for penning up or enclosing was arcere. Occasionally, they would be let out to go and canter freely in the paddock or take up horsey-pilates or whatever it was. To do this was to ex-arcere them, and from that you got exercere, and modern exercise.The word arcere also gave us the adjective arcane, because arcane knowledge is knowledge that is enclosed and shut away and locked up in a big box. Indeed, arcere itself comes from the noun arca which means box or chest or ark.The Ark of the Covenant was simply a very fancy chest. We refer to it as an ark because the Latin Bible called it an arca. The Ten Commandments contained therein were therefore the original arcane knowledge. And when, as it saith in the book of Indiana Jones, all those spirits jumped out and killed the nasty Nazis, they were simply exercising.The Inky Fool's filing system was becoming ever more efficient."},

{"title": "Opinion Polls and Tadpoles", "date": "Tuesday 10 December 2019", "text": "The question 'Who's ahead in the polls?' is a delicious and savoury pun, because a poll is a head. Or it was. Shakespeare used poll to mean a head and it was still going strong in the C19th. But now it's mainly used about horses.Nonetheless a poll was a head and from this you get:Tadpoles - which are literally toad-heads. Little heads swimming around waiting to grow their bodies.Poleaxe - an axe with a specialised and rather brutal looking head. See the illustration.Poll tax - a tax per person. Think of it like a head-count, or the phrase 'a hundred head of cattle' (try not to think of poleaxes at the same time).Polling station/booth/going to the polls etc - This gives you the head count of an entire nation.Opinion poll - a headcount of people's opinionsStraw poll - Nobody's quite sure about this one. It's either a poll that is so weak that it may as well have been made of straw. Or it derives from the practice of throwing some straw in the air to see which way the wind is blowing. As Bob Dylan correctly observed \"You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows\". You do not. You need straw.Sometimes the poll was just the top of the head, just the bit that your hair grows out of. From this you got the sense of a poll as a haircut. (\"Nice poll.\" \"Oh, do you like it? Thank you.\"). So, in Hamlet, Ophelia sings:He never will come again.His beard was as white as snow,All flaxen was his poll:He is gone, he is gone...This meaning was still around when D.H. Lawrence wrote Sons and Lovers in 1913:The child—cropped like a sheep, with such an odd round poll.This is because a poll was usually a short, even haircut. And from that you get poll as a verb, meaning to cut short and evenly. If you do that to a tree, then the tree has been pollarded.Moreover, the paper on which a legal deed is written can be cut evenly at the bottom, in which case poll becomes a postpositive adjective (like attorney general, or astronomer royal) and the legal deed is a deed poll.But the two most important variants of poll are doddypoll, which is an old word for an idiot, and poll-sickness, which was helpfully defined in 1899:Poll-sickness..is a kind of sore or abscess which horses get from knocking their heads against low door-ways and is commonly supposed to be incurable.I fear it is.Two doddypolls arguing about the polls with poleaxesP.S.

{"title": "Covers, Discoveries, Handkerchiefs and Curfews", "date": "Thursday 5 December 2019", "text": "I have been considering the word cover. This is partly because The Etymologicon, The Horologicon and The Elements of Eloquence have been reprinted in a beautiful new edition, just in time for Christmas; and partly because I am an extraordinarily dull and lonely fellow.I also have a cold, which is putting great strain on my collection of handkerchiefs. Now a handkerchief is obviously a kerchief that you hold in your hand. That much is obvious. But it leaves the throbbing question of What is a kerchief?Well a chief is a head. That's true in English, is true in French (where the head cook is the chef), and it was true in medieval French where your chief was your head. If, for some French reason, you wished to cover your chief you used a piece of cloth called a cover-chief or, in French a couvrechief.This was what we would call a headscarf, but that's just a square of cloth really. So a couvrechief came into English as a kerchief and hence a handkerchief is, literally, a handheld-cover-head. But I employ mine to blow my nose.(Incidentally, the more obscure word for blowing your nose is emunction. This may come in useful. 'Tis the season and all that. The Anglo-Saxon word for the practice was sniting, but I digress down needless nostrils).The other thing that Medieval French people liked to cover were their fires. They did this at the end of the day to make the fire burn down to a smoulder. Then they would toddle off to bed. In the morning, they would stir the fire up to a blaze and have a nice French breakfast.In French this was called the couvre-feu, or cover-fire. There used to be a bell that was rung to tell everybody that it was time to cover their fire and go to bed. This tolling bell became known in English as the curfew. And hence a curfew is any requirement to go to bed, whether ding-donged or not.[A foolish error has been removed. See below]Anyway, the word cover has various other meanings and variations of varying mysteriousness. You can cover more ground by moving fast, you can cover for a colleague, a journalist can cover a subject (presumably in ink), and a gunman can have you covered. No amount of research has explained to me why a cover version is called that. But my favourite cover lingers in plain sight. It is the word discover.To dis-cover something is to remove its cover. Once upon a time this could be used for anything. So a strong wind could discover a house, i.e. blow its roof off. A chef could discover a bowl. One could discover one's Christmas presents by unwrapping them. It is the sense of something that was once covered having its cover removed. This is rather beautiful when you think about it in its modern sense. The discovery of America, for example, suggests that there was a whole veiled continent , until Mr Columbus pulled the curtain away and discovered it.You should not discover these books.I've removed a digression that I made on the subject of being \"in full swing\", for the simple reason that I was wrong. I looked at the OED entry for \"full swing\", but hadn't noticed that they had another for \"in full swing\" that takes the phrase back to 1570 with no mention of bells.(Incidentally, a church bell turns on an axle. If it's being rung in a slow dong... dong... dong... then that requires the bell-ringer to balance the bell at the the top of its turn in order to get the pause. The alternative is to let ring the bells like crazy and let them do their full swing. Hence the phrase in full swing. It's a bellringer's term*).*The OED only has it from 1843 without any bells. But I found an \"in full swing\" from 1802: \"The bell being in full swing, no alteration whatever was perceptible. The instant that the clapper was loosed the mercury leaped up, and continued that sort of springing motion, at every stroke of the clapper\"."},
{"title": "The Origin of the Christmas Tree", "date": "Friday 29 November 2019", "text": "You are probably about to buy a dead tree and put it up in your living room. This is, if you ponder it, odd behaviour on your part. What's odder is that the tree you're buying is the Tree of Knowledge that was planted in the Garden of Eden and brought sin into the world, and the baubles you'll hang on it are the forbidden fruit. But the explanation is pretty simple.Adam and Eve were a lot more popular in Medieval Christianity than they are today. There were even quite a lot of continuation stories - The Further Adventures of Adam and Eve, as it were - which was pretty common practice before the Reformation. The First Couple were even treated as semi-saints. They had a name-day like proper saints do, and that name day was December 24th.This made a lot of sense theologically. Adam (via Eve) brought sin into the world, and Jesus (via Mary) brought salvation from sin. So the fall of man and the birth of Christ were a natural pairing, like blue cheese and sherry.What Medieval people liked to do to celebrate religious events was to put on plays. Am-dram is fun, and it was a good way to tell a Bible story to a population that mostly couldn't read. Bible plays got so popular that in 1210 the Pope had to actually issue and edict banning priests from acting on stage as it was starting to look undignified.Adam and Eve were a popular subject, so popular that \"Paradise Plays\" about the Garden of Eden was a whole sub-genre of the religious theatre. And very often they would be acted on Adam and Eve's name day: December 24th.The set would be pretty minimalist, but if you're going to put on a play about people picking an apple from a tree and eating it, you do absolutely need to have a tree.And they did. There's even a description of one in the script of a paradise play called Le Jeu d'Adam performed in Arras in Northern France (this is very lucky for historians as usually medieval play-scripts don't have stage directions).Then shall a serpent, cunningly contrived, climb up the trunk of the forbidden tree; Eve shall put her ear up to it as if listening to its advice. Then Eve shall take the apple and offer it to Adam.But, of course, trees are hard to come by in late December, and fruit trees are all leafless and bare. So the only solution was to cut down an evergreen, bring it indoors on Christmas Eve and hang it with fake fruit. This may sound familiar. That's what you're about to do. That's what your Christmas tree is: it's the Tree of Knowledge hung with the forbidden fruit.There are records of paradise plays still being performed on Christmas Eve right into the 19th century, though they were very rare. There are even some parts of Germany where the Christmas tree is still called the paradeisbaum, though tannenbaum is now much more common.All that remained was for Prince Albert and the royal family to make the Tree of Knowledge popular in Britain, which they did via a famous illustration in the Illustrated London News in 1848.But this leaves two questions:1) Who played the snake? It seems that somebody must have stood behind the tree with a long sock of something over their arm, tempting dear old Eve. It must have looked a little like the muppets.2) At the beginning of the play, were Adam and Eve naked? And how can we obtain tickets? The disappointing answer is No. That same play, the Jeu d'Adam, has also has this stage direction:Adam shall wear a red tunic, but Eve a woman's garment in white with a white silk scarf.Thus making the plays utterly historically inaccurate.All of the above (with some extra facts) and many many more explanations of Christmas traditions can be found in my book A Christmas Cornucopia: the hidden stories behind our Yuletide traditions, published by Penguin. It's filled with stories that allow you to be insufferably know-it-all about everything from now until the end of December.It can be bought in all good bookshops or from Amazon here.Also, Raymond Briggs said it was \"Blooming brilliant!\", which made me very proud."},
{"title": "Fatal Nostalgia", "date": "Thursday 28 November 2019", "text": "Nostalgia was once a very serious disease. It could be fatal, especially to the Swiss.Nostalgia is a Greek term and literally translates as home-sickness: nostos + algia. Indeed, the two terms are first recorded in English in the same sentence written in 1756. Before that it was unknown in Britain.At least it is thus Scheuchzer endeavours to vindicate the nostalgia, pathopatridalgia, or the heimweh, i.e. home-sickness, with which those of Bern are especially afflicted.Heimweh is German for the same thing and pathoptridalgia is, so far as I can tell, just disease-homeland-disease. The term had been around before, you see, but only in German, because only Swiss people ever suffered from homesickness. The rest of the world was fine and dandy, but the Swiss yearned for watches and fondue, fell ill and died.It was a serious problem, first identified by a Swiss scholar at the University of Basel in 1688. And importantly it was considered not a light and fluffy emotion, but a real and serious disease; albeit one that only Swiss people could catch.But then it spread beyond those neutral borders. People started to suffer from it in Britain, where, again, it was treated as a serious medical condition. The great botanist Joseph Banks whilst sailing around the South Seas in 1770 noted that the ship's crew had a case of \"the longing for home which the Physicians have gone so far as to esteem a disease under the name of Nostalgia.\"It crossed the Atlantic to America, where it took an active and serious role in the Civil War. An official report by the US Sanitary Commission recorded that:In the first two years of the war, there were reported 2588 cases of nostalgia, and 13 deaths from this cause. These numbers scarcely express the real extent to which nostalgia influenced the sickness and mortality of the army. To the depressing influence of home-sickness must be attributed the fatal result in many cases which might otherwise have terminated favorably.And that was just on the Union side.It could get even worse, though. The Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine (1835) has an entry for Nostomania \"the same morbid desire aggravated to madness\", and hence, of course, there were nostomaniacs.And then as strangely as it had arisen, it petered out. As with so many once-serious psychological terms - neurosis, narcissism, hysteria - it became just a feeling, a vague longing for what has gone before, a sentiment, a whimsy; felt for a moment and then blown away by a pufflet of wind.Perhaps, we decided that home simply wasn't as we remembered it. The other English term that comes from nostos is nostos. It's a usually literary term to describe a homecoming scene. Usually it's Odysseus' return home to Ithaca, where he finds all the suitors drinking his wine and wooing his wife. But it can also apply to other homecomings, other nostoi, usually miserable, like Agamemnon and Bilbo Baggins.And nobody dies of it any more, not even the Swiss.O true apothecary, thy drugs are quick."},
{"title": "Unimportant Huckleberries", "date": "Tuesday 26 November 2019", "text": "I was listening to Moon River and noticed the lines:Waiting round the bendMy huckleberry friendAnd it occurred to me that I didn't know what a huckleberry was. The word, it turns out, has several meanings, one of which, astonishingly, is a kind of berry. But it also means, and has meant since 1835, a person of little consequence. Somebody unimportant.This seems rather important to the naming of Mark Twain's character: Person of Little Consequence Finn, star of two books. Nobody seems to mention it.Even the one essay on how Twain named the character - Huckleberries and Humans: On the naming of Huckleberry Finn - doesn't seem to mention it*. Instead, it suggests that the name comes from the fact that huckleberries, that's to say plants of the species Gaylussacia, can't be domesticated.It also occurs to me that Huckleberry Finn obeys my rule that characters names should be half very boring and half very interesting: Huckleberry Finn, Indiana Jones, David Copperfield, Luke Skywalker, which I wrote about in an old blog post here.There is another meaning of Huckleberry, though. As of the 1930s, it could mean sweetheart. So, I would imagine that the huckleberry friend, is just that.All of these meanings, of course, are rural and Southern, but that fits with the fact that Audrey Hepburn is meant to be a secret hick.*Well, the abstract doesn't mention it at all.

Well, rude compound words to be precise, but they're still very rude. If you are an infant or heavily pregnant, or lightly pregnant, or if you are easily offended (as so many are in these offended times) you should stop reading now, leave the Internet, and go and sit beneath a sycamore tree and weep at what the world has come to. Otherwise, read on.Still here?I was once driving in Wiltshire, doing just a smidgen over the speed-limit (which was 50mph, as I recall) and being tailgated at a distance of, I would estimate, two or three inches. It was remarkably dangerous as I couldn't even have dabbed the brakes without causing an accident. One of the other chaps in the car referred to the driver behind us as a \"fucking knob-jockey\".I like this term. It amused me. But I did not at the time think that much about its structure.Sometime later, I came across the term \"cock-womble\", this also amused me, but I did not think that much about its structure.Lately, clever people have started thinking about such phrases, and a new technical term has emerged, and I mean technical, it's the term that you use in academic papers and the like. The term is Shitgibbon. A shitgibbon is formed when you take a one-syllable rude word, be it shit, fuck, cock or whatever, and then add a non-offensive trochee. A trochee is a two-syllable word with the stress on the first syllable. The resulting compound - knob-jockey, cock-womble or etc - is a shitgibbon.The shitgibbon is the subject of a recent paper entitled Vowel but not consonant identity and the very informal English lexicon, which was written by Anne-Michelle Tessier and Michael Becker ofSimon Fraser University and University of Michigan and Stony Brook University. And these two have thought a lot about the shitgibbon's structure.You can read the whole thing here. But the big point that I had never noticed was that a shitgibbon works best when the vowel of the rude word is the same as the first vowel of the trochee.Shit-gibbon has two short i's.it ibShit-monkey doesn't, and doesn't sound nearly as good.Knob-jockey has two O'sSo does cock-womble.Meanwhile, dick-womble, doesn't sound nearly as good.The paper's authors did an awful lot of research, which you can read in the original paper. They did surveys asking people how funny and satisfying any particular shitgibbon was and the compared it to a null hypothesis etc etc etc etc.What's weird is that alliteration had no effect. Only assonance makes a shitgibbon work.So, if you want to make your own shitgibbon (I now feel like a degenerate Blue Peter presenter), just pick a rude word. Identify the vowel. Then pick a trochee that has that vowel in the first syllable. Et voila:Turd-burglar.I cannot quite tell what the gibbon on the right is holding, but I hope it's fruit."},
{"title": "Cosmic Cosmetics and Una Borrachera Cósmica", "date": "Monday 30 September 2019", "text": "The ancient Greeks had the peculiar idea that the universe was very well ordered. How they came to this conclusion is unclear, but it involves Pythagoras and togas. Anyway, they therefore called the universe the kosmos because kosmos just meant orderly arrangement.From that we get cosmos in English, and from that we get cosmic, which (to some extent) has now come to mean spiritual and airy-fairy. This is a bit odd, because when the word kosmos comes up in the New Testament it means the physical world, as opposed to heaven and the kingdom of God etc.Anyway, in their occasional breaks from philosophising the Greeks would do what normal people do and try and look nice. For example, they would comb their hair, which they called kosmokomes or hair-ordering. And the whole art of looking good was called kosmetike. It's a contraction of kosmo-tekhne, so etymologically it's cosmos-technique, but in English it has simply become cosmetics.Which is why your lipstick is cosmic.All this occurs to me because my book A Short History of Drunkenness has been renamed Una Borrachera Cósmica for its release in Spain, an earth-wobbling event that will occur on Thursday. I think there's also going to be an interview with me in El Mundo on Tuesday. It's all very pleasing because I've been learning Spanish for nearly two years now, but I still don't quite understand the name-change, but a Madrileña friend of mine says it's a splendid name, and tried to explain it all to me over a tinto de verano last month.Anyhow, you can learn lots more about Una Borrachera Cósmica by following this link. And you can also (and really should) tell all your Spanish friends and relations about it."},
{"title": "The Real Inky Fool", "date": "Tuesday 6 August 2019", "text": "I had a friend called Andrea who couldn’t go within fifty yards of a fountain pen without getting ink all over her fingers. She’d wipe her fingers on her face and then I would call her the Inky Fool.Ten years ago, Andrea had an idea for a blog about the English language that we could write together. It was all her idea and we named the blog after her: Inky Fool. Back then she wrote as Mrs Malaprop and I as Dogberry. Andrea had a full-time job and I didn’t, so gradually she stopped posting and I continued, always under her watching eye.The blog became popular and then it became famous and then I got a deal to write The Etymologicon. I wrote it, Andrea read all the proofs. She did that for all my books. When it was first published the name on the cover wasMARK FORSYTH (THE INKY FOOL). But I was never the Inky Fool. The Inky Fool was always Andrea.Here is a picture of us at the book launch for The Etymologicon. She was so kind and so clever, and she was my dearest friend, and she died on the seventh of July from auto-immune hepatitis. It’s a cruel disease and it isn’t studied enough. Please, if you have ever enjoyed any of my books or my blog, give a little something to the fund set up in her memory to study the disease. It doesn’t matter how little. https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/andreacolvile"},

This latter seems (merely seems) to be down to the idea that in certain games, if your score ends up as a Schnapszahl, you have to buy everybody a schnapps.This explanation seems convincing to me, if only because of the Nelson in cricket: which is the idea that it's very bad luck to be on a score of 111 (or, indeed, 222) if you make it that far. This bad luck can only be remedied by raising one leg off the ground, obviously.Anyhow, this post seemed a lot more interesting last night.By the way, I am going to Kerala (etymology uncertain, but probably to do with coconuts) next week to speak at the Mathrubhumi International Festival of Letters.

It's therefore terribly useful to know the word okta, which is the standard unit of measurement of cloud cover. It goes from 0 oktas (clear blue sky) to 8 oktas (completely overcast).

Unusually, there is an occasional 9 okta measurement, which means something like too cloudy to see the clouds, although I'm a bit hazy on the subject.It's curious that this should come to mind while I'm staying in the Lake District.In the Lake District all of these are possible simultaneously."},
{"title": "Operating Amphitheatres", "date": "Tuesday 27 November 2018", "text": "When you cut open, it's usually in one of two places: a dark alley, or a theatre; or, to be more precise, an operating theatre. The reason that it's called an operating theatre is quite simple, medical students used to sit in rows and watch. It was a spectator sport to such an extent that it was, until the 1820s just called a theatre without the need of the prefix operating.In 1823, for example, The Lancet reported that:At half-past Seven this Theatre was crowded in every part, by upwards of four hundred Students, of the most respectable description; in fact we never before witnessed so genteel a Surgical class.Which is a pleasant thought for the diseased snob who doesn't want to be cut open by the working classes.A theatre, of course, has two sides that face each other: the stage and the spectators. There can be no spectators behind the stage as, if there were, the actors wouldn't know in which direction to shout. However, if you don't have actors, but instead gladiators or delicious Christians, then you can have the spectators on both sides. This theatre-of-cruelty-in-the-round, where the the audience is 360 degrees instead of 180, is called an amphitheatre. Amphi just means around, or on both sides, and that is the reason that that something that lives (Greek bios) both on land and in water is called an amphibian. It's also the reason that one of those big old wine jars with a handle on both sides is called an amphora.Phora there just means carry, and that is the reason that in Greece today a removals man, who carries your furniture from one place to another, is called a metaphor.We tend to use the word metaphor a little more metaphorically.The Inky Fool spying on his neighbours"},

I find this terribly exciting as I have never been to Ireland before and thus imagine it to be a land of rain and mystery, when in fact it's probably only one of the two.For the record, my favourite Irish-derived word in the English language is slogan. I wrote about it before in 2010, but shall reprint it here.Once upon a time a slogan was a battle-cry. When ancient Gaelic warriors raised their kilts and ran into battle they would shout the name of their tribe or their capital before rushing like wolves to the slaughter. If you imagine the modern football hooligan screaming the name of his club, you probably have some idea.Their army-shouts or sluagh-gairms did not have the desired effect and the English language spread by spear-point and sword into all but the boggiest parts of these rainy islands. Sluagh-gairm was anglicised to slogan and taken up by politicians and plutocrats, cabinet ministers and corporations. Yet, I still like to think of the advertising executives and PR girls girding up their kilts, shrieking their slogans, and running to their brave and selfless deaths.Meanwhile, A Short History of Drunkenness has been sold (the translation rights that is) to about fifteen countries.

{"title": "A Quick Guide to Decoding English Place Names", "date": "Wednesday 24 October 2018", "text": "It's generally quite easy to guess the etymology of an English place name, and quite pleasant too, as you get to sound clever. The system is not in the slightest bit infallible, but it generally works. So long as nobody has The Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names to hand, nobody will be able to contradict you, and that's the important thing.So, here is a quick cheat sheet, and I shall explain at the end why it doesn't always work.ElementsEnglish place names tend to have two elements, perhaps three if they're feeling important. The last element is the important one because it tells you what the place actually was. For example, ton meant farm in Old English. So if the place name ends ton, then way back in the fogs of time it was a farm.The first element is basically an adjective. Often it's just a physical description. So Norton is North Farm.Sutton = South FarmEaston = East FarmWeston = West Farm.Not insanely complex.So, here is a quick and incomplete list of final elements.Borough = FortificationBurn/Bourne = StreamBury = Manor or estate, i.e. a big farmBy = Viking town (that's why they're only in the North in the old Danelaw)Chester/caster/cester = Roman fortCot/coates = CottagesLey/leigh/ly = Clearing in a forestDon = HillDen = Woodland or valley (or, sometimes, a wooded valley)Ham = Home (or sometimes it means land that stretches out into a river)Hurst = Wooded hillIng = Family land (-ing means that the first element is definitely someone's name. It's often compounded to -ington or -ingham or somesuch. So Birmingham is Beorm's family's home)Sea = Island, or a bit of dry ground in the middle of a marshTon = FarmWare = WeirWick/wich = Market. To be more precise wick is a market or a very specialised farm. It means that an industry was concentrated there. Whether Chiswick was a cheese factory or a cheese farm or a cheese market is hard to say. But we do know that Chiswick was cheesy, as was Keswick, and that Gatwick contained many goats.Worth = Enclosure i.e. there was a fence up to keep out the wolves and the Welsh and other furry creatures of the night.First ElementsThe first element is a description.The first element can be physical. I hope that Up- is self-explanatory. Or there's chal/chil, which means cold. Sometimes it refers to a nearby physical feature. Underhill or Exmouth should both be clear, provided you've heard of the river Exe.Often, the first element an animal or a plant. Shepton is obviously a sheep farm. But often the animal can be a little hidden. For example Swin = Swine = Pig. So Swinton is Pig Farm. Houn = Hound = Dog. Craw = Crow. So when you see a first element just wonder vaguely to yourself whether it sounds roughly like a common animal.Musbury, Musgrave, Muscoates and Muston were all infested with mice.The same thing happens with the plants. The Old English for Oak was Ac, so Acton is Oak Farm. Lind is Linden tree (or lime tree as we usually call it). Poplar is poplar.But the main thing to remember about the etymology of English place names is that they're mostly very, very boring, because they are named after people. These are not important people. It's just that once upon a time there was a guy who owned that farm or that clearing or that weir. So people called it after him. And so some Anglo-Saxon lives on forever. This accounts for most place names.Well, to be honest, I've never done a full study. But I just opened the Dictionary of Place Names at a random page and found that of the 22 entries, 11 were called after people, including Chilbolton which was a farm that belonged to Ceolbeald.So, to dash around North London: Finchley is a clearing in a forest (a ley) that was once filled with finches, but Wembley? Well, there isn't any animal or plant that sounds much like Wemb, so you could guess that it was Wemb's clearing, and you'd be pretty much spot on. It was Wemba's clearing, which means that those football supporters who sing about Wemb-a-ley, are etymologically correct.And there you have it. Look at the last element. Ask yourself whether the first element sounds like a plant or an animal or some physical description. Otherwise assume that it's the name of some Anglo-Saxon chap. You'll be right about three quarters of the time.It is time for the destruction of errorI'm afraid that even a medium sized blog post like this cannot make you immediately infallible.You may well be wrong. There are three main reasons for this.1) Sometimes names just change over time for no good reason. There's a place in London called Aldgate. Anybody who knows anything about Old English can tell you that that means Old Gate. But it doesn't. Originally it was called Alegate (beer gate, presumably because beer was sold there). And then in the late Medieval period a D somehow insinuated itself and took up residence.2) What looks like on thing is in fact another. There's a place in London called Brixton, which, using this method would come out as something like Mr Brix's Farm. In fact, the older records have it down as Brigga's Stone.3) Sometimes something completely different comes in. A property developer can think up a nice sounding name. Baron's Court in West London is precisely that. The developer just wanted it to sound as posh as Earl's Court, which is the area next door. Further out, there's Richmond. It's only called that because the Duke of Richmond built a palace there. So really it's named after Richmond in Yorkshire, which is hundreds of miles away. (Since you ask, Richmond in Yorkshire is Rich Mount from the Norman French).The only way to be sure, is to consult a copy of the Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names. The writers of that have gone back to the Doomsday book etc and actually checked. But as very few people carry one around, you can always get away with a bit of specious speculation using the above method. Plus, it makes road signs mildly more interesting.P.S. I've used the term \"English\" here because, obviously, none of this works for a Celtic place name. It would have confused things. The prefix Kil- means calf in English and Church in Celtic. Mind you, there are English place names all over the British Isles, and lots of Celtic place names in England. The Celts survived here, and where they lived the preface is Wal-, which was the Old English word for foreigner.P.P.S. Through all this I'm missing out words that are the same in modern English like Church or Ford or Bridge. You should have worked out what Newton means by now. And if you can't work out what Newcastle is then you're either very silly or very clever.This map should now make sense"},
{"title": "Time is of the Essence or at Large", "date": "Wednesday 12 September 2018", "text": "I've used the phrase time is of the essence all my life without realising that it has a quite precise legal meaning. I just thought that it meant something like get your skates on or show a leg or hurry up. But it is much stronger than that. Time is of the essence because it's essential to the contract.Contracts usually have a deadline in them, but it's not that important. If I have a contract to write a book and I hand it in a month late nobody particularly cares. The world remains quite extraordinarily calm.Some contracts, like building ones have a deadline where the supplier is penalised a bit if they're late. But the contract itself still stands (and has usually taken all this into account).But sometimes the whole contract is based on the deadline, and if the deadlines is missed the contract is null and void. If I'm delivering perishable goods, like milk, to you, and it arrives three weeks late and very sour: then the goods are worthless. The deadline is broken and with it the whole contract. You pay me nothing.A wedding cake that arrives too late is no longer a wedding cake. It is mere cake. The essence of the task, the central part of it, has been destroyed.In cases like this the contract stipulates that time is of the essence, which means that failure to meet the deadline renders the contract defunct.The opposite of time is of the essence is the much rarer, but rather beautiful time at large. Time at large, in a contract, means that the task must be done, but it really doesn't matter when. Take your time. Have cup of tea. Go for a stroll. Wander around like a lazy outlaw who is at large.You can find out more from these two articles on construction contracts.A grand tip of the hat to the Antipodean for pointing this out to me. And for those who like a little light swearing:P.S. For anybody interested.

{"title": "A Measure of Rudeness", "date": "Thursday 6 September 2018", "text": "I've found something beautiful. The British television regulator, Ofcom, whose job it is to see that we are shocked politely, commissioned a study of exactly how rude rude words were. The poll was carried out by Ipsos Mori who went off and quite earnestly asked a representative sample of the Great British public what they thought about the word tits.This is therefore the official British list of naughty words.The results, in all their muddied glory, are available online here. They're rather fascinating, and very usefully arranged by subject. So if you were trying to mildly insult an old man, but couldn't think of anything to say, you could consult the survey and find:Coffin Dodger: Mild language, generally of little concern. Seen as humorous, including by older participants. Some said that more aggression or specific intent to hurt would heighten impact, but not common enough for this to be based on experience.Some of the words in the survey were previously unknown to me. I had never in my life heard of a bloodclaat or a chi-chi man, which shows that I am an essentially innocent person. I'd also not heard the term Iberian Salute, although a quick check on the Internet shows what it is (bend your right elbow, clench your right fist with the knuckles facing away from you, put your left hand on your right bicep. The French call it the bras d'honneur).Anyhow, it's a fascinating read, and you can measure your opinion of a word's rudeness against that of the general public. My favourite line in it, though, came under Discriminatory Language, subsection Race and Ethnicity.Taff: Medium language, potentially unacceptable.

{"title": "Emojis and Emoticons", "date": "Thursday 5 July 2018", "text": "The etymology of emoji ought to be obvious. It's a little digital picture: hence e- like e-mail. And it expresses emotion: hence emo-. Except that that's not it at all.First, the OED mentions that the word dates, in Japanese, back to at least 1928, when computer graphics were not up to much. That also means that it's got little to do with e-things or emo-things. E here means picture in Japanese and moji means character. So it's a pictograph, indeed emoji may have originally been a straight Japanese translation of the English word.Emoji is therefore closely related to Kanji, which is the Japanese writing system that uses Chinese characters. Kan = Chinese and ji = letter. (So far as I can tell moji and ji are the same, but I don't speak a word of Japanese, I am simply relying on the clever people at the OED, who, I suspect, do.)Emoticons, on the other hand, are emotion-icons and have been recorded since 1988. They are therefore utterly unrelated to emojis.And this is from a Japanese picture scroll, or e-makimono, or emaki."},

I considered myself quite precocious in this, and imagined that my parents were proud of me.But now that I am of man's estate, I discover that green cheese isn't green either. It's merely new, unripened, unmatured cheese. Green cheese is only green in the sense that a raw recruit is said to be green. This the original sense of green cheese recorded from the C14th century onwards.Of course, if a cheese is physically green, you can call it \"green cheese\". Nobody is going to stop you. I have neither the time nor the weaponry.And anyhow, the OED records that sense too. This quotation is from 1673:They [the Dutch] have four or five sorts of Cheese... Green Cheese, said to be so coloured with the juice of Sheep's Dung.But the original green cheese was usually white. Moreover, cheeses, traditionally, were usually round. This makes it a near certainty that the moon is made of green cheese; and that that's why you have a new moon every month, to keep it green.

And the groundhog and the warthog and the road hog and that none of them, except maybe the last, contains bacon. And of course a wart-hog is just that. It's a hog with what appear to be warts. But a guinea pig doesn't look like a pig at all. Nor does a hedgehog. A hedgehog looks a bit like a porcupine.And then, if you mull of the word porcupine enough:PorcupinePorkupinePorkpineYou suddenly realise that a porcupine is merely a pork with spines, from the Old French porc-espin. It's enough to make a strictly kosher chap run screaming for the ocean, where of course there are no pigs at all. Unless a sea-pig existed.

It's published by Three Rivers Press and you can read all about it, or even purchase it by following this link, or by toddling down to a bookstore.The book should feel at home on that continent, as it has two chapters devoted to American drinking: one on the Wild West saloon and what it was actually like; and one on the subject of Prohibition and how, contrary to myth, it actually pretty much worked.So in celebratory spirit, and in no particular order, here are some facts about drinking in America taken from the book.1) In 1797 the largest distillery in America produced 11,000 gallons of whiskey a year. It was owned by the great distiller of early America, a man called George Washington.2) The Pilgrim Fathers weren’t meant to land at Plymouth Rock, but the Mayflower had run out of beer. So they had to stop there.3) American settlers, unless they lived very close to a brewery, drank spirits because they were easily transportable. A Kentucky breakfast was defined (in 1822) as ‘three cocktailsand a chaw of terbacker’.A cocktail here is in essence exactly what it sounds like: a ‘Cock tail, then, is a stimulating liquor, composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water, and bitters’ (1806). Whiskey for breakfast could be considered a challenge even then, so by mixing in a little fruit juice, or whatever came to hand, youcould take in all the health-giving benefits of an alcoholic breakfast (which were still believed in) and not vomit.4) A lot of the booze sold in Old West saloons was fake. Here is a contemporary recipe for making something apparently indistinguishable from rye whiskey.Neutral spirit, four gallons; alcoholic solution of starch, one gallon; decoction of tea, one pint; infusion of almonds, one pint; color with one ounce of the tincture of cochineal, and of burnt sugar, four ounces; flavor with oil of wintergreen, three drops, dissolved in one ounce of alcohol.5) Prohibition didn't fully end until 1966 when alcohol became legal in Oklahoma.6) Prohibition is a major reason that Italian food became popular in America, but to find out why, you will have to buy the book.A Short History of Drunkenness can be bought from all good bookstores, and, I suspect, some bad ones. And purchased at all the usual sites on the World Wide Web. Follow this link for much more information.And remember that Americans have always liked a tipple. There was a man called Frederick Marryat who travelled the USA in the 1830s and wrote a book trying to describe this new country to old Europe. He records that in the USA:If you meet, you drink; if you part, you drink; if you make acquaintance, you drink; if you close a bargain, you drink; they quarrel in their drink, and they make it up with a drink."},

The name seemed to encapsulate speed and glamour and whatnot.

Ursa Minor is so far North that it even contains the Pole Star.Ursa is just the Latin word for bear (and constellation is Latin for together stars (con-stella)). That's why louche English astronomers will call these constellations the Great Bear and the Little Bear.But Greek astronomers, being Greek, didn't use either the Latin ursa or English bear, they used the Greek work Arctos, which also just means bear.So the Arctic is, literally, the bear-place. And the opposite end of the world is the Antarctic or Anti-Arctic or No-Bears-Here-Place.And that's why polar bears don't move to the Antarctic. They feel unwelcome, etymologically speaking. This may be a ploy on the part of the penguins.Mind you, polar bears are etymologically impossible, because bear come from the Proto-Germanic *bero, which means brown.So brown bears are brown browns.Oh, and grizzly bears are etymologically grey browns (from French gris), which is why I only use the Latin name Ursus Horribilis.And some bears have no fur at all. I despise them. I can't bear bare bears.The Inky Fool defending the etymological purity of AntarcticaP.S. Only a week until Short History of Drunkenness comes out in the USA"},
{"title": "Chile, not Chili", "date": "Thursday 8 February 2018", "text": "I'm off to Chile for a fortnight's holiday. The main thing about Chile, etymologically speaking, is that it is not the origin of the word chili meaning spicy stuff in food. That word comes from the Aztecs who lived all the way up in Mexico. Oddly enough, our standard word for the Aztec equivalent of beer - pulque - is from a language spoken in what's now Chile: Araucanian to be precise. This language also gave us gaucho, meaning wanderer, and poncho, meaning woolen cloth.So where does the name Chile come from? Nobody is very certain. But one theory is that it comes from a lost native language and means cold place or land's end. In which case it would be appropriate as the tip of Chile - Tierra del Fuego, or land of fire - is very cold even now, in their midsummer.Santiago, though, is rather warm, which is why I'm going.For more information about words of Chilean origin have a look at this old post about mamihlapinatapai.The hotel was not as described"},
{"title": "Losing your Rag in Rag Week in America", "date": "Tuesday 19 December 2017", "text": "I've been going through A Short History of Drunkenness for the American edition, changing those words and phrases that would be incomprehensible on the farther shores of the Atlantic. It's a process that I find utterly fascinating.Some of the phrases are expected: \"Does exactly what it says on the tin\" comes from a British advertising campaign of the 1990s. I was surprised that rumpy-pumpy doesn't exist in America, but it was easily replaced with hanky-panky. But I became particularly curious about \"lost his rag\". This phrase not only doesn't exist in America, but I didn't really know why it existed in Britain.The phrase is first recorded in 1928:Finally, losing his rag completely, he extended his fingers to his nose and challenged any three men in the audience to come up on the platform and fight him.This goes back to an old Yorkshire term \"to get somebody's rag out\", and that in turn appears to go back to the use of rag to mean tease, torment, scold etc. That's the same rag that you have in Rag-Week at University: the first week when everybody chases each other around rather boisterously. And it's also the origin of the American phrase to rag on sombody as in this line from 1979:Critics all over the country..for years and years have been ragging on Joyce Carol Oates.So Americans, it turns out, can be ragged on, but their rag cannot be gotten out, and nor can it ever be lost; they're just too good tempered.The other problematic differences were the absence of Postman Pat on those distant shores (the British version points out that a Sumerian drinking song can be sung to the theme music), and finding a precise American equivalent of Maidstone.Anyhow, A Short History of Drunkenness is already available in Britain, indeed the Spectator says that:My favourite book of this and possibly any other Christmas is Mark Forsyth's A Short History of DrunkennessAnd as it would make the perfect present for just about anybody, it should immediately be bought from a bookshop or one of these people:AmazonBlackwellsBook DepositoryWaterstonesAnd for all who don't know or remember here is the original Ronseal advertisement that changed our language, followed by the original Postman Pat theme.(American readers should note that the majority of British English is now based on this one advertisement)"},
{"title": "Why British Singers Sound American", "date": "Wednesday 13 December 2017", "text": "An American asked me the other day why so many English pop stars sing with American accents. Actually, that's not true. An American at the next table in the pub was asking loudly why English pop stars sing with American accents and I thought it would be a bit weird to lean across and explain. But if I had, I'd have said the following.From here on in, when I say \"American\" I mean the Mid-West accent, and when I say English I mean BBC English - this is largely because no pop stars sound Cornish. There are a bunch of differences between these two accents, but a lot of them involve vowels and are hard to write about, so, for the moment, let's concentrate on a nice simple one. In American, when a T-sound appears between two vowels it turns into a D. So butter in American is pronounced budder; pity is pronounced piddy; and little is liddle. An English soldier has a medal made out of metal; an American soldier has a medal made out of medal. The English say better, the Americans say bedder.The American pronunciation is actually a lot easier on the tongue. Try it. To pronounce the T in the middle of better you need to flick your tongue all the forward to touch your upper teeth and then pull it back in time for the vowel. In American all you have to do to make that D-sound is tap your tongue against the roof of your mouth.In fact, most of the standard differences in the American accent are easier to pronounce than their English counterparts. You could even, if you were so minded, say that they were lazier. This may make English people feel superior. We proud Brits take the time to pronounce things properly, unlike those lackadaisical Yanks. Huzzah!But we shouldn't think that, because sometimes the English pronunciation is the lazier/easier one. The English, for example, do not bother to pronounce the R on the end of words. Instead, we just say Uh. So singer in English becomes sing-uh and don't bother is don't both-uh. The Americans, with their strong work ethic and can-do attitude make sure that they say singerr and botherr.So, when, just now, I said that the English say better and the Americans say bedder, I lied. In fact:The English say bettuh (proper T, lazy R).The Americans say bedderr (lazy T, proper R)By proper here, I don't mean right and wrong. In fact, I've just been sitting here trying to say betterr, and it sounds very odd. I think I may be Welsh. It doesn't matter.The important thing is what happens when you pronounce both sounds the lazy way. You end up with bedduh - a sort of strange, hybrid, transatlantic mongrel of a word. But who would be so lazy as say it that way?The answer is, somebody who's concentrating on breathing, and hitting the right note, and getting the right emotion in, whilst simultaneously playing the piano. Here is a video of Paul McCartney pronouncing the word better. (And, yes, that's why I chose the word. Clever, aren't I?)Bedduh, bedduh, bedduh, BEDDUH.Here, on the other hand, is Mr Wilson Pickett, an American, singing the same song, and pronouncing better as bedduh. The lazy way on both sounds.And if you want a few others, here's Elvis, Katy Perry, Elton John (for one verse), and a Chinese lady called Yao Si Ting. They all sing Bedduh.They aren't trying to sing in an American accent or in a British accent; they're just trying to sing.Singing is difficult so both Americans and Brits default to the easier pronunciation of the consonants. With most consonants the easier pronunciation is American, so both Brits and Americans tend to sound pretty American. Or to be more precise their accent comes from somewhere about 150 nautical miles east of New York.Of course, there are some exceptions to this. First, classically trained singers spend a lot of time on training to get their words just right: fully pronounced consonants and nice clear vowels. They have to spend a lot of time on this because it's very, very difficult.Second, some English singers do try to sound American. Michael Jagger is definitely putting it on.Third, some English singers do pronounce their Ts. Roger Waters springs to mind.But most of the times they're just taking the route of least resistance. D-ing their Ts, unrounding their Os and dropping their yods.And if you're wondering what that last term means, English people put a sort of Y sound in words like tune and new, which we pronounce t-yune and n-yoo (to exaggerate it slightly), but which Americans often pronounce as toon and noo. This is called yod-dropping.And I shall leave you with mystery:based on her yods, what nationality is the female singer of A Whole New World?That's right, she's from the Philippines.Anyhow, there are lots of other differences between American English and British English. I spent yesterday going through my new book, A Short History of Drunkenness, changing incomprehensible Britishisms so that they would be comprehensible for the American edition (out in May). This is troublesome when it comes to the drink that Scotsmen call whisky and Americans call whiskey.The Spectator said this week that:My favourite book of this and possibly any other Christmas is Mark Forsyth's A Short History of DrunkennessWhich means that you should almost certainly buy it immediately and thus solve all your Christmas-present-buying problems in one.

The notion that they do is a myth, a mirage, and a cold white lie. They certainly don't have fifty of the damned things.We have a few words of our own: snow, blizzard, sleet, slush, powder and neve (a field of even snow). And if we feel this isn't enough, we simply invent compounds: snowstorm, snow-flake, snow-flurry, snow drift, snowfall and snowperson.It is exactly the same in your average igloo. The Eskimo-Aleut languages (of which there are several) have a few bases and many compounds. So the next time somebody repeats this porkie to you, cudgel him.The urban myth of the Eskimo's verbosity did give rise to the young and useful word snowclone. A snowclone is hackneyed sentence structure. X is the new rock'n'roll. What do you get if you cross an X with a Y?*The reason it's called a snowclone is that so many hackneyed hacks have written something along the lines of:If Eskimos have N words for snow, X surely have Y words for Z.Snowclone was invented by a language blog called Language Log, which goes to show something, but I don't know what.The past tense of snow used to be snew, on the same pattern as grow and grew or know and knew. So it snew in the night.This from Froissart's Chronicles (1525):Also it rayned, blewe, & snewe, that it was a mervaylouse yvell wether.And this from Holinshed's describing special effects in a theatrical production of Dido in 1583:It hailed small confects, rained rosewater, and snew an artificiall kind of snow.*I imagine that the answer would be that you'd get back together with her."},
{"title": "Dumbbell ", "date": "Thursday 7 December 2017", "text": "Sometimes an etymology is so obvious, once you see it, that you can't think why you never saw it at all. A dumbbell was, originally, a bell that didn't ring.The idea is pretty simple really, bell-ringing is a form of exercise. Church bells are big heavy things and a bell-ringer must really tug on that rope. I once wrote a post explaining that to ring a full peal of bells takes several hours and a huge amount of energy (was that seven years ago? I've been doing this for much too long). The problem is that, as a form of regular keep-fit, it's a trifle noisy and will get on your neighbours' nerves.Hence the dumb-bell. The first reference is from Joseph Addison writing in The Spectator in 1711:For my own part, when I am in town, for want of these opportunities, I exercise my self an hour every morning upon a dumb bell, that is placed in a corner of my room, and pleases me the more because it does every thing I require in the most profound silence.  My landlady and her daughters are so well acquainted with my hours of exercise, that they never come into my room to disturb me while I am ringing.So what exactly did such a mute piece of gym equipment look like? Well, here's one from the Seventeenth Century that survives (I think) at Knole House in Kent:Basically, the sticky-out bits have weights on them. When you pull on the rope (from below) they rotate, as a bell does, and then, through momentum, wind the rope up again. You now give another pull and so on and so forth. There's a little more information to be had by following this link to a modern dumb bell manufacturer.At some point somebody seems to have taken those sticks with the weights on the end off the dumb bell and started using them on their own. Thus the modern dumbbell.In other news, tonight I shall be at Waterstones Piccadilly from seven until nine signing A Short History of Drunkenness, other books by me, cheques, Czechs and off.On Monday, I shall be doing my Dickens show in Clapham.Next Saturday (the 16th) I shall be at Libreria bookshop in Shoreditch doing a reading at seven. The Inky Fool's new alternative to Uber"},
{"title": "Dickens Explained in Clapham", "date": "Tuesday 5 December 2017", "text": "Anybody who's read The Merry Wives of Windsor (written in about 1598) will have been surprised to see a reference in it to Charles Dickens (born 1812). It's in Act II scene 2 and goes like this:MISTRESS PAGEI cannot tell what the dickens his name is myhusband had him of. What do you call your knight'sname, sirrah?ROBINSir John Falstaff.The reason for this is feat of anachronism is that the Dickens in what the dickens has nothing to do with the surname; it is, instead, a euphemism for the Devil. It may be that there was the Devil, and then there was a little devil or devilkins. Kin is common English diminutive as in lambkin or bunnykins or napkin (a nap used to be a tablecloth).The diminutive kin is also the source of the English surname Dickens which is Little Richard (if you're into rock'n'roll) or Little Dick (if you're a puerile giggler, as I am). And the surname Dickens is the source of Charles Dickens and Charles Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol, which is the best Christmas story ever written, and there's an actor called Martin Prest who can recite the whole thing, and he's going to be doing so on Monday in Clapham at Bar Humbug, and I'm going to be interrupting him to explain the origins of Christmas Traditions and it ought to be a great show, so you should come along if you're in London.More information and tickets and the like can be found by following this link. Meanwhile I'm doing a talk at Hungerford Books tomorrow (Wednesday 5th), and on Thursday Evening I shall be sitting in Waterstones Piccadilly with a pen ready to sign any and all books that are thrown at me*.*In all seriousness, I was once doing a signing in Waterstones Piccadilly and a foreign gentleman came up to me, put a book in front of me, and asked me to sign it. I had a good look at it and explained to him that it wasn't my book. \"No,\" he said. \"You sign it.\"\"But I can't really sign it,\" I replied, \"if I didn't write it.\"\"You are author, yes?\"\"Well, yes, but not...\"\"You sign it. It's for my daughter.\"\"But this is by...\" I had a look, and the book didn't actually have an author, or not one who'd been prepared to put their name to it, which was surprising as it was a self-help book, and the cover said it was all about feeling \"self-worth\".\"It's for my daughter.

{"title": "Kalsarikännit", "date": "Friday 1 December 2017", "text": "I've just discovered that there is a Finnish word for \"getting drunk at home in your underwear with no intention of doing anything else\". The word is kalsarikännit. This is important news.At first, I didn't believe it. There are a lot of amazing-foreign-words-with-sentence-long-definitions that either don't exist, or only exist in a very theoretical sense. Yes, a German might be able to put all those words together in the same way that I might be able to say snow-gobbling-day, it doesn't mean that there's such a word in common English usage.But kalsarikännit is real. The etymology is quite simple: kalsarit means underpants, and känni means to be drunk. So it's underpants-getting-drunk. I don't quite know where the with no intention of doing anything else comes from: it may be poetic license, but I suspect that if you are drunk and in your underpants it would be hard to attempt any task of merit and importance, especially outdoors, especially in Finland.Tolkien taught himself Finnish as a child in order to read the epic poem Kalevala. I, on the other hand, didn't. So I'm a little unclear on the grammar, but so far as I can tell kalsarikännit is the verb and kalsarikänni is the noun, though I may have that wrong, the sources vary. It's pronounced CARL-sarri-KAN-nit. [See video below, and top comment for greater detail]Naked drinking has been quite a thing, historically speaking. In the London Gin Craze or the early 18th Century, poor people took to selling their clothes to buy spirits, resulting in mass public nudity. In Ancient Egypt at the Festival of Drunkenness all clothes were removed at around midnight when the sex began, and in early colonial Australia people got drunk and gambled:To such excess was this pursuit carried among the convicts, that some had been known, after losing provisions, money, and all their spare clothing, to have staked and lost the very clothes on their wretched backs, standing in the midst of their associates as naked, and as indifferent about it, as the unconscious natives of the country.There are also accounts of naked drinking in Russia and Ancient China, and of course there was Noah in his tent. That however was unintentional self-exposure. It's something of a theme in the Bible. Here is Isaiah describing (in a roundabout way) Egyptian foreign policy. Egypt is like someone:...who gives drink to his neighbours, pouring it from the wineskin till they are drunk, so that he can gaze on their naked bodies!You will be filled with shame instead of glory.Now it is your turn! Drink and let your nakedness be exposed!All of these fascinating facts are of course mentioned and enlarged upon in A Short History of Drunkenness, which is a book by me. It can be bought from these lovely people, or in a real bookshop.AmazonBlackwellsBook DepositoryWaterstonesIn other news, I'll be doing a talk at Hungerford Books on the 6th, a signing at Waterstones Piccadilly on the 7th, and a show about Dickens' Christmas Carol in Clapham on the 11th.Incidentally, a tip of the hat should go to the Spectator's review of Icebreaker: A Voyage Far North, where I discovered this."},

I was idly flicking through the Psalms (or Salmos, which is the strange Spanish spelling) when I came across this:Hasme puesto en el hoyo profundo, En tinieblas, en honduras.Which seemed, to my ignorant eye, to say:You have put me in a deep pit, in darkness, in Honduras. Which seemed an odd thing to happen to a chap in Jerusalem, and also to be rather rude about Hondurans. However I should have read it as:You have laid me in the lowest pit,In darkness, in the depths.Because that's what Honduras means: The Depths. It was, apparently, named after the adjacent sea, which is rather profound.Anyhow, here are a few more of greater or lesser obviousness:El Salvador = The SaviourNevada = Snowy (because of the mountains)Costa Rica = Rich CoastPuerto Rico = Rich Port (because Spanish adjectives are agreeable)Florida = Was discovered on Palm Sunday, which, in Spanish, is Pascua Florida or Flowering Easter. It's therefore named in almost exactly the same was as Easter Island. It's also cognate with Florence (blooming city), florid and floral. Also, the Florin was the coin of Florence, so called because it had a lily - the symbol of the city - stamped on one side.And those who've read The Etymologicon will already know that:Ecuador = EquatorVenezuela = Little Venice (because the natives lived on little huts on poles out in the water)I am sad to report, though, that Quito does not mean removed.None of which has anything to do with this the historian Dan Snow, but I did do a long interview with him for his podcast about the new and wonderful book A Short History of Drunkenness.

{"title": "Tutus, Cul-de-Sacs and French Bottoms", "date": "Monday 20 November 2017", "text": "A tutu (the thing that ballerinas wear) is a bum-bum, or an arse-arse if you prefer. Or, if you are of the American persuasion, I suppose it's an ass-ass. It's an alteration of cucu, which is itself a shortening of cul-cul, which is French for arse-arse. The French are terribly relaxed about such things, the British, thank God, are uptight and anxious. The very first mention of the tutu in 1910 said:She wished to exhibit what in technical slang is called le tutu, a term descriptive of the abbreviated costume and possessed also of a secondary meaning.And that secondary meaning was arse. (If, by the way, you were wondering what a tutu was called in Britain before 1910, it was a parasol-skirt).The French are always inserting their arses into the English language. There is, for example, the cul-de-sac which literally means arse of a bag and which sneaks onto English street signs without anybody noticing. Before this disgusting French term was introduced, the English had a much better, cleaner native term for a dead end; we called it a butt-hole. Indeed, the Oxford English Dictionary's butt-hole entry lists this as the only meaning.butt-hole  n. a blind hole, a cul-de-sac.1905   Westm. Gaz. 3 Mar. 3/2   The old dog's got him [sc. a badger] in a butt hole.I have never managed to get a badger into a butt-hole, because I don't have a dog.The reason for all this Gallic hideousness is probably a thing called the French Revolution. What happened was that French aristocrats wore knee-breeches, but the French poor didn't and were forced to wear unfashionable trousers. This infuriated the poor. There was a big fight and it was won by the without-breeches, or, in French the sans-culottes.To be fair, though, even occasional Frenchmen sometimes have enough decency to look at their language and decide that Something Must Be Done. Voltaire wrote a letter To The Men of Paris, and signed it with a fake name and address. The address is given as:l'impasse de St Thomas du Louvre; car j'appelle impasse, Messieurs, ce que vous appelez cul-de-sac: je trouve qu'une rue ne ressemble ni à un cul ni à un sac: je vous prie de vous servir du mot d'impasse, qui est noble, sonore, intelligible, nécessaire, au lieu de celui de culWhich translates roughly as:The Impasse of St Thomas du Louvre; what I call an \"Impasse\", gentlemen, is what you would call a \"cul-de-sac\": I find that a street resembles neither an arse or a bag: I would like to give you the word \"Impasse\", which is noble, sonorous, intelligible, and necessary, in place of the word \"arse\".Many, many streets in France are now called impasse, and the word seems to have been invented by Voltaire.And if this whole horrid subject has made you recoil like Voltaire, you should remember that recoil comes from the French reculer meaning to go back. You could also read less bottom-fixated writing such as, for example, the new book A Short History of Drunkenness. It's by me but, as I recall, it only contains one bottom and that's Odin's (it's to do with a legend about mead).A Have-Not (left) and a Have (right). Both are revolting."},

One of the amusing results is that I now understand some place names, especially in the New World.Everybody, I think, knows that Los Angeles means The Angels, but it's therefore rather fun to read Psalms 8v5, where we are told of God's creation of man:Le has hecho poco menor que los ángelesWhich translates roughly asThou hast made him a little lower than Los AngelesAs an English speaker, I just wasn't expecting it, and it made me giggle. Nor was I expecting 2 Chronicles 26v10 where I found:Porque tuvo muchos ganados, así en la Sefela como en las vegasWhich I puzzled over because I thought, with my limited Spanish, that he has won (ganado) something in Las Vegas, whereas he had, in fact, much livestock in the foothills, which is what las vegas are.The Bible, by the way, is rather a good way of picking up a language as the vocabulary is quite simple, the story is straightforward and often familiar, and there's lots of repetition. I'm only up to Proverbs, but I can't wait for the Nativity and the shepherds looking up to the sky to see Los Angeles.Anyhow, here is a brief list of the place names that now make sense to me:Antigua means old (cognate with antique), because Christopher Columbus named the island after a church in Seville, the Church of Santa Maria Antigua.Amarillo means yellow, probably because of the colour of the banks of a stream nearby.La Paz means the peace.El Paso means the pass, or the wayParaguay does not mean umbrella, despite the fact that the Spanish for umbrella is paraguas. This is an immense disappointment to me, as I'd love to visit a country called Umbrella.Rio de la Plata means silver river, which is appropriate as it passes Argentina which comes from the Latin for silver land.The Alamo is the poplar treeLos Alamos is/are the poplars. Do Spanish speakers treat it as singular or plural? I do not yet know.I visited Los Alamos once and my main memory of the place is that you couldn't get a drink anywhere in town on a Sunday afternoon, which is a long way round of reminding you, dear reader, that my new book A Short History of Drunkenness: How why, where and when humankind has got merry from the Stone Age to the present is out and just waiting to be bought.The Sunday Times had a lovely review that you can read here (though it's behind a paywall).

{"title": "Post and Mail", "date": "Friday 3 November 2017", "text": "I was sneaking around the new Postal Museum at Mount Pleasant when I discovered that, technically, there's a difference between post and mail, something that in my innocence I had never suspected.The word post in the sense of letters sent in envelopes is actually the same word that you have in post in the sense of job, or guard post, or indeed leaving your post. They all come from the Latin postum, which meant put in place. When a soldier is posted somewhere, he is positioned there by an officer.Back in the sixteenth century the a system was set up allowing the king to communicate quickly with all parts of England. To do this horses and riders were posted at various intervals along the main roads. When the king wanted to send a letter it was given to a rider who would gallop along to the next post where new horses were posted, the letter could be handed over and thus the whole system of posts ended up being called the post.This leads to the interesting question of what has actually happened when a postman abandons his post, or how uncomfortable it is for a high-flying executive to be posted to New York.Obviously, horses can't swim and so the whole postal system was just within Britain. If you wanted to send a letter overseas, to far-flung exotic places like Holland or Guernsey, you had to put it on a ship. A ship would carry a bag of letters, and as an old word for a bag was mail, these were the mail ships and the letters they carried were in the mail, and eventually they were just called the mail.So domestic letters were post, and letters sent abroad were mail. This distinction has now fallen into the well of forgetfulness, and it's probably not helped by the existence of e-mail and blog posts.Anyway, it does lead us forward to Alfred Harmsworth and the education acts of the 1880s. These brought in universal literacy in Britain, which meant everybody was able to read newspapers. This led to a boom in newspapers and the newspapers needed names. Alfred Harmsworth founded the Daily Mirror in 1904 and explained that \"I intend it to be really a mirror of feminine life as well on its grave as on its lighter sides\". The Mirror, you see, was originally aimed solely at women.Alfred Harmsworth also founded the Daily Mail in 1896, and if you buy a copy today, and turn to page 60 you'll find a review of A Short History of Drunkenness: How, why, where and when humankind has got merry from the Stone Age to the present. It's by a chap called Mark Forsyth and is available in all good bookshops for a mere £12.99. Apparently it's very good. According to the review it's \"astonishing\" and \"a book of some brilliance\".I think you probably ought to buy it.You can read the review online here.

Or you can buy it over the internet from these lovely people:AmazonBlackwellsBook DepositoryWaterstonesOr you can request it for Christmas, which is coming, or you can buy it for Christmas for all your friends and relations. For that matter you can buy it for your enemies. Margaret Atwood says that A Short History of Drunkenness is \"Highly suitable for Xmas!\" But it can be obtained now, in November, and it would probably work very well for Guy Fawkes Night or Thanksgiving or The Feast of Winefride, which is tomorrow.So you'd better hurry.According to the Oxford Dictionary of Saints the life of St Winefride was a \"tissue of improbabilities\", by which they mean it's untrue. But A Short History of Drunkenness: How, why, where and when humankind has got merry from the Stone Age to the present, is a tissue of improbabilities that are true. It's all been thoroughly researched and fact checked. So when I talk about 150 drunken elephants going on the rampage in India in the 1980s, it actually happened.So off to the bookshops.

{"title": "Wine Names, West Hampstead and Hubris", "date": "Tuesday 31 October 2017", "text": "A little etymology, a little drink, a little bit of self-aggrandisement. The names of wine are always a little magical and mysterious, and as the job of etymology is to remove all magic and mystery from the world, I thought I would go through the names of some of the most common grapes and explain them.For example, sauvignon blanc has a certain je ne sais quoi to it, or it does until you realise the sauvignon just means wild. It's cognate with savage, you see. They were just grapes that grew wild and so sauvignon blanc just means wild white.A pinot is a pine tree, and so pinot noir is black pine and pinot grigio is grey pine.Chablis means deadwood. However, the name is not direct. There's a town in South Dakota called Deadwood, and there's a town in France called Deadwood, except the French, being French, call it Chablis, because that's the French for Deadwood. The grapes simply come from near there.The French word for blackbird is merle, and the French word for a little blackbird is merlot. This may be because blackbirds liked to feed on this variety of grape as it grew. Or it could be down to the colour.Grenache comes from the Spanish Garnacha which in turn is comes from the Italian Vernaccio, which just means common. It's exactly the same root as vernacular, because the vernacular is the common tongue.Temperanillo means the little early one, because it ripens early.Muscat just means musky. Oddly enough, it's cognate with nutmeg which is, or was, the nut muscada. It has nothing to do with the capital of Oman, where Muscat means hidden (the city is in the hills). Also, I'm afraid, Shiraz has nothing to do with the Iranian city of Shiraz (even though there are several books that claim it does). Nobody knows where the name shiraz comes from.There is an Italian town of Montepulciano, but they don't grow montepulciano anywhere nearby. This is a mystery.However, my location tomorrow evening (Wednesday 1st of November) is not a mystery and never shall be. I shall be giving a talk at West End Lane Books in West Hampstead at 7:30. The talk will be about my new book A Short History of Drunkenness: How, why, where and when humankind has got merry from the Stone Age to the present.So if you're in North London come along.You may be wondering whether or not to buy the book. I would refer the confused to the Cambridge historian Professor Peter Frankopan who says:'Sparkling, erudite and laugh out loud funny. Mark Forsyth is the kind of guide that drunks, teetotallers and light drinkers dream of to explain the ins and outs of alcohol use and abuse since the beginning of time. One of my books of the year.

{"title": "Plonk and a Short History of Drunkenness", "date": "Saturday 30 September 2017", "text": "Plonk, as in \"a bottle of plonk\", as in \"the cheapest wine on the menu\", was, originally, a bottle of plinketty-plonk. And plinketty-plonk was, originally, just a humorous English way of pronouncing the French term vin blanc.Well, I say English, but I mean Australian. The term is first recorded in that inverted land in 1927. It doesn't pop up in Britain until 1967, when the Daily Telegraph said that:Surely the word ‘plonk’ is onomatopoeic, being the noise made when a cork is withdrawn from the bottle?Which tells you something about the Daily Telegraph and perhaps about our post-truth world (did you know that that term post-truth was first recorded in 1992?).The Australian line makes sense as they have something of a history of wine-making, albeit a stuttering one. The early British settlers (voluntary and otherwise) didn't know much about planting vines, so in 1803 the Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Almanac printed some helpful guidelines that they had translated from a French manual. They included lots of instructions about what month to plant in, what month to prune in and so forth, which was was disastrous, as they had forgotten to adjust the French manual for the Southern Hemisphere and the eccentric Australian habit of holding summer in December.I know all this because I have written a whole book on the history of drunkenness called A Short History of Drunkenness, which will be released in Britain on November the second. It's a tour through the ages looking at how people went about getting drunk in different times and places. If you were in Ancient Egypt and wanted to get stinko where did you go? Who did you go with? What did you drink? How much did you drink? And how did drunkenness fit in to the culture and the mythology and all that sort of stuff.What was a Wild West Saloon actually like? Or a Viking feast? Or a medieval alehouse?Anyhow, you should definitely buy it, not because I say so, but because Margaret Atwood says so. So there. She has tweeted of my little book:Reading: A Short History of Drunkenness, @Inkyfool:Sulphuric acid in the gin? Highly suitable for Xmas! Many synonyms for \"drunk.\"When greatness descends upon the earth and comes anywhere near me, I come over all giddy, and need a drink.A Short History of Drunkenness may, can, should and shall be purchased here."},
{"title": "Spengler and the Christmas Tree", "date": "Wednesday 21 December 2016", "text": "A new Age of Miracles is upon us. For those not familiar with the works of Spengler, he had an idea that civilizations work in cycles. You have an Age of Miracles when all is wonderful, the woods are full of elves and it wouldn't surprise you in the slightest to meet a god on the way home.Then you have the Age of Theology, during which all the sightings of the gods from the Age of Miracles are categorised and analysed and formalised and explained, and generally have all the magic taken out of them. And thus theology leads you to logic and logic leads you to an Age of Science.In the Age of Science everything is logical and nothing is magical and this, according to Spengler, creates a great human thirst for something divine, which is why the Age of Science suddenly cracks, and the world is plunged back into an Age of Miracles, and the whole jolly cycle can start again.Spengler used to be terribly fashionable, back during the World Wars when it looked as though civilization was really ending. And then even more so during the Sixties when it looked as though something completely new was starting up. But then the 1980s happened, and it was generally agreed that there would be no new miracles and that Mr Spengler had been wrong.But now it turns out that Spengler was right. You see, I wrote in A Christmas Cornucopia that all true Christmas trees should contain a snake, because of the Christmas Tree's origin in the Paradise Plays of Medieval Germany. I even mentioned one Mrs Coulson of Swindon, who in the year 2000 found an adder in her tree. I even referred to it as a miracle, but as the last miracle.Well, I was wrong and Spengler was right. The BBC reports that a lady in Australia has found a highly venomous tiger snake hiding in her Christmas Tree. Clearly a new Age of Miracles has begun. Why it should have begun in Australia, I don't know. Clearly God has a sense of humour.And in case you were wondering what Christmas in Australia normally looks like, here's an illustration from 1881.Riddled with kangaroosN.B. Before anyone else points it out, that was a very, very, very rough summary of Spengler's ideas."},
{"title": "Myrrh, Myra and Father Christmas", "date": "Wednesday 14 December 2016", "text": "It's surprising the number of people who ask me what myrrh is. It's partly to do with having written a book on Christmas, and partly that people just like saying the word.The answer is that it's a kind of aromatic resin that you get out little thorny trees in the Middle East. The reason that the Magi turned up with a bunch of the stuff is partly that myrrh was just a nice standard gift. It smells good. You can rub it on yourself, or even use it to freshen your breath (in the sad old days before toothpaste). But in Matthew's Gospel, it almost certainly has a more precise meaning.Gold was a gift for a king, as it symbolizes worldly wealth and power. Frankincense was often used in religious rituals praising God and therefore points out that Jesus is both King and God. And myrrh was used to embalm the dead. This practice goes back to Ancient Egypt, but it continues in the New Testament where, in John's Gospel, Jesus is finally embalmed thus:And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. 19v39So the gift of the Magi was there to signify the little baby's ultimate painful death, which must have been lovely for Mary. Imagine turning up to a baby shower with a shroud.Anyhow, one place that was very good for harvesting myrrh was in what's now southern Turkey. Indeed, there was a whole city there that was named after its most famous export: Myra. The Bishop of Myra in the early third century AD was called Nicholas, and later he was called Saint Nicholas and later still he was called Sinterklaas, and nowadays we know him as Santa Claus.That's complete coincidence, of course, but I rather like it. I like the fact that the full proper title of Santa Claus would be Saint Nicholas of Myrrh.Anyhow, for more such Christmassy curiousities, you can of course snaffle a copy of A Christmas Cornucopia. It's around and about and terribly available from Amazon, Blackwell's, Book Depository, Foyles and Waterstones.That's the ticket"},

{"title": "Referendums and the English Gerundive", "date": "Tuesday 8 November 2016", "text": "Those who are obsessed with current affairs may have noticed that we had a referendum in June; incurable political junkies probably even know what the result was. I was rather intrigued to see a gerundive in the news.A gerundive is a rather funny thing, and it's easiest to explain it by analogy.In English we can take a verb, add -able to the end, and make an adjective. Doable, watchable readable, desirable etc. It's an adjective that means this-verb-can-potentially-be-done-to this task, this film, this book, this goat etc. You can even make a noun out of it and talk about the expendables, the undesirables, or, I suppose, the watchables*.In Latin you could take a verb, add -endum to the end, and make an adjective that meant \"this verb absolutely must be done to it\". The most obvious example surviving in English is agenda, which in Latin means \"the things that have to be done\". But there's also referendum which is the thing that has to be referred [to the people]. And there's a memorandum which is the thing that has to be remembered. And there's Amanda, the girl that you absolutely have to love (not to mention Miranda, the girl that you have to wonder about). That's a gerundive.There are a few more obscure gerundives skulking in the OED, like the corrigendum (that which must be corrected) and the explandandum (the thing that must be explained). There are also a few disguised ones. A dividend is the thing that must be divided [between the shareholders], and a legend was originally a legendum, a lesson that had to be read in church on a particular day. That then shifted to mean anything that was read, and ended up as a jolly good story.And of course there are a few in actual Latin. If I challenge you to prove a particular thing, you can set off on a line of logic until you've got to the desired result at which point you can say QED, quod erat demonstrandum, which (quod) was (erat) the-thing-that-must-be-demonstrated (demonstrandum). There's mutatis mutandis, which means when you've changed (mutatis) the things that must be changed (mutandis). And then there's dear old Carthago delenda est, which means Carthage is must-be-destroyed.But as anybody will tell you there's no gerundive in English. Well, to be honest, not anybody will tell you that. There are probably whole droves of people who don't think about gerundives from one week to the next. But any classicist will tell you that there's no gerundive in English. But they're wrong. There is, and there has been for about thirty years now.A quick consultation with Mr Google shows that in the last 24 hours the news has referred to \"a must-have Christmas gift\", a \"must-read response\", and \"must-have sexy essentials for holiday fun\"**.Now, that formation looks to me exactly like a gerundive. It's formed with the prefix must- followed by the verb, but it's doing precisely and exactly the same job. You could even form a noun and talk about \"this season's must-haves\". And a quick consultation with Mrs Ngram shows that the usage only took off in the 1980s. Here's a graph.So English does have a gerundive, and has had this new grammatical form for thirty years now. After lying dormant like a grammatical King Arthur for a thousand years, it has arisen.Speaking of this season's must-reads. A Christmas Cornucopia remains out. It's been out and proud for five whole days now and remains the perfect Christmas gift. Also I'll be doing talks and readings on:November 15th at Hungerford Bookshops17th at The Bookcase in Lowdham Nottinghamshire25th at Rossiter Books, Ross-on-Wye26th Hay Winter FestivalDecember 3rd Blackwells Oxford8th Waterstones Gower StreetAs a little post script. The word referendum isn't recorded in classical Latin, it was invented to describe Swiss political processes; it can also mean \"a memo that must be referred to a superior\", and Fowler says that the plural should be referendums as referenda is ambiguous and could mean \"several things that are referred to the people\" or \"one thing referred to the people several times\".*I'm am not for a second suggesting that The Expendables is watchable. It's a crime against the great glories of late 80s action movies.**Very well, here's the link. Although I should warn you that I don't believe you could actually pass that off as a relaxation aid, even in South Africa."},

I have no idea why, but I shall use that term forever.In the Navy a welsh rarebit is, apparently called a Cardiff Virgin. It's a pun, but you have to think about it.Finally, the word Nagasaki is used to refer to anywhere strange and distant, in roughly the way we lubbers of land talk about Timbuktu (as in \"It's the best thing this side of Nagasaki/Timbuktu\"). Oddly, it seems to have nothing to do with nuclear weapons. So a particularly thin sailor can be called a Nagasaki greyhound, and a chap with particularly large wedding tackle is said to be rigged like a Nagasaki donkey.Oh, and sea salt is called Neptune's dandruff.In other news, my new book A Christmas Cornucopia is coming out on Thursday and can already be pre-ordered from Amazon, Blackwell's, Book Depository, Foyles and Waterstones.

So, in the interests of something or another, I feel I should comment on the great debate of whether the dying Nelson said \"Kiss me, Hardy\" or \"Kismet, Hardy\". The latter seems preposterously unlikely as kismet is a Turkish word that isn't recorded in English until 1849, 44 years after Nelson's demise. Unless he was secretly a Turk.On another note, the great signal sent at the Battle of Trafalgar \"England expects that every man will do his duty\", was originally meant to be \"England confides\". Confide here means is confident that, rather than the usual modern meaning of telling you a secret and thereby taking you into my confidence. Anyhow, confide wasn't in the signal book and would have to be spelled out letter by letter, so expects was picked as we might pick a word for predictive texting.

So there are a lot of smiths, and a lot of millers. But most of them are ones that I had never thought about. I've known the word Ferrari since I was a small boy, but it never occurred to me that the Fer meant iron and that the famous red car is simply a Smith. The same goes for all those Kowalskis. Anyway, click and have a look.Incidentally, though I don't like to cavil, Murphy doesn't seem to belong here. It's from O Murchadha, a tribal name meaning the descendants of  Murchadh. Murchadh was a chap and his name meant sea-warrior. But that doesn't make it an occupational surname in the way that this map maps so wonderfully, as it doesn't map the most common occupation merely the tribe that bred the most. Murdoch, on the other hand, which is etymologically related, does mean sailor.For another hidden Smith, see this old post of mine."},

Trullibubs means entrails, but can also be a \"jeering term for a fat man\". And a kallithumpian band is one composed of a bunch of drunk people banging pots and pans and blowing whistles.I also know, for absolute certain, that Coca Cola did not invent the modern Father Christmas with their advertising campaign in the 1930s.This is from 1923, and it's an advertisement for White Rock ginger ale."},
{"title": "Today Is Not Boxing Day", "date": "Saturday 26 December 2015", "text": "A little repost from 2010:Today is not boxing day.Once upon a time, there was a thing called a Christmas box. A Christmas box was a box with a small hole cut in it, like a piggy bank, through which coins could be dropped. It was kept in a church and, like a piggy bank, it could not be opened, only smashed. The smashing was done at Christmas, hence the name: Christmas box.Christmas boxes were used by servants, apprentices, bloggers and other impoverished fools to save up some money for the frosty and festive season. In gambling dens there would be a Christmas box of tips for the benefit of the butler. As one chap put it in 1634:It is a shame, for a rich Christian to be like a Christmas boxe, that receives all, and nothing can be got out, till it be broken in peeces.Anyway, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the idea of the Christmas box shifted. There were lots of chaps like postmen and milkmen and butchers' boys and bloggers who didn't have loose change to be stowing away all year. Yet they still felt they deserved a little something at Christmas. So generous Victorians would make a little box of presents which they would present to all the delivery boys on the first weekday after Christmas, thus insisteth the OED.The first weekday after Christmas therefore became known as Boxing Day. And today?Today is a Saturday.All those pleading postmen, beggarly bloggers and other assorted lazzaroni will arrive at your door on Monday morning, their usual truculence usurped by a poor smile and rich words. As Mr Weller remarks of his son's attempt at a Valentine's card in The Pickwick Papers:''Tain't in poetry, is it?' interposed his father.'No, no,' replied Sam.'Wery glad to hear it,' said Mr. Weller. 'Poetry's unnat'ral; no man ever talked poetry 'cept a beadle on boxin'-day, or Warren's blackin', or Rowland's oil, or some of them low fellows; never you let yourself down to talk poetry, my boy.'You have, dear poetic reader, been warned.(A beadle, by the way, was a sort of policeman paid for by the parish)."},

A historian called Paul Booth was happily leafing through the archives of Chester County Court when he came across (if that is the right expression), a defendant called Roger Fuckbythenavel.Now, Roger is, of course, a funny name, and I've always thought it appropriate that James Bond was played by a double entendre; but it's the surname here that is new and a trifle surprising. I've spent a little while trying to see if there could be any other meaning at all. And I can't. It's...How do you get a name like that?Here I could hypothesise until the home-coming of the cows, but I assume that it must have been a nickname based on poor Roger's poor rogering, or perhaps on some misconception bred from the lack of sex education classes in Chester. Anyway, it didn't have a good effect on him. Roger Fuckbythenavel was summoned to court three times over the next two years, and it all ended with him being outlawed, which isn't as romantic as it sounds.

{"title": "Capital Geezers of Iceland", "date": "Tuesday 27 October 2015", "text": "Few things are as tedious as other people's holiday photos. That's why facebook exists: it allows people to show their photographs without anyone bothering to look. With that in mind, would you like to see my holiday photographs? You would? Splendid. I've just got back from Iceland.That's a sign for the Hotel Geysir*. I didn't actually stay there. Just took a photo of the sign because Geysir is a place in Iceland and all of the other geysers in the world, all of those big, spurty things are named after that place. The Icelandic word for geyser isn't geyser or even geysir (with a funny comma on it). They call them either laug, which means bath, or hverr, which means cauldron. But European travellers didn't know that, and so they took the place name and carried it off around the world.To be fair though, the place name is related. Geysir basically means, and is cognate with, gusher.Anyway, would you like to see another photo of Geysir? No? What if I told you the photo was utterly hilarious? Now, the reason that photo is hilarious is that there's a sign in the foreground saying NO SMOKING but in the background there's what looks like smoke. So it looks as though the ground is breaking the law!!!!! How we did laugh.They've even got the sign in Icelandic REYKINGAR BANNABAR: Smoking Banned.Of course it's not smoke. It's steam. But it looks like smoke. All of which explains Reykjavik (the name Reykjavik, that is, not the bus system or the price of a beer).The first man ever to arrive in Iceland and want to stay for the winter was a chap called Ingolfr Arnarson (and his wife). He (and his wife) had taken the high seats from a temple to Thor and he decided to toss them (and his wife) off the side of his boat to see where they washed up. (That's not true about his wife, although she probably did occasionally wash up). The seats washed up in a bay that had lots of geothermal vents a bit like the ones inland at Geysir, and because they looked like smoke rather than steam, and because the Icelandic** for smoke was reykja and the Icelandic for bay was vik, he called it Reykjavik***.Meanwhile, the Cockney geezer has nothing to do with geysers at all, it comes from the Nothern word guiser, which means someone in fancy dress (like dis-guise), which means someone who looks a bit foolish.And here's a photo of me with a dominatrix puffin.*I'm afraid I have less than no idea how to type Icelandic diacriticals. ** Yes, yes, I know.*** It was initially Reykjarvik, but the point stands.

{"title": "Tin Pots Bells and McDonald's", "date": "Monday 1 June 2015", "text": "I've been reading a novel called A Lady From The South, which is a peculiar little adventure novel so little known that I had to find it in the Rare Books room of the British Library (the copy I'm reading is NOT TO BE INTRODUCED INTO THE BRITISH EMPIRE). Anyway, it contains this little passage:\"In the ordinary way,\" pursued Miss Milligan, \"a tin-pot President's job doesn't amount to anything, but in Guayacuador it's different. There are the tin mines, for one thing...\"And it made me wonder where the term tin-pot came from. I realised that I had been quite casually referring all my life to tin-pot dictators without ever wondering why a dictator would be in a pot at all, and why that pot would be made of tin.In fact, tin-pot, in origin, has nothing to do with dictators at all. It's a kind of bell. If you can afford it, you should have your bell cast in iron at a great big bell foundry, and you'll get a lovely resonant sound. If you can't afford it you can always find an old tin can and add a little clapper with a piece of string. This is a tin-pot bell and seems to have been common practice, especially among Australian shepherds who would attach such things to the necks of their flocks, as in the lovely poem I Don't Go Shearing Now by Walter Alan Woods:Then with saddle for a breakwind and your oilcloth tucked in well, You will listen for the tinkling of the little tin-pot bellYou'll find similar references to tin-pot bells in England in the C19th, and the important thing is that such bells are always emblematic of cheapness. They have no beautiful ding dong. Instead the sound is... well... tinny. (I'm willing to bet, but have been unable to prove, that this is where the adjective tinny comes from. The chronology certainly works, and I can think of no other explanation for associating sound and metal).Thus tin-pot became a universal adjective to mean cheap and inferior. It was applied to all things from bells to music to billiards, and finally, like all insults, to politicians, particularly those of the dictatorial type. It struck me that this is roughly the same process as the Mc prefix that derives from McDonald's the ubiquitous beef bunners. First McDonald's, then the McJob, the McMansion and now a whole entry in the OED under the prefix Mc-. Oddly enough, there were real McJobs in 1985, advertised by McDonalds, before the term became the subject of scorn. The LA Times reported that... the McDonald's fast-food chain recently began a training program for the handicapped in the San Fernando Valley called McJobs. McDonald's has hired a dozen people after the two 10-week training programs held so far.That's what you get for being nice.The Inky Fool's manifestoP.S. Another rather odd usage from A Lady From The South (1926). Mysogynist here clearly means not a skirt-chaser:George, like all reasonably impressionable young men, liked to think of himself as something of a misogynist, an aloof, interesting, slightly sinister figure, courteous always to the Sex, but sheathed in cynicism against the shafts of Eros."},
{"title": "Louche and Louching", "date": "Tuesday 17 February 2015", "text": "The other day, I was lying in bed, sipping a Campari, when it occurred to me to wonder where the word louche came from. I imagined that it had something to do with luxury, and fell back to sleep. Which didn't help the Campari.I was very wrong, because louche means cross-eyed. Or it did once. To be precise there was a Latin word luscus, which meant one-eyed. The feminine was lusca, from which the French got lousche, which meant cross-eyed or squinting. And then louche.Louche came into English in 1819, but it didn't mean what it means now. It had nothing to do with Camparis in bed. Instead it meant oblique, asquint, Not Straight-Forward. So the first usage is:There is some~thing louche about him, which does not accord with the abandon of careless, intimate intercourse.(Intercourse didn't mean what it does now either, lest you misunderstand Wordsworth's \"The dreary intercourse of daily life\"). For a good century, it seems louche kept its French meaning, but added to it the idea of being opaque, unclear and therefore dishonest. Only slowly, very slowly did it start to mean raffish, rakish, dissolute and bedbound Campari. This is recent enough, that the OED still doesn't mention that meaning.But there is another meaning of louche, and this I didn't know at all until I was checking all this up. Louche can be a verb.I don't know if you drink much pastis. Or ouzo? Or raki? Or absinthe? Or anything flavoured with aniseed. If you do, you should know of the strange thing that happens when you add water, for the beautiful clear liquid suddenly turns cloudy, and milky, and opaque. This is known as louching. It can be known as the ouzo effect, but louching is a much better word, and it allows you to louchely louche your louche drink. Next time it won't be Campari.By the way, another term for louching is \"spontaneous emulsification\", which reminds me of this song, because I really don't think he does know what emulsified means."},
{"title": "Farm Tax", "date": "Thursday 29 January 2015", "text": "Today I have been paying the farmer. Because, of course, farmers aren't farmers.Some people have trade surnames: Mr Baker, Mr Butcher, Mr Farmer etc. And these people happily imagine that in some way off medieval time they had an ancestor who was a baker or a butcher or a farmer. The first two are right, but the Farmers are wrong. Because a farmer is a taxman. Or was.The name has nothing to do with farms. Once upon a time, there was the Medieval Latin word firma, which meant a fixed payment. (It's related in this to firm, firmament, affirm etc). From this you got the Old French fermier and the English farmer all meaning tax collector, or one who collects a fixed payment. So Chaucer wrote (with his mind on what I'm doing today):Him ought not be... cruel As is a farmer to do the harm he can.This meaning of farmer actually survived all the way to the C19th, although by that time it had become rather odd.But, feudally, rich landowners used to collect taxes on the land they owned, and they would have middle-men who were responsible for collecting the tax from a particular area. These tax farmers were responsible for a single farm from a single piece of land. They often had responsibility for making sure that it was cultivated its most profitable extent. Often they lived there as a tenant farmer.People these days buy time-share apartments, which are often just referred to as time-shares. In the same way, the method of payment slowly came to be associated with the activity of agriculture. So the old words husbandman and churl were slowly replaced. And by the late C16th, farmer had become the standard word for somebody who simply owned a farm.But the surname dates from the C13th. And that's why I've been paying the farmer."},
{"title": "Moors and Marrakech", "date": "Thursday 15 January 2015", "text": "The weather in England is, frankly, deplorable. So I've booked a ticket to Marrakech in Morocco, only to find that they're the same place, etymologically speaking. Algeria is named after the city of Algiers (from the Arabic Al-Jazair \"the islands\"). Tunisia is named after the city of Tunis (which probably means something, but nobody can decide what). And Morocco is named after Marrakech (from the Arabic Maghrib-Al-Aqsa \"the far west\"). But wait (I hear you shriek), why did the As in Marrakech turn to the Os in Morocco? And why wasn't it named after Tangiers? And...Very well, Tangiers had already given its name to a fruit called the tangerine, and anyway Marrakech used to be the capital. As for the As to Os, they're much more fun and will get you straight to the Steve Miller Band. The French keep the As. They call it Maroc. And the Germans call it Marokko. But the English got terribly confused by Othello, and other Moors. You see for years in English, the inhabitants of North Africa have been known as Moors, who were Moorish. So when a country got called Morocco, the English (who had just been watching some Shakespeare) decided that it must be named after the Moors and altered the spelling to make it look a little more like Moor-occo, which is what we blithely assumed it was.But where does Moor come from? Well, once upon a time, during the Roman Empire, there was a province called Mauritania, and a chap from that province was called a Maurus, and hence Moor. And the odd thing is that even though Roman Mauritania was almost exactly where modern Morocco is, the words have nothing to do with each other (except in the English hybrid Morocco). But it goes further! You see the English thought, for some reason, that their traditional folk dancing had originated amongst the Moors, hence Morris Dancing, which is really Moorish Dancing.Moreover, there's a common first name meaning From Mauritania. Just as Adrian means from the Adriatic Sea, so all Maurices (and Morrises) should come from Mauritania. Of course, they don't. For example, Maurice Prince of Orange was born in Dillenburg in Germany, and became Stadtholder of the Netherlands. That's why when Dutch sailors arrived at a little island in the Indian Ocean previously called Dina Arobi, they renamed it, in their prince's honour, Mauritius.So, that's how you link Morocco, Marrakech, Mauritania, Moors, Morris Dancing, Mauritius, a novel by E.M. Forster and a song by the Steve Miller Band. Of course, the second I'd booked my ticket to Marrakech, the weather forecast was changed and next week looks cold there too. Will we never be set free?As a final titbit, the phrase \"in Morocco\" used to be a euphemism for naked."},

{"title": "Gotham City and Ladies' Underwear", "date": "Friday 2 January 2015", "text": "Herman KnickerbockerOnce upon a time, there were some goats (trust me, this is leading somewhere). These particular goats lived on a farm in Nottinghamshire a thousand years or so ago. This farm was therefore known as the Goat-Homestead or Gat-Ham. This later changed to Gotham. And the village of Gotham is still there to this day, just off the A453. There's a fish and chip shop there called Frydays.Now, in the Medieval period, the people of Gotham gained a reputation for being fools. One much later account records them:...some of the inhabitants engaged in endeavouring to drown an eel in a pool of water; some were employed in dragging carts upon a large barn, to shade the wood from the sun; others were tumbling their cheeses down a hill, that they might find their way to Nottingham for sale; and some were employed in hedging in a cuckoo which had perched upon an old bush which stood where the present one now stands.This may all have been a subtle ruse, because madness was once considered contagious. So the people of Gotham just wanted to be left alone. But, either way, Gotham became a byword for foolishness, and the people of Gotham became a byword for Fools.Now, we must journey forwards a few centuries, past the accidental discovery of a continent named America, to a chap called Washington Irving. Washington Irving was living in New York (which has fewer castles than the old one) and was working for a satirical magazine called Salmagundi. Salmagundi had the sole porpoise of making fun of the good people of New York, and so, in 1807, in the 17th issue, Mr Irving referred to New York as \"Gotham\". This was nothing to do with Goths or anything like that. It was merely to imply that New Yorkers were all as foolish as the people from the goat farm.Anyhow, Washington Irving was a New Yorker (who have few castles than Old Yorkers). He was thus and therefore acquainted with Herman Knickerbocker who represented New York in Congress. They were good friends and Irving said that they were like family. Mr Irving also had a plan to write a parodical history of New York under a pseudonym. As New York had originally been New Amsterdam, the pseudonym he chose was a Dutch one, based on his friend.A History of New-York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, by Diedrich Knickerbocker came out in 1809. And, for our purposes, the important thing about it was that it fixed Knickerbocker as the stereotypical Dutch name. From then on, the original Dutch settlers of New York were called the knickerbockers, and the funny trousers (or pants) that they wore were called knickerbockers too.Popularised by Mr Irving, and by George Cruickshank's illustrations, knickerbockers became a generalised term for odd bits of clothing worn beneath the waist. And thus and therefore, though American ladies wear panties, Englishwomen to this day wear knickers, which is just short for knickerbockers."},

There's usually something technological and a couple of portmanteaus that will never survive: Bralking! It's breathing and walking at the same time! Trampomeerschauming! It's bouncing on a trampoline whilst smoking a pipe! The problem with such lists is exactly the same as the Problem of Autobiography.Pretty much every autobiography I've ever read goes really flat towards the end. And there's a good reason for this: the author doesn't know where the narrative is going any more. He doesn't know how it ends. Or, to put it another way, every autobiography should end like this:And that, dear reader, is how I came to be sitting at this desk writing the words The End.The early chapters, the childhood section is easy, because, after all these years, we know what's important. So we know what to describe. The first time Eric Clapton picked up a guitar was a Big Moment. The first time Gordon Ramsay picked up a guitar was not a big moment. He put it down again and moved on. But the first time Eric Clapton cooked an omelette was Not Important. They, Eric and Gordon, know that now, but they didn't necessarily know it then. It is only What Happens Next that makes things important. And that's why autobiographies collapse in the last chapter. Because the writer doesn't know how he will die.It's also a sobering thought to think that yesterday might have been the most important day of your life, you just don't know it yet.All of which is a very long way round of recommending this article on all the new words that were first recorded in 1914.

{"title": "Et In Amusement Arcades Ego", "date": "Monday 8 December 2014", "text": "﻿Note the archesI'm terribly distressed to find that the above pun doesn't quite work. Arcadia - the Greek realm of shepherds and nymphs and rural loveliness - is, perhaps, named after Arkas, son of Zeus, who was allegedly its first king.Shopping arcades and amusement arcades are from the Italian word for arch: arcata. The idea is that an avenue covered with arcati* is therefore an arcade. Hence the Burlington Arcade, amusement arcades and arcade games.The reason I was wondering about this at all was that I was reading More Trivia by Logan Pearsall Smith (which is unutterably beautiful). In it, he talks of how, when he's out in the countryside he doesn't feel all free and liberated and back-to-nature, as a Romantic Poet should. Instead he longs for the city.I am incongruously beset by longings of which the Lake Poets never sang. Echoes and images of the abandoned city discompose my arcadizings; I hear, I the babbling of brooks, the atrocious sound of London gossip, and newsboys' voices in the cries of birds. Aracadizings (meaning, I suppose, wanderings in Arcadia) is a beautiful word nonetheless. I intend to use it when I scamper off to the Lake District for Christmas. And I suppose it could as usefully be used to describe shopping off Piccadilly. It is not, though, in the OED, which does have the verb to arcade but that only means to furnish with, or form into, an arcade, something that I have no intention of doing.Incidentally, Smith's book is the origin of the modern meaning of trivia, but I shall explain that some other time.The Inky Fool was always writing on tombs ﻿*I'm guessing this is the plural."},

Unless the conversation happens to be about the heretical belief that the Virgin Mary is herself a goddess, which the conversation very rarely is.Partially, I like it because of it sounds a bit like collywobbles and a bit like Collyweston (an old word for nonsense). But it’s related to neither of them. Etymologically, comes from the Greek kollurida, which meant little cakes. This is because the original Collyridians would bake little cakes and sacrifice them to Mary. Actually, that’s another reason I like the word. I like the fact that there’s a heresy named after cake.Anyway, I thoroughly recommend Twelve Curious Deaths in France, if you like mysterious, funny short stories. Heresy!"},

In a very real sense, it is the other way round. Human rights invented America.          - Jimmy Carter (39th President)And so on and so forth.

I forget which party is meant to be doing it, as I have no interest in parties not of the birthday variety. But the rich, it appears, are to be soaked sodden. This is rather odd when you think about it. Who are these soaking rich, and why are they so very, very moist?The answer, it appears, is that they aren't wet at all. Soaking the rich goes back to 1935 when F.D. Roosevelt was accused of soaking the rich with his taxes. The OED has:He thought he was being ‘clever’ when he tried to steal Huey Long's thunder by suddenly coming out with his ‘soak the rich’ tax message.The Americans had been using the word soak to mean overcharge or extort money since at least 1895. But it has nothing to do with moisture. It's to do with hitting people. Ever since 1699 people have been using the word sock to mean hit, beat, pummel, punch or bash. Often a mysterious it is inserted as in \"sock it to him\". The Americans, for some reason best known to the Americans, decided to start using soak for sock. So in 1892 they could say:To-day's Washington Post ‘soaks’ it to the Southern Democrats in the House And just as you can be hit for money, or stung for money, so you can be soaked, or socked, for money. So they're soaking [it to] the rich.There's even a lovely Mark Twain line from 1883 where you can see the word just tipping over. In The Art of Inhumation a salesman says:Why, just look at it. A rich man won’t have anything but your very best; and you can just pile it on, too—pile it on and sock it to him—he won’t ever holler.﻿﻿And that, dear reader, proves that a chap can be soaked dry.﻿﻿﻿By taxing umbrellas"},

A burning sun over head, whilst for hours immersed above the ankles in water, together with being exposed to the noxious marshy exhalations, have, alas! proved fatal to many, and have probably added more greatly to the numerous cases of fever, liver complaint, and dysentery, than anything else in the treacherous climate of India. Still with this hand-post of \" high road to the other world\" full in view, such are the attractions of this pursuit, that few who are fairly engaged in it can ever leave it off, until brought suddenly up by one of the above stumbling-blocks.

And it reminded me of mortgages and wardens.Back in the dear old Dark Ages when all was umbrous, the French used to borrow words from the Germans. Some of these words began with a W, which the French, being French, found hard to pronounce and changed them to a G. But not all the French. The northern Frenchmen could say their Ws and so French would end up with two forms of the word, one beginning with G and the other with a W. And then we English would import both. I don't know if you've ever wondered what the difference is between a guarantee and a warranty, but really there isn't one. It's the same word one via Southern French and one via the Northern.Similarly, when medieval chaps wanted to challenge somebody they would throw down their gage as a challenge. This sense still survives in en-gage (for marriage is really a long duel) and mort-gage, which, as I explained in The Etymologicon is really a death-challenge. Or, to be more precise, a death-wager, because gage gave use wage and wager, which both involve putting down items of value.And the third of these doubles is guard vs ward. Same words, pronounced differently. And the same thing goes for a warden and a guardian. Hence my long train of thought.The Inky Fool delivering his lecture"},

And schaft is just the German equivalent of -ness or -ship or -hood. It makes it a state of being.

But if you spark frequently, you sparkle. If you crack once, you crack. But if you crack frequently you crackle. If you charge into somebody once wearing full armour and carrying a lance, you joust. If you do it all the time, you jostle. Burst, bustle. Jog, joggle. Tramp, trample. Scuff, scuffle. Prate, prattle. Wade, waddle.One that I'd never noticed before was that if you push once then you shove, and if you push repeatedly into the earth with a spade, you shovel. It comes from the Old High German scioban.But there is a second shove frequentative. If you shove one foot forward, and then the other and so on and so forth, you shuffle.

{"title": "Harrogate and Moby Dick", "date": "Thursday 10 July 2014", "text": "I'm going to Harrogate this Sunday to do an event with the splendid Simon Garfield. It's at 5:30, and tickets are available here. In honour of this occasion I shall repeat this old post on how Harrogate gave the world coffee.So what does the opening of La Belle Dame Sans Merci by Keats have to do with the world's largest chain of coffee shops?O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,Alone and palely loitering?The sedge is wither'd from the lake.And no birds sing. Give up? I thought so. You never were one for hard work, were you, dear reader? The connection is in the sedge. Sedge is any kind of plant that grows on the banks of a lake or stream. More recently its meaning has dwindled to refer to plants of the cyperaceae family; and, really, unless you're a water-vole, the only place that you'll have heard of it is in the Keats poem. This takes us to a suburb of Harrogate in Yorkshire with a small stream flowing through it. Here is a picture of that stream*: You will notice the depressing lack of sedge. It must have wither'd, for there was sedge there once, as the suburb's name is Sedge-stream, except it's not. Yorkshire was, a thousand and bit years ago, overrun by Vikings, so most of their place names are Scandinavian, and the Viking word for Sedge-stream is Star-beck. Starbeck is only recorded from 1817 but it must have been around before because a) It has a Viking name and b) there were people there who had sex as early as 1379. This sex produced families, and those families were called, by a slight alteration in the name, Starbuck. Since 1379 two things have happened: the Quaker movement was founded and America was discovered. The result of this double-catastrophe was that among the first settlers on Nantucket Island was a Quaker family called Starbuck. Nantucket was a centre of the whaling industry and the Starbucks took up their harpoons and set off to seek their oily fortunes at sea. Valentine Starbuck met the King and Queen of Hawaii and took them to London where they got measles and died. Obed Starbuck sighted a coral atoll in the middle of the Pacific which was later named Starbuck Island in Valentine's honour. The point is that the Starbucks were famous whalers, which brings us to Moby Dick.Moby Dick is about a bunch of sailors having a whale of a time (whale, in case you were wondering, was early C20th American slang for a lot - whale of a job etc). The first mate of the whaling ship Pequod is called Starbuck, because the Starbucks were such prominent whalers. Moby Dick, aside from having a vaguely amusing name, is a favourite with American schoolteachers, which brings us to Jerry Baldwin.Jerry Baldwin was an English teacher from Seattle, who in 1971, along with a couple of friends, decided to start a coffee shop. He wanted to name it Pequod, after the ship in Moby Dick but was shouted down by his partners who pointed out that Pee is not a good syllable to have in a shop selling liquids. So the others cast around for a local name and found that there was an abandoned mining town near Mount Ranier called Camp Starbo. At this point Jerry Baldwin piped up and suggested a compromise. If he couldn't have Pequod, what about Starbucks,which sounds a little like Starbo and is a character in Moby Dick. They decided that this was a good name, and the rest is bad coffee. And it all goes back to a sedge-covered stream in Yorkshire.Gone fishin' *Stolen from Flickr without a flicker of conscience."},

George Villiers Duke of Buckingham owned a very valuable bit of land just off the strand next to Charing Cross. In 1672 he sold it to developers, but he made a condition of the sale that his name be commemorated for ever in the streets. So there was George Street. The name has since been treacherously changed to York Buildings, but George Court remains. Here's proof.But that wasn't enough for George Villiers Duke of Buckingham. He wanted his surname out there too. And so, running from Charing Cross to Embankment:Which all Londoners know to be the home of Gordon's wine bar. But that wasn't enough for him, he wanted the Duke bit out there too. So the made Duke Street. Unfortunately this is now called York Buildings, but it was there once. And then he wanted Buckingham Street, and he got it.But none of this is what makes me love the chap. So far, it's just been a little bit egotistical. That's all. Nothing really fun. George Street, Villiers Street, Duke Street, Buckingham Street. I can almost see him pointing out to the urban planners that his name was not, absolutely not, George Villiers Duke Buckingham. Oh no.His name, and the world had better remember this, was George Villiers Duke OF Buckingham, goddammit. Never forget the Of. And hence the best street name in London. A name so good, that even though the philistines at Westminster Council have changed it, they still have to keep the original mentioned on the sign.

{"title": "School - Holiday", "date": "Tuesday 20 May 2014", "text": "School means holiday. Or, at least, it used to. Back in Ancient Greece, the Ancient Greeks divided their ancient days between work and leisure. Work meant war-fighting, olive-oil-making, and pederasty. Leisure meant reading philosophy, discussing poetry, and pederasty. And the Ancient Greek word for leisure was skhole. The Romans took up the word schola, which again meant a break from work, and again therefore implied a lecture or a bit of reading or something... well scholarly. And by the time the word had got into Old English as scol, it meant nothing else.So school meant holiday.A school of fish, by the way, is unrelated to the scholarly school, but closely related to shoal.

{"title": "Hungry Rhetoric", "date": "Thursday 10 April 2014", "text": "When Joyce is too simplistic, Tolstoy too brief, Kafka too jolly and Lautreamont too bourgeois, it's time to read The Hunger Games. I've just finished. The third volume has as its catchphrase the rather catchy line \"If we burn, you burn with us\", and it occurred to me to wonder why the line is so... memorable, catchy, what you will. And when you inspect it, it's rhetorically rather interesting.The following will all make more sense to those who have read The Elements of Eloquence, but there we go.Firstly, there's the antithesis: we burn, you burn. Nice simple trick \"East is East and West is West\", \"Man proposes, God disposes\", \"You say potato and I say potato\". But there's more.There's the pleasant little repetition of burn. Indeed, it's repeated with one word in between, which is a buried diacope. \"Bond, James Bond\" \"Run, Forest, run\", \"burn, you burn\", \"Burn, baby, burn\"DISCO INFERNO!Sorry, I became rather carried away there.But finally, there is the chiasmus, the symmetry. You start with:YouThen you put a burn on either side:Burn, you burnThen you put \"we\" on one side and \"with us\" on the other:We burn, you burn with usAnd then you add an \"If\".Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. One for all and all for one. Nice to see you, to see you nice.So that's three pretty sure-fire rhetorical tricks - antithesis, diacope and chiasmus, hidden in one sentence, combined with remarkable dexterity, and thoroughly memorable.

{"title": "I Rare To Go", "date": "Thursday 3 April 2014", "text": "The other day, I was writing a text message in which I said that I was raring to go; and it struck me that rare is one of those odd verbs that you only see as a participle. Nobody ever says \"I have rared to go\", or \"I plan to rare a lot on Thursday\". It struck me that maybe you couldn't rare; maybe rare wasn't even a verb at all, as with sidling. But it turns out that you can rare, and indeed often do. You just spell it slightly differently. Rare is a variant pronunciation of rear. Rear is an Old English word meaning raise (indeed if you go back even further in time rear and raise come from the same root). So you can rear a child, for example, without it being rude, or having anything to do with the rear end (which comes from the French). Moreover, a horse can rear up on its hind legs. Horses do not do this simply in order to get things down from high shelves, they do it because they are impatient to get somewhere. They are rearing to go, or much more commonly raring to go.Indeed, the first recorded use of the phrase in the OED has a significant apostrophe. It's from a book called Cabin Fever from 1918‘Yuh ready?’ Foster's voice hissed in Bud's ear. ‘R'aring to go.Of course, horses only rear children when they are in a stable relationship.The first of the Inky Fool's equine kan-kan group was in training"},
{"title": "Adults and Adultery", "date": "Tuesday 18 March 2014", "text": "You don't have to commit adultery to be an adult, but you do need to have been an adolescent.I was rather surprised to find that the words adult and adultery have nothing to do with each other, apart from the prefix ad-, which hardly counts. Adultery comes from the Latin ad-altarare, where the second half is where we got the English word alter. Originally, it just meant that something had been changed and therefore falsified. From that you got the idea of corruption, to which was added (by the French) the notion of corrupting the marriage bed. Mind you, it's important to remember that the marriage bed can be corrupted by husband and wife having sex simply because they enjoy it. This is a sin. Even Chaucer says so in the Parson's Tale.The thridde spece of Auowtrie is som tyme bitwixe a man and his wyf..whan they take no reward in hire assemblynge but oonly to hire flesshly delit.I am confident that none of the readers of this pure blog would ever be so evil as to make sex enjoyable for themselves or others.Meanwhile, there was another Latin verb alescere, which meant to be nourished. By putting an ad- on the beginning you got adolescere, which meant to grow up, and that meant that somebody in the process of growing up was adolescent. The past participle of the verb was adultus, which just means having grown up. You can also, according to the OED, commit adultery by being a bishop when you shouldn't be. This means that I now have plans for this afternoon.The Inky Fool gives in to temptationP.S. There's a very kind review of The Horologicon here."},

{"title": "Less Fewers", "date": "Monday 3 February 2014", "text": "Really?I have been asked to pronounce on the explosive question of 10 Items or Less vs 10 Items or Fewer.Just in case anyone is unaware of this Great Issue of the Day, there is a rule that appears in every English style guide: less amount and fewer numbers. So if I drink fewer pints, I have drunk less beer. That's because pints are something you can count, whereas beer is just frothy liquid. Fewer children are less trouble.I have less hair, because I have fewer hairs.I have less shopping because I bought fewer items; fewer, in fact, than ten.That's the rule. But, as with most rules, it's worth checking whether it's correct. After all, all that you need to get a book out on the English language is a willing publisher and a high opinion of yourself. I am living proof.So, first let's check if you can use fewer for amount.I like him fewer.I am fewer happy today than yesterday.I am fewer tall than you.These are just plain wrong. And importantly they're not wrong because a style guide says so. They just Sound Wrong to A Native Speaker (SWANS). If a foreign friend were to talk like that you would giggle or gently correct them. This is not some rule known only to an elite few. It's SWANS, and SWANS is the most important rule of all.So, what happens if you use less for numbers? Can you get the same effect?I've drunk less pints than you.There are less than five children here.The answer must be less than five.10 items or less.Now, the thing about these is that though I know that the style guide tells me they're wrong, they aren't wrong in a SWANS way. They don't make you jump out of your skin. You would never be so rude as to correct a foreigner on this. The style guide says it's wrong, but it doesn't feel wrong. I spent an awful lot of time trying to think of an example that sounded Properly Wrong, and I couldn't. I retreated into the desert and meditated on the subject* and I just couldn't think of anything that really sounded bad.And then something really strange happened. That's one fewer mouth to feed.Sounds wrong. Properly SWANS wrong. If we go this route, the journey will be twenty minutes fewer.That's SWANS.I have a hundred pounds. He has fewer.That grates.I started to find loads of examples where fewer sounded wrong when applied to a number, and less sounded right. I became confused and frightened and decided to try a different tack.After style guides and SWANS, you can use God And Shakespeare (GAS) to decide what's correct. So I looked up fewer in the Shakespeare concordance.He used the word 3 times. 3 times in 39 plays. That's really odd. That's less than he used also. The word only appears in Henry IV 2 once and Henry V twice. That's it. However, it is always applied to number.Less, on the other hand, appears 225 times. And... and... I barely know how to tell you this:Thou, why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou.Shakespeare happily applies less to number as well as amount. Strange things are afoot at the Circle K.So after a strong drink and a lie-down, I decided to proceed to the King James Bible. There, at least, I would find the eternal certainties on which I need to rely.The KJV uses less 30 times. And it uses fewer once. Here's the line:And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit. Numbers 33v54That's it. God uses fewer even fewer times than Shakespeare.So, where are we? Common usage, Shakespeare and God all seem to work the same way and have the same rule hanging around in the background. You can't use fewer for amount. But you can use less for number if you feel like it. And you can get away with not using fewer at all.I realise that this is a surprising conclusion and that governments may fall, riots break out in the deserts and the earth fall from its orbit into the sun. But I couldn't care fewer. I hereby pronounce ex cathedra linguae anglorum that \"10 Items or Less\" is Absolutely Fine.And for those of you interested either in the philosophy of mathematics or the works of Brett Easton Ellis, consider this: Fewer than Zero.*Seriously. I was in a car that broke down somewhere near Abu Dhabi, and there wasn't much else to do."},
{"title": "Sherlock Holmes and Modernism", "date": "Wednesday 1 January 2014", "text": "I do love pretending that this blog is topical, sprinting at the avant garde of the cutting edge, and as there's a new series of the new Sherlock Holmes starting tonight, I thought I'd write about the original Sherlock Holmes and how he relates to Modernism.The Modernists were a bunch of different artists and thinkers and the like in the very late 19th and first half of the 20th Century. One of their Big Ideas was that the city was fragmented, which is a much simpler notion than it sounds. The idea was that back at the beginning of the C19th almost everybody had lived simple rural lives in simple rural villages - the sort of place where everybody knows everybody. If you ever do see a stranger walking through town, you're bound to find out who he is by the end of the day because everybody will talk about him. If you hear a scream in the middle of the night, you can wake up the next morning and ask people what happened. If you see a hat lying at the side of the road, you pick it up and find out who it belongs to.But then, over the course of the C19th, almost everybody moved to the city, and the city did their heads in. In the city you would see strangers all the time, nothing but strangers. And you would never find out where they had come from, or where they were going. You would be woken by a scream from the next street, but you would never find out who was screaming or what about. You would see people fighting down the alleyway, and you didn't know them, you didn't know what they were fighting about, you didn't stop to find out who won. You would see a hat lying on the pavement and you would never know to whom it belonged.All you had in the city was fragments. The Modern world was, as T.S. Eliot put it, a heap of broken images. You got a paragraph of a story, but you never learned the beginning or the end. The Modernists decided that this was the Big Change in the way people lived their lives: specifically they thought that the human mind couldn't cope with it. This idea is all over Modernist novels - the unknown strangers at the funeral in Ulysses, or passing Von Aschenbach on the street, or wandering through the Waste Land. Indeed, the Waste Land opens with meaningless fragments from some trip to the Hoffgarten. I shan't go on about this. If you're interested, I heartily recommend Christopher Butler's Early Modernism.The point about all this is Sherlock Holmes. To Sherlock Holmes, there are no fragments. To Sherlock Holmes, there are no strangers. The signature action of Sherlock Holmes is his ability to tell a visitor his whole biography after a mere glance, as he does at the opening of almost every tale. All stories are completed for him. There are no more fragments.This is why we remember Sherlock Holmes much more than we remember any particular crime that he solves. Sherlock Holmes is a vision of how modern man can cope with the modern city. He is an idea and an ideal. Through Sherlock Holmes the Modern Condition of fragments and incomplete stories is vanquished. He is another way of looking at the city.Sherlock Holmes is not a crime-solver, that is incidental. He is an idea. He is the Messiah who can save us all from Modernism. Now whether that's actually possible is beside the point, just as it's beside the point to wonder whether the rural idylls of the early C19th ever really existed like that. The point is the idea. The point is that if Leopold Bloom or Eliot had had Sherlock by their sides there would have been no Ulysses and no Waste Land, just a comprehensible, coherent and complete world. There would have been no Modernism. And for those of you poor souls who have never read the original stories, here is how Sherlock Holmes reacts to a hat left on the pavement. It's from The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle. \"Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?\" \"Only as much as we can deduce.\" \"From his hat?\" \"Precisely.\" \"But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?\" \"Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?\" I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials \"H. B.\" were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat- securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink. \"I can see nothing,\" said I, handing it back to my friend. \"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.\" \"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?\" He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. \"It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,\" he remarked, \"and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.\" \"My dear Holmes!\" \"He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,\" he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. \"He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.\" \"You are certainly joking, Holmes.\" \"Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?\" \"I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?\" For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. \"It is a question of cubic capacity,\" said he; \"a man with so large a brain must have something in it.\" \"The decline of his fortunes, then?\" \"This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.\" \"Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?\" Sherlock Holmes laughed. \"Here is the foresight,\" said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. \"They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.\" \"Your reasoning is certainly plausible.\" \"The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, gray dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.\" \"But his wife -- you said that she had ceased to love him.\" \"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection.\" \"But he might be a bachelor.\" \"Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg.\" \"You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?\" \"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow -- walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gasjet. Are you satisfied?\""},

Their Christmas is spent overrun by  flying Christmas beetles which swarm between their dangling corks. The fun verbal aspect of this, is that we have Christmas beetles in the Northern Hemisphere too, or as close as dammit. We don't call them Christmas beetles. The British version is called a May bug, and the American version is called a June bug. They're all approximately the same thing (and remember I'm an etymologist, not an entomologist), and the names are essentially the same, it is merely the hemisphere and climate that vary. The May bug is also known as the May beetle, May chafer, billy witch, spang beetle, furze owl, humbuzz, cockchafer and lamellicorn.So bad are the Christmas beetles this year that the Australians have become quite maddened and started reporting cricket scores that are wildly improbable and obviously the results of sun-struck fantasy and delusion.

But I couldn't help wondering (when I wasn't warning of the dangers behind the hero) where pantomime came from.Once upon a time, in Ancient Greece, it was observed that actors were mimics (mimos) of everything (pan, as in a panacea or cure-all). Thus an actor was a pantomimos. This was taken into Latin as pantomimus. Some sense of the original meaning survived, as you can see from these lines from 1615:In time No question but he'll prove true Pantomime, To imitate all forms, shapes, habits, 'tires Suiting the Court.There seems to have been a sense that the pantomime actor mimicked things in clumsy gestures. Anyway, the pantomime then became a kind of play, usually rather sneered at. And in the C19th became the Christmas thingyummyjig we British know and love. Now turn around from your computer screen.

Mind you, Britten was a very poetical composer. I even have an anthology (did you know that anthology means bouquet of flowers in Greek?) purely of poems that Britten set to music. When Britten was sixteen he was ill at school and therefore confined to the sickroom. He took with him a copy of The Oxford Book of English Verse, that he had won as a school prize. They wouldn't allow him anything musical as that would only encourage him. So he ruled out staves on a sheet of blank paper and set a medieval poem to music. In his diary he wrote \"Write... \"Hymn to the Virgin\" & a set of variations (1/4 of it) for organ, which are rather rubbish - I rather like the hymn tho'.\"They played it at his funeral. Later on Britten got together with Auden and they wrote an advertising jingle together for the new-fangled telephone (the monopoly on which was owned by the Post Office). Here is what happens when two of the greatest geniuses of the C20th get into catchy advertising. I love the rhyme of \"Moscow\" with \"Phone kiosk-o\"."},

Tele is Greek for distant, and some people, strange people, therefore get angry about teleporting and television because portering and vision are both Latin and therefore shouldn't be mongreled up with Greek.According to these people a televangelist is fine, but a television is Just Awful.

{"title": "Good, Best, Well", "date": "Tuesday 5 November 2013", "text": "A while ago I wrote a little post about the verb go and its past participle went. I go. I went. I have gone. It looks like a highly irregular verb, but it's not. It's two different verbs - wend and go - that have been forced together. There's an even more complex and more common example. There used to be a word boot. It meant profit, use, advantage. It could be a verb:What boots it with incessant careTo tend the homely, slighted shepherd's trade?Or it could be an adjective:When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,I all alone beweep my outcast stateAnd trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries...It's not that Shakespeare's cries lacked footwear, it's just that they were profitless, useless and brought no advantage.Anyway, the comparative of boot the adjective was bettra (more advantageous) and the superlative was betst (most advantageous/useful etc). Do you see where this is going?Meanwhile, there was the Old English word gōd (which had nothing to do with the word god). It meant... well it meant good. And now we spell it good. It meant virtuous or valid or desirable. Meanwhile, there was another Old English word: will. It meant to desire or want. When things turned out as you had willed them, they turned out well.So now English has a thoroughly weird looking adjective: good, better, best; with the adverb well. We call it irregular, but in a way it's not. It's just three different words that all meant roughly the same thing. Some day, a thousand years from now it may be cool, finer, ok. And people may say to themselves 'That's strange. I wonder how it goed from one to the other.\"In other news, I shall be giving a talk in Abingdon tomorrow. More information here.

It's upside down and vice versa and, peculiarly, head over heels (which is a strange re-ordering of the original heels over head).But why do movie trailers not trail after the film? Why do they trail first?Well, this article seems to have the answer. They used to come after the film. It's the old trick of the series. At the end of one episode you have a trailer for the next one. Here is the cliffhanger, and here the promise of resolution. Here's a description of how it worked in 1912:One of the concessions hung up a white sheet and showed the serial \"The Adventures of Kathlyn.\" At the end of the reel Kathlyn was thrown in the lion's den. After this \"trailed\" a piece of film asking Does she escape the lion's pit? See next week's thrilling chapter! Hence, the word \"trailer,\" an advertisement for a coming picture.But before and after became blurred. Cinemas would show a film, then the trailers, then another film, then the trailers, then another film. So whether you considered them to be before or after simply depended on when you happened to wander into the cinema."},

{"title": "Gone, In My Fashion", "date": "Monday 28 October 2013", "text": "I took a stroll this morning to survey the scene of waste and desolation that was once London. The lush forests of Exmouth Market are no more. There was even a bin blown over. Yet amid all this I kept thinking about the connection between Cole Porter and \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\"Let us start with Cole Porter and his song Always True To You (In My Fashion). It's a funny song about a girl who will sleep with any rich man, and yet assures her boyfriend that she is always sort of true to him in her fashion. A typical verse goes:There's an oil man known as Tex Who is keen to give me checks, And his checks, I fear, mean that sex is here to stay! But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion, Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way.Those last two lines end each verse. Where did Cole Porter get this idea? There was an 1890s poet called Ernest Dowson, who wrote a much sadder and more serious poem called Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae*. In it he describes spending a night with a prostitute in order to try and forget the girl he loves who has left him. Here are the first two verses:Last night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mineThere fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shedUpon my soul between the kisses and the wine;And I was desolate and sick of an old passion,    Yea, I was desolate and bowed my head:I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.All night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,Night-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;Surely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,    When I awoke and found the dawn was grey:I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.Cole Porter's song is essentially a parody of this poem. Poor Dowson! Dead at 33. His most famous line \"The days of wine and roses\" is best known as the title of a 1962 film. And his sad refrain is best known as a jolly comedy.But how does this relate to the windswept remains of London? Well, here's the second half of the poem. I shall simply put the relevant words in bold. I have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,Flung roses, roses riotously with the throng,Dancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind,But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,    Yea, all the time, because the dance was long:I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion. I cried for madder music and for stronger wine,But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,Then falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;And I am desolate and sick of an old passion,    Yea, hungry for the lips of my desire:I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashionErnest Dowson also invented the word soccer. The end is upon us.*Since you ask, this is a line from Horace. It means I am not what I was in the reign of good Cynara, and the context is that he's too old for love. Cynara is some ex-girlfriend. Mind you, cynara is also Greek for artichoke. So it may be about fruit and veg."},

But papa is so disagreeable.\"\"A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.\"\"And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good,\" added Kitty.Thus Jane Austen in Pride and Prejudice. Well, I am going to Brighton on Friday to give a talk on The Elements of Eloquence, after which I shall probably elope with someone unsuitable. Elope is a lovely word, especially if you leap into an elopement with an interloper. There are a whole bunch of lope-words spread around the languages of Northern Europe and they all mean pretty much the same thing: a stride, a run, a jump, a leap, a bound. There was Old English hleapan, and Dutch lopen, and Gothic hlaupan etc. It's therefore very hard to tell where exactly elope comes from, but aloper is first found in French. Meanwhile, somebody who runs in where he's not wanted is an interloper. He probably lopes along, and then leaps. There used to be a punishment in the Swedish army for Very Naughty Soldiers. Basically, all the other soldiers would form two rows, leaving a long narrow passage between them. The Very Naughty Soldier would then have to run down the passage, or gata, whilst all the other soldier tried to hit him as hard as they could. This was called the street-run or gat-lopp. But gatlopp sounds strange in English so we twisted it around and called it running the gauntlet. Finally, there was once a proper bit of a proper wedding in Old English called the Brydlop, which literally means Bride-Run, where the wife hurried off to her new home.If you're in Brighton, do come along.The Inky Fool was reluctant to give his speech"},
{"title": "The Elements of Eloquence", "date": "Wednesday 16 October 2013", "text": "My new book, The Elements of Eloquence, is currently being printed somewhere in darkest, deepest Sussex and will arrive in the bookshops in early November.It's not about etymology, and it's not about strange words. It's about the figures of rhetoric.The figures of rhetoric were a series of formulas devised by the Ancient Greeks for writing beautiful, memorable lines. They weren't plucked out of nothing, of course. They started out by looking at lines that were already famous and seeing what they had in common. So you take:Bond, James Bond.And you wonder to yourself why it's such a famous line. It is, after all, just a chap's name. It doesn't actually say anything more than \"My name is Mr James Bond\". It just says it better. Why? Well, then you take:To be or not to beAnd you wonder why Shakespeare didn't say \"Whether or not to be\". Would have said the same thing. And then you take:O captain! My captain!Crisis? What crisis?Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.Yeah, baby, yeah!Events, dear boy. Events.Fly, my pretties! Fly!And you start to see a pattern. In fact, you can't believe that you never noticed the pattern before. But that's only because the phrases were never stacked up next to each other like that. The Ancient Greeks noticed that pattern: this-that-this. They called it diacope. Unfortunately, the figures of rhetoric don't get taught in schools any more. They used to be. Shakespeare would have had to learn them all by heart. But now, they're largely unknown. So I wrote a book.The Elements of Eloquence has one chapter on each figure, showing how it works, what effects it can have, and what lines it has made famous. It'll be in the shops on the 7th of November (in Britain that is). I hope you like it, dear reader, I hope you like it.And such a pretty cover."},
{"title": "A Scintillating Scintilla", "date": "Friday 11 October 2013", "text": "Once upon a time, there was a Latin noun scintilla and it meant spark. We all know what a spark is: it's the tiny little point of light that flies out of fire or fusebox. And because sparks are so tiny we got the English word scintilla, meaning tiny little thing, which is usually used in phrases like not a scintilla of doubt. But the Romans also made a verb of scintilla: scintillare, which meant to sparkle. And the past participle of scintillare was scintillatus. And because things that sparkle are bright and interesting and attract our attention, we got the verb scintillate. So one word came from the size of a spark, and the other from its brightness. But scintilla has one third child who's not nearly as obvious. As the Roman Empire fell and declined, people forgot how to spell properly and some people changed scintilla to stincilla. That's why the French ended up with a verb estenceler meaning to decorate something with lots of sparkly things. And so Medieval English got the verb stencellen meaning to decorate with bright colours. And that's why the pattern that you use to apply decorations is called a stencil. Not a scintilla of scintillation.Sorry for the lacunose blogging. The new book has now finally been sent to the printers. Of which much, much more soon.And hence, of course, Banksy"},

{"title": "Bonny and Buxom", "date": "Monday 30 September 2013", "text": "Just a repost today, as I went to a wedding at the weekend, and am still deep in finishing The Book. In Medieval wedding services the wife would promise the following:I take thee, John, to be my wedded husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer and poorer, in sickness and health, to be bonny and buxom, in bed and at board, till death do us part, and thereto I plight thee my troth. Now, this seems to our modern eyes to be a strange sort of promise. How could a wife guarantee that she would be buxom? Were thin women unable to marry in church? However, the word buxom has changed in meaning over the years. The first citation of buxom in the OED comes from the twelfth century and is defined as: Obedient; pliant; compliant, tractable. The sense then changed to happy, then to healthy, and thence to plump. Meanwhile bonny comes from the French bon and the Latin bonus, both of which mean good. So a bonny and buxom wife was a good and obedient one, which is why it was eventually replaced by loving, honouring and obeying. There's even a sixteenth century reference to being \"bonnaire and buxome to the Pope\". Anyway, this form of the service is still occasionally used. There's a story about it here."},
{"title": "Sluts, Slags and Pantaloni", "date": "Monday 23 September 2013", "text": "It seems that semantic shifts are now headline news. For those of you not in the UK, politics now rests upon the shifting usage of the word \"slut\". This is because a politician by the name of Godfrey Bloom decided to call some ladies \"sluts\". He was then rather astonished when the press picked up on this and even went so far as to ask my poor dear sister-in-law (who's a journalist) \"Hasn't your mother ever called you a slut?\"His explanation for all this is that he was using slut to mean untidy woman as opposed to lascivious woman, and that this was the True Meaning. As his press secretary put it, journalists \"don't understand the difference between 'slut' and 'slag'. That's a lack of grammar school education.\"Before we go any further, we should get some facts straight:1) Slut did once mean untidy woman. That's the first recorded meaning back in 1402. In fact, I've even written about the old meaning before.2) Slut is first recorded as lascivious woman in 1450. This does not count as a peculiarly modern usage, even by my standards. 3) Both usages were still going strong in the C19th.4) The OED has no citations of slut in either sense later than 1894, which is jolly unhelpful, but see below.5) There is no recorded usage of the word slag as lascivious lady until 1958.I shan't make any jokes about the perils of a grammar school education, although it is rather tempting. Now, as I understand it (and I rarely understand anything in the news), Mr Bloom is saying that back when he was a lad slut meant untidy woman almost exclusively. That you could happily go up to a strange lady and call her a slut and no sexual inference would be taken. Her husband, if he were standing by, would say something like \"Well you don't dust nearly as much as you could\". Or something like that. This is checkable. Mr Bloom was born in November 1949. Assuming usual child development he wouldn't have started talking until the 1950s. So I scuttled off to Google Book search, where you can search to see how a particular word was used in any given year.So I searched for slut in 1953, 63, 73, 83, 93 and 2003, miserably aware of what it would do to my Google Suggested Pages*. Then I went through the first few pages of search results for each year, noting down any usage whose meaning was clear. I ignored, of course, reprints, historical novels et cetera. This isn't exhaustive, but it gives a good representative sample. Every single damned one was sexual.Here are some samples:1953 \"what do I care for the fornications of a slut?\" 1963\"But that wasn't enough punishment for that lewd slut ! I am sure she bedded with Tong, even after that fool of a Kou had made her his second lady.\" 1973\"Your mother's not a slut? That truck comes at night to honk the horn, eh? Not a whore?\" \"the boys around here say l'm a slut, but l'm not — I'm really a virgin.\" 1983 There is something other than a difference in the cognitive content between the word pairs: slut and daughter of joyShe would have intercourse with men in a rather indiscriminate way and then would hate herself for this, saying that she was just a \"slut\" and \"should be dead.\" And so on and so forth. The one and only exception I found was in 1993, in a book called Good Girls Don't Wear Trousers.Before I go any further, let me tell you the local definition of a slut; it isn't a woman who sells her body to a rich, demanding man. Here, a slut is any woman who doesn't dress of behave in the way that is considered proper. Not that women like this are, by definition, promiscuous - in fact they hardly ever have a chance. I thought, when I found that, that I had exonerated Mr Bloom, and could write a reassuring letter to my sister-in-law. But, Alas! It's not in English. Good Girls Don't Wear Trousers is the English translation of Volevo I Pantaloni, and the village slut is... well I can't be bothered to buy the original book and find out... it's something in Italian. There may have been untidy sluts in the last sixty years, but I didn't find them.So... well... I 'm afraid that Mr Bloom must have been brought up in a rather eccentric home, if he was brought up at all. He must also have lived an almost monastic life of solitude and retreat from the world, as if you do go around cheerily using the word slut to all and sundry, you tend to get your face punched in. It's rather like... actually, that's a fantastic idea. I'm going to buy a newspaper and then print a massive front page headline:DAVID CAMERON IS GAY! And then underneath, the small-print article will say.David Cameron is feeling carefree. A Downing Street spokesman confirmed last night that the Prime Minister was filled with joie de vivre and bonhomie...There is, though, an old word for an untidy room - a sluttery. The OED has one citation from 1841.A pre-1958 slag*I was once researching some local history. I found an old map on which the King's Cross Road was marked as \"Black Mary's Hole\". Curious, I decided to Google it. I actually crossed myself before clicking Search. As it turned out, the very first search result was an article about the history of the Kings Cross Road."},

An aposiopesis is a breaking off in mid...I'm afraid I've been terribly busy finishing off my new book, which I've completed in a furious shturmovshchina. It's all about the flowers of rhetoric and should be out in November. Anyway, I'm exhausted so I shall merely post a link to this article on authors and their favourite words. I'd never noticed quite how much Shakespeare used the word sweet. A little point that I'd to add the article is that writers also have words that they absolutely hate. Shakespeare hated the word also. He did use it, but only 36 times in his complete works. That's less than once per play. To give a little comparison, Francis Bacon would sometimes use the word that many times in a single essay. Also, Shakespeare usually puts also in the mouths of low and foolish characters: five of those alsos are said by Fluellen, in Henry V, four by Falstaff, three by Sir Hugh Evans, and two by Dogberry also. I don't have any idea why Shakespeare didn't like also. But if the hatred was good enough for him, it's good enough for me. Or, as the Katherine of Valois puts it in her mangled English in Henry V:Den it sall also content me.Also, I've just checked in the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. It's a big, thick dictionary with over 17,000 famous lines. It also has an index at the back so you can look them up by word. Only two quotations contain the word also. That's a pretty astonishing result. Shakespeare must have been on to something. Update: It's occurred to me that they also serve who only stand and wait [tables]. For some reason that's not listed in the ODQ's index. Hmm.Well he shouldn't have done."},
{"title": "The Owl Jacket", "date": "Friday 6 September 2013", "text": "Back when I was writing The Horologicon, there was one word that I desperately wanted to include. But I couldn't because I didn't remember what it was. I could only remember what it meant.Years ago, I was chatting to an Italian lady and she told me a strange story of Italy. She told me that sometimes, when Italian men bought a suit, they would buy two jackets. One of these jackets was for wearing as you stroll around town drinking delicious espressos and wooing beautiful women and generally being Italian. Meanwhile the other jacket was hanging over the back of your chair at work, so that it looked as though you were in the office. I loved this tale. I adored the idea of putting such thought into shirking. I dreamed of doing the same sort of thing in rainy London. But what I loved most of all was that there was a particular word for that jacket. There was a word meaning the-jacket-left-hanging-over-the-back-of-your-chair-in-the-office-while-you're-gallivanting-around-town. That's a good word.That's a word that I wanted to include in The Horologicon. There's a whole chapter of that book devoted to sneaking out of the office and that word was going to be the centrepiece. But I couldn't remember what it was. I went mad. I racked my brain until I could rack no more. I e-mailed every Italian I knew and asked them about it. Every single one of them had heard of the practice of leaving-a-jacket-hanging-over-the-back-of-your-chair-in-the-office-while-you're-gallivanting-around-town. But they all said they'd never heard of a word for it. It was just a thing you did. And in the end - miserable and humiliated - I was forced to give up. And then, a couple of days ago, a year after The Horologicon went off to the printers, I got an e-mail from the Inky Fool's correspondent in Rome. Dear Mark,Yesterday I was watching a very old fun&depressing-at-the-same-time Italian film and the protagonist suddenly mentioned that jacket you had asked me about a year ago. The famous jacket the Italians leave on the chair in order to pretend to be working while they are out of the office doing all sorts of things. And the name of that jacket is lovely, in my opinion. It is \"Giacca civetta\" which means \"Owl jacket\" I believe that generally \"civetta\" in Italian means, amongst other things, something which can attract and deceive too. But you are the expert of this kind of things, I am only trying to guess. So, after one year, here is your answer. I don't think I really am an expert on the subtle symbolism of Italian birds, and my correspondent is a native of that fair peninsula, so she should know. However, I will add that it works beautifully in English because owls perch silently in corners. So the jacket perched on your chair is - I pronounce this ex cathedra linguae Anglorum - the Owl Jacket.I don't know how effective this is if you work at home."},
{"title": "Kubla Khan", "date": "Monday 2 September 2013", "text": "Coleridge always claimed that Kubla Khan came to him as a dream-vision, and that he never put any conscious thought into it. He also claimed that there was a lot more of it in the dream, but that he was interrupted halfway through writing it by a businessman from Porlock, and that as a result it was unfinished. This is clearly a bunch of nonsense. For a start, the ending is definitely an ending. And secondly the poem contains so many intricate details that the idea that anybody dreams like that is, frankly, preposterous. Fifty-four lines of  perfect rhymes would be astonishing by anybody's standards. But what I happened to notice today was the alliteration. It's all over the poem, of course, \"A mighty fountain momently was forced\" and \"Five miles meandering with a mazy motion\". But I noticed that, usually, it's concentrated on the last two words of the line. Take the opening:In Xanadu did Kubla KhanA stately pleasure-Dome Decree:Where Alph, the sacred River, RanThrough caverns Measureless to ManDown to a Sunless Sea.It's regular enough that it's almost part of the verse form: the iambic tetrameter with alliterative ending. Then it disappears for the next twenty lines before starting again in the second half of the poem. In total 15 of the 54 lines end alliteratively. This can't be coincidence. A quick look at Recantation, which is the next poem in my edition of Coleridge, doesn't have a single one in the first thirty lines. To work thus did the Khan commute."},

This is a dangerous way to order your meal, although scorpion fish turns out to be delicious. Some restaurants, of course, had menus in English for linguistically incapable people like me. But these can be just as mysterious. The Es Turo restaurant had a starter which was called, in English, Marjorcan Pluck. This puzzled me for a while. Was it Majorcan bravery that I would get? Or left over chicken feathers? So I ordered it on the basis that daring is the better part of gastronomy. When it arrived I suddenly realised that English etymology would have told me what it was. I really had got a plate of Marjorcan bravery, or, more precisely, Marjorcan guts.Pluck is an old term for the innards, which are plucked out of an animal when it's butchered. Some brave people have heart, some have balls, but most have guts, or to use a synonym pluck. Thus people who are brave are gutsy, or plucky.

I simply thought that it was as amusing as it was annoying. It certainly shows the silliness of web-filtering, but, to be honest, I was more motivated by the constant failures of the British Library wifi, which have been driving all who work there to distraction for a couple of years, and of which this seemed a particularly preposterous example.So I shall do nothing more etymological today than to mention that, according to the OED, the silly season was first recorded in 1861.

If you like, you can hear me on the Guardian Books Podcast chatting to the lovely Claire Armitstead. Yet what intrigued me most was a lady at the book signing who told me about the word flype. Flype, she said, was a Scots word meaning to roll back a sock or stocking prior to putting it on one's foot. Well, I have to say, that I didn't quite know whether to believe her. It sounded too good to be true, and I was away from my dictionaries. So the first thing I did upon hurtling back down to London was to look it up. And yes: flype (or flipe) means just that.Merriam Webster has this:1chiefly Scot   : to strip off by or as if by peeling  2chiefly Scot   : to turn or fold back (as a stocking)  The OED, though, shows that, though flyping is now chiefly Scots, its earliest citations are English.

{"title": "Don't Feed the Troll Fishers", "date": "Friday 9 August 2013", "text": "I've been reading Netymology by Tom Chatfield. It's all about the etymology of computer terms. Thus I have discovered that trolls do not come from Scandinavia and lurk under bridges. They come from almost everywhere else. Sort of.The verb troller first appears in Medieval French. It meant going out hunting without having any specific animal in mind. Imagine, if you will, a medieval Frenchman wandering through a wood with a bow and arrow and shooting any animal he felt like. That verb came straight into English as to troll. So Piers Plowman has:And þus hath he trolled forth þis two & thretty winter.And Bryan Ferry has:Aggravated. Spare for days.I troll down-town, the red light placeIn fact, the OED specifically mentions that troll became gay slang for cruising. But trolling also kept its non-metaphorical hunting sense with troll fishing. This is when you just attach a baited line to the back of your boat and sail around in the vague hope that something will bite.This is one of those classic cases where the word could have come from trolling, and could have come from trailing, and probably came from both. It's just so convenient that the words sound alike. So whether a trollnet was really a trawl net or a troll net is hard to say:No Person..withe any..Crele, Rawe, Fagnett, Trollnett..shall take..Spawne or Frye of Eeles, Salmon, Pyke or Pyckerell. (1558)But it does seem to be that sense of throwing out bait and seeing who'll take it that gave us the original Internet trolls. Ask anybody techie and they'll insist that a troll is somebody who posts deliberately provocative comments in an online forum, not because they believe them, but because they want to see who'll get angry, who'll bite. This was the original meaning back in the early nineties. Thus the Toronto Star reported in 1995 that:Posts that are designed to encourage angry responses are called ‘trolls’ because the purpose is to fish for flames.But, of course, far fewer people have heard of troll fishing, or indeed of aimless Frenchmen, that have heard of the nasty Scandinavian creatures that hide under bridges. People soon forgot the original precise meaning of trailing a bait, and that is why, under the influence of the Scandy creature, we now use troll to mean anybody on the Internet who's nasty."},
{"title": "Hamlet is Banned", "date": "Wednesday 7 August 2013", "text": "Because of all the attention this post is getting, I ought to point out that I was not intending to disclose some outrageous Orwellian conspiracy, merely incompetence and inertia. I wrote the post because of 1) The amusing absurdity of the greatest work of British literature being blocked by the British Library. 2) The evident silliness of filtering systems, particularly one that blocks mit.edu but not facebook. 3) The frustration of dealing with institutions that disown their own Internet provider. 4) The miserable truth that over the last couple of years the failures of the BL's wifi - whether broken, slow or filtered - has forced researchers to choose, reluctantly, between books and the Internet.On Monday, I was sitting in the British Library frantically trying to write my new book in a shturmovshchina. I had to quickly check a particular line in Hamlet, so I Googled Hamlet MIT, because the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has put the entire works of Shakespeare up on the Internet. (It takes 70 mins to order a physical book). I clicked on the link and...A message came up from the British Library telling me that access to site was blocked due to \"violent content\". Now, Hamlet is a violent play. I see that. When the curtain comes down there's a lot of bodies on the boards. But...But...I tried it again. It told me that my attempts to access this violent content were being logged. I took my computer over to the information desk, and after I had explained to them what MIT stood for (really), they called the IT department and told them about the webpage that I had been blocked from. http://shakespeare.mit.edu/hamlet/full.htmlThey had to spell out Shakespeare letter by letter. Really. Ess. Aitch. Ay. Kay...I asked them if they were surprised that Hamlet was now banned in the British Library. They shrugged. I asked them how it was that I could still access youtube, facebook and twitter. I asked why the girl at the next desk to me had been able to spend the last half hour on Guardian Soulmates, while the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's website was banned. They shrugged. I asked if they saw the problem, perhaps just the symbolism, of Hamlet being banned in the British Library. They shrugged.The IT department said there was nothing to be done, as it was only the British Library's wifi service that was blocking Hamlet, and the British Library's wifi service, they seemed sure, had nothing to do with the British Library. They were merely ships that passed in the night. Children crying to each other from either bank of an uncrossable river. 'But,' I said. It's one of those points where you just want somebody to understand the central point. 'The British Library has banned Hamlet for being too violent.'And the lady behind the desk nodded and smiled.It's one of those points where I don't know whether they're insane, or if it's me. Maybe Hamlet should be banned. I wrote an angry e-mail, and this morning I got one back saying they're looking into it. But maybe I should give all this up and get a job as a lighthouse keeper. But I fear I'd still have those dreams, those dreams about that man with poison sword and the people fighting in the grave and the venom being poured down my throat. O God!

{"title": "Magazines and Time and Time Magazine", "date": "Monday 5 August 2013", "text": "I'm feeling all uppity today, thanks to Time Magazine's lists of the 25 bloggers of 2013, which for some reason contains me. As a result, it seems appropriate to explain why magazines are called magazines, or more specifically, why they are named after part of a rifle. I turned on the television the other day and in that split second between the sound coming on and the screen warming up I heard a male voice say with the utmost despair \"The magazine! It's empty!\"Now I know a chap who works in the magazine business which probably messed with my mind on the subject, but my immediate understanding of the line was that too many journalists had missed their deadlines and that they weren't going to put the issue to bed (lovely phrase) in time for the printers. The voice sounded approximately as panicked as my acquaintance would be in these circumstances.   Then the screen warmed up and I saw an actor inspecting his gun.So what was the connection? Once upon a time there was an Arabic word khazana meaning to store up. From that they got makhzan meaning storehouse and its plural makhazin. That word sailed northward across the Mediterranean (the middle of the earth) and became the Italian magazzino, which then proceeded by foot to France and magasin, before jumping into the back of a lorry and getting into Britain as magazine, still retaining its original meaning of storehouse, usually military. Then along came Edward Cave.Edward Cave wanted to print something periodically that would contain stuff on any subject that might be of interest to the educated of London, whether it be politics or gardening or the price of corn. He cast around for a name for his new idea and decided to call it the Gentleman's Magazine: or, Trader's monthly intelligencer. So far as anyone can tell (and in the absence of a seance we can only guess at Mr Cave's thought process) he wanted to imply that this the information in his publication would arm the gentleman intellectually, or perhaps he wanted to imply that it was a storehouse of information. Anyway, he dropped the monthly intelligencer bit and by 1759 he was publishing this:Cave's arms depot of information was a great success, not least because he employed a young and penniless chap called Samuel Johnson. But if, dear reader, Cave had decided instead to drop the magazine bit instead, we might all now be buying intelligencers. Thus Cave's caprice altered English. Porn mags might have been called carnal intelligencers and that, I am sure, would make the world a Better Place. And my acquaintance wouldn't be working for part of a gun."},

It's the word scumbag, which is thrown around as though it's not at all obscene. People seem to have forgotten rather quickly that scum is semen and a scumbag is a condom.

The whole shebang. A shebang was a nineteenth century American word for a log cabin and then for a tavern. Then it came to mean a kind of cart in which you could hire a seat. Of course, you could hire the whole shebang. So in a story of 1880 a traveller is told that he has a seat specially reserved for him:\"...the box seat was purchased by that other gentleman in Sacramento. He paid extra for it, and his name's on your way-bill!\" \"That,\" said Yuba Bill, scornfully, \"don't fetch me even ef he'd chartered the whole shebang. Look yar, do you reckon I'm goin' to spile my temper by setting next to a man with a game eye? And such an eye! Gewhillikins!\"And so the whole shebang came to mean the entirety of something usually only dealt with in parts, and thus the modern usage.Mind you, nobody really knows where the original word came from: perhaps Irish shebeen for tavern, or French char-a-banc for cart.Part of the shebang"},

{"title": "Terms of Engagement", "date": "Friday 19 July 2013", "text": "Rob Colvile gave the Inky Fool a mention in his Telegraph column yesterday. He was referring to a post from 2009 by Mrs Malaprop and how it had influenced his proposal of marriage. So I may as well repost it now. Saturday's Times carried a letter in which some \"matrons in the Shires\" took issue with Giles Coren's references to his \"girlfriend\", when the pair had already announced their engagement. \"Esther is rather more than a \"girlfriend\" now,\" they chided, the inference being that her future husband ought to acknowledge her instead as his fiancée . Mr Coren's response was short and eloquent: \"Yes, but 'fiancée' is such a horrid word...\". The word \"fiancé(e)\" is one which evokes strong emotions, not all of them romantic. As long ago as 1949, the novelist Angela Thirkell wrote testily about \"the dreadful word fiancée...what we can do about it we really do not know\".  What can we do about it? Some people, like the columnist above, avoid it altogether and refer to their girlfriend or boyfriend as just that until they are married. Some accommodate it through feats of mispronunciation - like my colleague who pronounces it to rhyme with séance - while others reach for the thesaurus and dust off alternatives such as betrothed or intended.  What puzzles me is why it causes such awkwardness. I have seen it accused of being pretentious and of sounding like a \"middle manager at a high street bank\". But the most probable explanation is that, as a French loan word which has not been anglicised* in any way, it sounds strained and unnatural in English. It may also carry a whiff of genteelism, if the example of other French borrowings like \"serviette\" is anything to go by. * One of the posters here refers to her father, who in \"inimitable West Virginia fashion\" pronounced the word as “fi-ancy” (\"fi\" as in hi-fi). To me, this sounds much better. In other, unrelated news, Mrs Malaprop is now engaged."},
{"title": "George Eliot and Lady Novelists", "date": "Wednesday 17 July 2013", "text": "J.K. Rowling, it turns out, is Robert Galbraith. Or vice versa, I'm bad at keeping up with such things. And so people keep repeating the old canard that Mary Anne Evans had to change her name to George Eliot in order to be published. I was told about this at school, and I've heard it since, and it's complete nonsense. If you want to know why Mary Anne Evans changed her name the best thing to do is to read an essay by a woman called Mary Anne Evans, which was published, importantly, under her real name.The essay is called Silly Novels by Lady Novelists and you can read the whole thing here. I recommend it. It's a good essay (for a woman, you understand). But for those of you who can't be bothered I shall summarise.1) Female novelists are almost all crap. (Remember these are George Eliot's thoughts, not mine. I love a bit of Muriel Spark). The novels they produce are almost all idiotic.2) The reason for this is that the literary world is too kind to lady novelists. They let them write any old drivel and then review it well, just because they're women.3) If people were nastier to lady novelists, maybe lady novelists would improve.4) The greatest compliment that can be paid to a lady novelist is to be harshly reviewed (as Gaskell was).The essay was published in 1856, when Mary Anne Evans was working on the Westminster Review. It was published under her own name. Three years later she published Adam Bede under the name George Eliot. There were other reasons for a name change. Mary's private life was odd even by today's standards and pretty bloody freaky by Victorian ones. She therefore didn't want to draw attention to herself. But the reason for picking a male pseudonym is very clearly explained in Silly Novels by Lady Novelists.No. It's by Mary Anne Evans."},
{"title": "Much Ado and the Missing Duel", "date": "Monday 15 July 2013", "text": "I went to see Joss Whedon’s (excellent) film of Much Ado about Nothing recently, and when we left the cinema everybody starting making the same comments everybody makes after seeing Much Ado: Benedick and Beatrice are great, Dogberry’s funny, Hero and Claudio are really dull and should probably be cut.The second complaint (always voiced by girls) is that Claudio doesn’t deserve to be forgiven. General female opinion seems to be that if a chap promises to marry you and then gets to the altar, calls you a whore and storms out, he has to do rather more to be forgiven than sing a bloody song.I have a theory that explains all this. My theory is that Much Ado is an artistic failure. I mean, I love the play. I adore it but… let me explain. First, you’ve got to understand the basic structure of Much Ado. The plot is about Hero and Claudio. They meet. They fall in love. He thinks she’s betrayed him. They split up. He finds he’s wrong. They get back together. That is the fundamental story of the play.There is a sub-plot about Benedick and Beatrice. But it is only a sub-plot. You could take both characters out and the play would still be complete. By which I mean it would have a beginning, a middle and an end, and make sense. Of course, any director who did cut them would be crazy, as they have all the best lines. But from a narrative point of view you could. The sub-plot doesn’t even feed into the main Claudio-Hero story.There is Dogberry. From a narrative point of view he’s almost irrelevant. Two lines would suffice. “You’re under arrest” and “My Lord, this man traduced you daughter. He can explain how.” In fact, he doesn’t even need those two. You could do a performance where the watch simply leapt out and grabbed the baddies. Then later they could lead Borachio in in silence, point a sword at him and let him explain. You could cut all Dogberry’s lines. Of course, any director who did cut them would be crazy, they’re comedy gold. But from a narrative point of view Dogberry is a near-irrelevance.Now, Shakespeare knew about plots and story-telling. Shakespeare knew that Hero and Claudio were the main story, but he got so interested in Beatrice and Benedick that he lost interest in his main characters. They get good lines. Hero and Claudio get passed over. You can even see this happening plotwise. The whole he-wooed-her-in-his-name-not-mine story is set up very carefully and then… just kind of forgotten about and tied up in a couple of lines of “No I didn’t. She’s yours.” Shakespeare had something more planned there. He just couldn’t be bothered to write it. He was having much too much fun with Beatrice and Benedick.And then comes Dogberry. The second Dogberry appears two thirds of the way through the play, Beatrice and Benedick don’t get any more good lines. Shakespeare lost interest in them. Suddenly you get (wonderful) extended comic scenes of Dogberry’s foolishness. Getting so interested in subplots and minor characters that you forget about your main plot and main characters is an artistic mistake. But that’s what Shakespeare did. He wrote for B&B and then for Dogberry and forgot about everything else. Indeed, I think he forgot to write the main scene of the play. Remember the duel that Benedick and Claudio were going to fight? It doesn’t happen. It’s carefully set up. Right from the beginning. We establish that Benedick and Claudio are both soldiers. We establish that they’re best friends. Then the two friends fall in love with two girls. All is good until one of them falls out with his girl. The friends are now turned to enemies. Benedick challenges Claudio to a duel. And…In the climactic scene of the play they meet and fight the duel. Beatrice watches with heart in mouth. Hero watches secretly from a window. Benedick does well at first but then Claudio beats him, knocks away his sword and is about to kill his best friend. But he can’t do it. Or maybe Beatrice shouts stop. Or a messenger runs in with the news about Borachio. I’m a bit sketchy here. Claudio is redeemed. The marriages are back on. And the Benedick-Beatrice plot actually gets connected to, and becomes a vital part of, the whole story. Either way, Claudio suffers and is redeemed and Benedick fights and is connected to the story.There was even a duel in the source material. In Orlando Furioso Canto V, from which Shakespeare nabbed most of the plot, they pull out their swords and have a fight. I’m utterly convinced that that was where Shakespeare was going. Everything leads up to it. All the ground has been prepared. But then poor Will got so distracted writing great lines for Dogberry that he couldn’t be bothered anymore and decided to clear it all up with a song and a second wedding.The result is a play that is great fun to watch because Dogberry and B&B have such good lines. But it’s an artistic mess and a structural failure. I still love it, of course, and would thoroughly recommend Mr Whedon’s film*. The Inky Fool still didn't tip the waiter.  Odd thing I discovered: Joss Whedon went to Winchester College. To be precise he was in Trants (boarding house). That's the same house as Lord Alfred Douglas, Oswald Mosely, Hugh Gaitskell, and me.﻿"},

You should point out to anyone who'll listen that they were not playing tennis. They were playing sphairistike.Tennis is an old French game named after the command Tenez or Hold that you would shout when you served the ball. It's played in an enclosed court and is nowadays usually referred to as Real Tennis. The game that they are playing at Wimbledon was invented by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield* in 1873, and he named his new sport Sphairistike, which is Ancient Greek for ball skill (sphere-tech). The only reason that it isn't called the Wimbledon Sphairistike Championship is that nobody had the faintest idea how to pronounce sphairistike, and so they quickly gave up and started referring to it as Lawn Tennis. Sphairistike is easy to pronounce, though. It rhymes with sticky. So go forth, dear reader, and every time somebody mentions the tennis, tut and shake your head.No, of sphairistike. *Londoners can see his blue plaque just round the corner from Pimlico Tube Station."},

But my two favourites were idle jacks and twairtle. Idle jacks are the little bits of loose skin around your finger nails: something that I've often had, but never before named. And to twairtle is to fiddle with something. This means that in Derbyshire it must be possible to twairtle with your idle jacks. One curious thing about the book is that it talks of a \"well-known ditty\" that goes:Ah'm a Derbyshire man born and bred,Strong i'th'arm and wick in the head.The book explains that wick here is a variant of quick. Now, I do know that ditty. I've heard it for years. But I've always heard it as:Derbyshire born, Derbyshire bred,Thick in the arm and thick in the head.And that version I learnt in Derbyshire."},

Or at least, that's the small calorie. The large calorie is the one that raises a whole kilogram of water by 1 degree Celsius. The point of all this is that calorie comes from the Latin calor meaning heat. Calor was closely related to calidus, which meant hot. And that's why the Romans called a cooking pot a caldaria. And that's why the French called a cooking pot a cauderon. And that's why the English called a cooking pot a caudron. And then, in the fifteenth century, some Latin scholar pointed out that, etymologically, there should be an L in it, and that's why we call it a cauldron.A cauldron full of calories.

{"title": "Anthea's Anthologies", "date": "Monday 17 June 2013", "text": "Anthos was the Greek for flower. Thus Antheios meant flowery. And thus the goddess Hera, who was often associated with flowers, got the byname Antheia. This name was revived in the seventeenth century by the poet Robert Herrick who wanted a nice classical sounding name for a love poem. So he wrote To Anthea, who may Command Him Anything. It begins:Bid me to live, and I will live     Thy Protestant to be; Or bid me love, and I will give     A loving heart to thee.(Protestant there means one who vows or protests his loyalty).Anyway, anthos has found its way into the language in other words. Chrysanthemums are golden flowers. Acanthuses are thorny flowers. And anthologies are books of flowers. Sometimes anthologies are actual bouquets of flowers. Sometimes anthologies are literal books of flowers. And sometimes anthologies are books of the flowers of literature, the finest poems plucked from the muses' field and collected into one volume. A flower book. And an anthomaniac is somebody who's mad about flowers, or girls called Anthea.Poor Anthea."},

{"title": "Paperbacks and Retronyms", "date": "Friday 7 June 2013", "text": "The paperback of The Etymologicon is released today in Britain. I don't really know why it's a paperback and not a paperfront. In fact, like me, it's soft all round. In the USA they have, occasionally, paperbounds, which make a lot more sense. Paperbacks were introduced in the 1840s to supply the newly literate lower classes with something on which to expend their literacy. They were sometimes called penny-dreadfuls (cost and quality) and sometimes called yellow-backs because they were printed in bright colours (often, as you may have guessed, yellow). Paperback is first recorded in 1843, but hardback isn't recorded until 1954. Well, to be fair hardback was recorded in 1750 as the name of a kind of West Indian coleopterous insect, and in 1883 as the name of a central American fish. But hardback as a kind of book doesn't appear until over a century after paperback, despite the fact that hardbacks were there first. This is a classic example of the retronym. Organic food, live music and acoustic guitars were all there first. However, the introduction of pesticides, records and electric guitars meant that you then had to start specifying. It's something I always consider when travelling on the London Overground. Anyway, if you found your hardback Etymologicon too cruelly granite-like, or if you once had a bad experience with a coleopterous West Indian, you can now rush to the bookshop and ask for something softer."},
{"title": "Fancy Mancy", "date": "Wednesday 5 June 2013", "text": "There are an awful lot of ways of predicting the future. You can, for example, follow the ancient Roman method of observing birds. The Latin for bird was avis, and this, with the V changed to G, appears to be the origin of the augur, the official soothsayer. The augur was summoned whenever a new project was begun, and thus you get inaugurations.However, you can also use fish (ichtiomancy), mirrors (catoptromancy), or fig leaves (sicomancy). Anything you want, really, so long as you know the name. And the best way to learn the names is to read the Mancy chapter in Thomas Urquhart's translation of Rabelais. And the best way to do that is on the fantastic Six Degrees of Sir Thomas Urquhart blog, where the whole chapter has been annotated so you can click on a mancy and get the meaning.The chapter also contains the word sercroupierizing, which means having sex with several people in succession.

{"title": "Jet Lag", "date": "Monday 3 June 2013", "text": "Flotsam is stuff that just floats about, jetsam is stuff that has been jettisoned from a boat, i.e. thrown over board. That's because it comes from the Latin iacare meaning to throw. That's why, when Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon and led his troops into Italy, he said Alea iacta est. It means The dice have been thrown. If you throw out liquid or vapour, it forms a jet of water or steam. (If you throw out a wooden structure from the shore, it forms a jetty). Newtonian physics insists that if you throw out a jet in one direction you will be pushed in the other. This is the principle of the jet engine. The first commercial jet liner was the de Havilland Comet, which first flew in 1949, but didn't start doing business until 1952. It's therefore a trifle surprising that the jet set was first recorded in 1949. However, that's because the jet set was originally just young people who lived fast. As fast as jets. The inevitable result of real, literal jet-setting is jet lag, which was first recorded in 1965. It popped up in the New York Herald Tribune and is described thuslyly:Jet lag strikes suddenly. The victim disembarks from the..plane feeling gay as a sprite, dashes through customs, checks into home or a hotel, .. greets friends and in the course of the next few hours falls into a light coma.Which is why I was up at 5am this morning.

{"title": "Petrichor and Inyinnyi", "date": "Thursday 30 May 2013", "text": "The Sydney Writers' Festival is over and done. They are not long, the days of wine and roses. But if you want to know what they're like you can listen to the delightful and erudite David Astle chatting to me by following this link. After leaving Sydney I went through the old Australian ritual of flyabout and ended up in a gorge in Uluru (or Ayers Rock depending on your persuasion) where I met a delightful novelist called Lia Hills. We immediately fell to talking about strange words. She asked me if I knew the distinctive smell of rain falling on dry ground. I said \"Petrichor\" and started to explain that the word was thought up by two scientists in 1964. They even explained the etymology of the name in an article in Nature:The diverse nature of the host materials has led us to propose the name ‘petrichor’ for this apparently unique odour which can be regarded as an ‘ichor’ or ‘tenuous essence’ derived from rock or stone. This name, unlike the general term ‘argillaceous odour’, avoids the unwarranted implication that the phenomenon is restricted to clays or argillaceous materials; it does not imply that petrichor is necessarily a fixed chemical entity but rather it denotes an integral odour.But it turns out, as with most things in Australia, that the Aborigines got there first. Lia Hills told me the Pitjantjatjara language, which is the local language around the rock, contains the word Inyinnyi (pronounced in-yin-nyi), which means the smell you get when water lands on dry earth. Apparently the elders all know this word, but it is now dying out. Q: How much does Uluru weigh?A: One stone."},

{"title": "Pylons", "date": "Monday 20 May 2013", "text": "This afternoon I climbed a pylon of Sydney Harbour Bridge, and thus this repost on what a pylon is. I shall remind everybody once again that the reason for my upsidedownity and eccentric idea of when this afternoon was is the Sydney Writer's Festival. Do come along if you can. What, dear reader, do these two photographs have in common?Give up? So soon? Ah well, dear reader, you were never one to make an effort, were you? They are both pictures of pylons, for strange and gradual reasons that I shall explain as gently as possible.Once upon a time there was a Greek word pylon that meant gate. It was a dull Greek word that might have died in obscurity were it not for the fine classical education of Egyptologists. They took pylon and decided to use it for the gateways of Egyptian temples. They had already decided to call the entrance to Greek temples the propylaeum.Egyptian temples tend to have the same kinds of gateways. You have two big towers on either side and then a cross-beam between them, as in the illustration that I have so solicitously provided. Things might have stopped there were it not for bridges. In the late nineteenth century people liked to put towers at either end of a bridge: not for any practical purpose, you understand, just because they looked nice. Such pylons can be found on the Pont Alexandre III in Paris. You see the towers at either end? You see how they could be considered like the towers of the Egyptian temples with a crossbeam between? It's tenuous. Almost the first reference that I can find to pylons in this sense comes from the 1901 Baedeker guide to Paris, which describes these very pylons and the statues that perched atop them. The same volume of Baedeker also refers to the obelisk in Paris, and to how it had been taken from the temple of Ramses II at Thebes where it had stood \"in front of a 'pylon', or gateway\".From here, things become a trifle muddied. It is certain that in suspension bridges, which had been around for a century, these pylons were used to hold the cables that held the bridge. However, the OED is extraordinarily unhelpful on this front. I found an architectural dictionary of 1912 that said they were purely decorative. Nonetheless, observe the wonders of Bristol.A pylon if ever I saw oneWhat is certain is that seven years after that Baedeker was written, on the far side of the Atlantic, in North Carolina (near Buncombe country about which I have blogged), the Wright brothers were trying to make their new-fangled airplanes take off. This was troublesome as planes have to gather speed terribly quickly. So they came up with a cunning plan. They built a metal frame tower. At the top of it they had a heavy weight attached by rope to a pulley and thence to the land-loving aircraft. When they dropped the weight the aircraft would be yanked forward giving it the speed required for take off. Here is a picture:The tower was rather useful. It was light and easy to build and terribly importantly it marked where the runway was. Early aviators found this aspect so useful that they would have a line of pylons marking the approach to the runway. Then they got used as markers in airplane races. You would take off, head for a pylon, perform a pylon turn around it and return to the runway. I can't work out whether the Wright Brothers were the first to call this a pylon, but it was in use by 1909 and here's a lovely illustration from a 1912 edition of Popular Mechanics:So now you have lines of frame towers running across the countryside. And from there, dear reader, you get the modern sense, which pops up in 1923 in a novel by Edward Shanks, and by 1930 we finally arrive at the poetry:Power-stations locked, deserted, since they drew the boiler firesPylons falling or subsiding, trailing dead high-tension wires;* So wrote W.H. Auden and three years later Stephen Spender wrote a whole poem called simply \"The Pylons\". So fond were these thirties poets of Egyptian gateways that they were later known as the Pylon School of poetry.     Betjeman, who was not of the Pylon School, reacted thus:    Encase your legs in nylons Bestride your hills with pylons O age without a soul     For myself, I have always been rather fond of pylons. The discipline of structural necessity gives them elegance. They seem like great elegant giants striding single-file across the countryside. If Don Quixote were alive today, I am certain that he would charge them and not windmills.     It is a frailty of the aesthetic sense that people rarely appreciate beauty when it is necessary. The Roman aqueducts that tourists now gawp at would have been eyesores in their time. A hideous necessity cutting across the pastoral valleys. Windmills were once no more picturesque than windfarms, because they were necessary structures.     I was once being talked at by a terrible bore who was explaining how he had done up his horrid little house in the countryside. He had preserved at great expense some old contraption for grinding corn. I was not interested. I was gazing at the line of pylons that waddled magnificently from one horizon to the other. He noticed my inattention, noticed the pylons and said \"Yes, they're horribly ugly, aren't they? Completely ruin the view. But anyway, the corn would have gone in here and then this handle....\"     Which only goes to prove what I have always believed: beauty is utility plus a few hundred years.    The march of the giants   P.S. A pylon can also be an artificial limb, or a prologue.    *The opening chorus of The Dog Beneath the Skin"},

But first more things antipodean.The climax of the Sydney Writer's Festival will fall on the 175-and-a-halfth anniversary of the arrival of Maria Ann Smith in Sydney. Maria lived at Kissing Point in Sydney (well then it was near Sydney, now it's in), where she found an apple growing. The apple had seeded itself from a barrel of crab apples from Tasmania, and it turned out to be rather delicious. Also, its oily skin meant that it would keep longer than most apples. It was cultivated and named after its discoverer. And that is where we get Granny Smith apples from.And now for today's wombat poem. The Victorian poet and painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti ordered a mail-order wombat. You could do that sort of thing in those days. They were heady times for the wombat lover. However, the mail was slow and poor Dante had to wait in impatient expectation for his pet to arrive. This must have been a difficult time for him and he set down his emotions in a poem that went like this:O how the family affections combat Within this heart, and each hour flings a bomb at My burning soul! Neither from owl nor from bat Can peace be gained until I clasp my wombat. I'm not making that up. But most importantly, the wonderful Bookshop Band have turned the Horologicon into a song.

In the meantime, I thought you should have a video about Australian English vs British (based on cricket). And a poem about the wombat. In fact, there's an awful lot of beautiful wombat poetry and I might make it a theme of this week. Wombat comes from the aboriginal Dharuk language, which was spoken in Sydney before Sydney existed. So it's appropriately local. The first reference to the word (1798) has several slightly different pronunciations and spellings. Called by the natives, womat, wombat, or womback, according to the different dialects, or perhaps to the different rendering of the wood rangers who brought the information.And if we hadn't picked the right one, this week's poems would be unwritten, and the world a sadder and less beautiful place.

{"title": "Plumbing with Aplomb", "date": "Wednesday 1 May 2013", "text": "The Latin for lead (the metal, not the advantage) was plumbum, and so there is an obscure English word plumbous, which means leaden or heavy. But the uses of lead are various and so, therefore, are the words that derive from it.The main thing about lead is that it is heavy. If you attach it to a piece of string, the piece of string will hang down perfectly vertically. It takes a strong wind to move lead. What you therefore get is a plumb line, which, combined with a right angle, was terribly useful in building until the spirit level came and took its job away. It's also useful in working out the depth of water, as currents will not sway it much. Therefore one can plumb the depths using a plumb line. The weight will plunge into the water (from Latin plumbicare) and then plummet to the very bottom. The line will remain perfectly upright, or as the French would put it à plomb. If a person were to remain so upright in the currents and whirlpools of life, they would therefore display perfect aplomb. But the other use of lead is that it's wonderfully soft for a metal. You can work it with your hands and it was this advantage that meant that it was used in roofing and then in Victorian water pipes. So universal was the use of lead, that by the 1870s piping was simply known as plumbing. Those who worked in lead had been known as plumbers for centuries, but now they became the people who fixed your taps.The other thing about lead is that it's poisonous.

{"title": "Catachretic Love", "date": "Wednesday 24 April 2013", "text": "There's a rhetorical term called catachresis, which is rather hard to define. That is to say that like most rhetorical terms it has several different definitions that have amassed over a couple of millennia. Some authorities just say that is the misuse of a word - a malapropism. But others have the more interesting definition that it is a word wrenched out of its normal usage in a surprising, impossible metaphor. The classic example of this is Hamlet's \"I will look daggers at her\". This was, of course, the origin of the phrase. Look daggers is the catachresis because... well how can you look daggers. Look isn't even a transistive verb - you look at the cat, you don't look the cat. So shouldn't it really be an adverb like look angrily? Of course it works. It works very well. Indeed it works because it's so damned surprising. Another Shakespearean example is \"Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's pockets\". That means Timon's broke. But it's a metaphor that sort of doesn't work, and therefore works really well. It's a use of language that's so wrong it's right. Anyway, yesterday, in an e-mail conversation with The Antipodean, I was making a joke about song titles that contained the word love, when I realised how many of them were catachretic. For example, there's Leonard Cohen's Dance Me to the End of Love. That's a perfect catchresis. You would expect the sentence to end with a noun of space or time - Dance Me to the End of the Night or Dance Me to the End of the Street - and instead you get love, which isn't a place, unless you believe the Doors line \"She lives on Love Street\", which is another love-catachresis. Robert Palmer has a catachretic amour: Doctor, Doctor, give me the news. I've got a bad case of loving you; but I don't think Addicted To Love is a catachresis, that's just a metaphor. Love Minus Zero by Dylan is a definitely a catachresis. Dr Love by Bobby Sheen probably counts. Love Me Tender is a catachresis, because it should be Love Me Tenderly. And I'm pretty sure Crazy In Love is a catachresis. But...Well, you can probably see that catachresis is a question of judgement. Rhetoricians will argue forever about how it exactly it differs from enallage (the substitution of one part of speech for another, so Love Me Tender counts). But if you can think of another catachretic love, please put it in the comments. P.S.  Before someone points it out, I know Bad Case of Loving You is by Moon Martin."},

{"title": "Thou and You", "date": "Wednesday 17 April 2013", "text": "A repost:Here's some lovely poetry courtesy of Andrew Marvell. Notice the words in bold.Had we but world enough, and time,This coyness, Lady, were no crimeWe would sit down and think which wayTo walk and pass our long love's day.Thou by the Indian Ganges' sideShouldst rubies find: I by the tideOf Humber would complain. I wouldLove you ten years before the Flood,And you should, if you please, refuseTill the conversion of the Jews.My vegetable love should growVaster than empires, and more slow;An hundred years should go to praiseThine eyes and on thy forehead gaze;Two hundred to adore each breast,But thirty thousand to the rest;An age at least to every part,And the last age should show your heart.Once upon a time English was nice and simple. There was the second person singular thou and the second person plural you. Then in 1066 everything went wrong. The Normans arrived bringing with them the royal plural. \"We are not amused,\" said Queen Victoria. \"We are Henry the Eighth, we are,\" said Henry the Eighth. This pluralisation of royals was not simply I becoming we, they also had to be addressed as though they were plural. So the top of society started to demand that they were addressed plurally as you.   This spread. You became a simple reverential form. Through the sixteenth century it got more and more complicated. People would call others you in the way that junk mail tends to add an esquire to my name. You was everywhere. Thou was familar or condescending. You used it to your servants.  So what do you call the girl you love? What do you say when you are trying to be familiar with the queen of your heart. Do you wish for worship or intimacy? Can you be intimate with your deity? Does it depend whether, like Marvell, you're in Hull or London?  None of these questions bothered William Tyndale as he sat down in the early sixteenth century to translate the Bible. Not for him the shallow flirtations and flattery of society, nor the intricacies of adoration: he wanted accuracy. Now, Greek (in which the Gospels are written) has a second person singular and a second person plural. So he translated the singular as thou and the plural as you. That is why God is thou: not because He is your friend (He isn't, He thinks you're bad), but because God is singular. Jesus thous (it can be a verb like tutoyer) individuals and yous crowds. And here is an oddity, here is a bit of the screenplay for scene 57 of that delicate, lyrical work The Return of the Jedi:Darth Vader, standing with other members of the Imperial council, cautiously approaches his master. The ruler's back is to Vader. After several tense moments, the Emperor's chair rotates around to face him.VADER What is thy bidding, my Master?Thou was the singular, then it was the familiar, then it was the condescending, then it was left only in the Bible often used to address God, and thus thou became reverential again. Well I say that thou has survived only in the Bible. I believe that there are still a couple of people in Yorkshire who thou each other (I'll believe anything about Yorkshire). A popular beat combo from Leeds called (slightly tautologically) the Kaiser Chiefs recorded a song alarmingly titled I Predict A Riot with the lines:Watching the people get lairyIt's not very pretty I tell theeWalking through town is quite scaryIt's not very sensible eitherWhich is thou's proof of life, or at least life Yorkshire."},

In 1902 he adopted the code name, or nom de guerre, of Trotsky, which he seems to have nicked from one of his gaolers.  Stalin was born Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili and was brought up speaking Georgian. After training as a priest he got into communism and adopted the code name, or nom de guerre, of Stalin, which means Man of Steel. Margaret Thatcher was born Margaret Hilda Roberts, and was brought up speaking English, or as close as they get to that in Lincolnshire. She married Denis Thatcher and adopted the married name, or nom de guerre domestique, of Margaret Thatcher. On January 24th 1976, a Soviet military propaganda outlet called Krasnaya Zvezda reported on the new leader of the British Conservative Party under the headline Zheleznaya Dama Ugrozhayet, which means Iron Lady Wields Threats. Zheleznaya means Iron and Dama means Lady. The article claimed (utterly falsely, so far as anybody can tell) that this was how she was referred to in Britain. The article would have died a death, but it was seen by Robert Evans, who was the Reuters Bureau Chief in Moscow. So Evans wrote an article saying that: \"British Tory leader Margaret Thatcher was today dubbed ‘the Iron Lady’ by the Soviet Defense Ministry newspaper Red Star.\" The name caught on in the West, but it was invented in Russia.What's interesting is that, though the Russian story was hogwash, it would have made perfect sense to a Russian. The Soviet Union had, after all, been ruled for thirty years by The Steel Man, and this, I suspect, was what prompted the (baseless) story. If I'm correct in this reasoning (and it all looks pretty reasonable to me), then the Iron Lady was, essentially, named after Stalin.Margaret Thatcher was delighted.

It should be noted that there are several theories for this, and a new one is invented every week, but the standard line* is that it refers to the political career of Arthur Balfour. Balfour was Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1902 to 1905, which, given the size of the British Empire, made him pretty much the most powerful man in the world. However, it was not always thus. When he was first elected to parliament in 1874 he was considered a bit of a joke; and when he was suddenly made Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1887, everybody thought that it was rampant nepotism because the prime minister who promoted him was his uncle, Robert Cecil. So, Balfour's easy success was down to the fact that Bob [Cecil] was his uncle. As I said, there are a bunch of other theories, partially because the earliest written reference comes in 1931. However, if you wanted to know what Uncle Bob looked like, you should (probably) see the picture below. *Despite what a citationless Wikipedia article may tell you."},
{"title": "Prefixed Ports", "date": "Friday 5 April 2013", "text": "Sometimes it's pleasant just to look at a Latin verb and all its different prefixes. It is, I imagine, the same sort of pleasure you get from dressing a Barbie doll up in all her different costumes.Take portare, which meant to carry. It came via French into English with all sorts of prefixes. There import, meaning to bring in. Originally the thing brought in was information (the foreign trade sense is only from 1500) and such information was important. Then there is of course export, to carry out, and deport, to carry away, and if you get a bit carried away with yourself, you disport yourself. You might even end up transported, or carried across. There's comportment, which is carrying yourself together. There's reporting, which is carrying information back. But there was also the French re-apporter, or carry back to, which gives us rapport meaning relationship. Similarly, the B got lost in sub-port or carry from below, and now it's just support. And pro-port became purport.There are portfolios for carrying folios, but it's easier to just get someone to carry your folios for you, perhaps a porter. When you wear clothes you carry them on your body, hence the modern French porter, to wear, and hence pret-a-porter, or ready to wear. Just about every prefix is portable. But there is no modern English verb to port. And moreover, it's only very distantly related to the thing that ships sail into. Odd that."},

It's general theme is that life, or the good bits of it, are over the moment you hit the big three-six, and that nobody will ever love you any more. Quite dispiriting, really. Incidentally, Byron was the first person to be described as mad, bad and dangerous to know, and he invented the phrase 'mental masturbation', which I discussed in this old post.On This Day I Complete My Thirty-Sixth Year'Tis time this heart should be unmoved,Since others it hath ceased to move:Yet, though I cannot be beloved,Still let me love!My days are in the yellow leaf;The flowers and fruits of love are gone;The worm, the canker, and the grief,Are mine alone!The fire that on my bosom preysIs lone as some volcanic isle;No torch is kindled at its blaze - A funeral pile!The hope, the fear, the jealous care,The exalted portion of the painAnd power of love, I cannot share,But wear the chain.But 'tis not thus -and 'tis not here - Such thoughts should shake my soul, nor now,Where glory decks the hero's bier,Or binds his brow.The sword, the banner, and the field,Glory and Greece, around me see!The Spartan, borne upon his shield,Was not more free.Awake!

It meant the Midlands. Then in the 80s Middle England and the Middle Englander emerged (there had been occasional 70s references to Middle Britain). The whole idea seems to have been imported from Middle America. Anyway, I went off to google ngrams to see what they made of the concept, and it's really rather striking. In 1993, Middle England suddenly took off. It rocketed. It exploded. It careered upwards until 2002, when it suddenly started falling away. This blog does not do political analysis.

The word first popped into English in the fifteenth century. Before that it was living in France as bougette, a diminutive form of bouge, or leather bag. Bouge came from the Latin bulga, which also meant leather bag. However, the Norman French took that Latin bulga on in a different way. They had boulge. And from that the English, in about 1200 got the word bulge. Bulge also meant leather bag, but soon it started to mean... well... bulge. However, when sailors referred to the bulge of a ship's hull, they called it a bilge. Then, when sailors referred to the nasty rotten water that collected at the bottom of a ship's hull, they called that bilge water, or just bilge.None of which has anything to do with Bulgarians.I should probably mention that, as ever, the Inky Fool has no political opinions and believes in government by whim.

It's like a caterpillar (from Late Latin Catta Pilosa or shaggy cat) becoming a butterfly or a tadpole (toad head etymologically) becoming a toad, except it's much quicker and takes place in a couple of minutes in Islington Town Hall. Anyway, the oath that he was given to swear rather intrigued me. He swore his allegiance to the Queen and her heirs in the first paragraph, and then his loyalty to the United Kingdom in the second. The full thing goes like this:I [Joe Winston Bloggs] swear by Almighty God that, on becoming a British citizen, I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Her Heirs and Successors according to law.I will give my loyalty to the United Kingdom and respect its rights and freedoms. I will uphold its democratic values. I will observe its laws faithfully and fulfil my duties and obligations as a British citizen.Now perhaps I'm reading too much into this, but loyalty seems to be set in antithesis to the allegiance of the first paragraph, and I can't work out why. Allegiance makes sense in so far as you become the liege-man of the Queen and are now her feudal vassal. Liege derives from old German ledig meaning free.Loyalty comes from French leial, which comes from Latin legal and means... well the OED defines it as faithful in allegiance, which rather takes you back to the first paragraph. It just looks so wrong. I would have imagined that you were loyal to the Queen and bore allegiance to the state. It seems that the Queen gets the good stuff and the UK has to make do.This makes me think that there may be some terribly technical legal distinction. So, are any lawyers reading this? Can you enlighten me? In exchange I will tell you that lawyers are not, etymologically, loyal.

You'll admit that that's a pretty good word.But I couldn't find it. I searched and I e-mailed and in the end I managed to get the translation and interpretation department of a major Italian institution onto the question. Every one of them said that they knew of the practice of buying two suit jackets, one to actually wear as you swan from café to café, and one to leave hanging over the chair in your office so it looks like you're at work, but none of them had ever heard of a single word to describe it.So with heavy heart and hanging head, I gave up and toddled down to the pub to drown my sorrows (remembering, of course, to leave my jacket hanging over the chair by my computer, in case the Muse came past). It's a poor substitute, but I came across another Italian word today, which may reveal something about the great and beautifully governed nation.

The English verb go declines as: go, goes, went, gone. Or at least that's what you're taught in school; but it's a goddam lie.The verb go looks terribly irregular. What's that W word doing between the Gs of go and gone? The etymological truth, though, is that went is a completely different verb.Once upon a thousand years ago there was the present tense go and the past tense gaed*. Then there was another, separate, verb: wend. We still use wend in the phrase to wend your way. Just as the past tense of send is sent, so the past participle of wend became went. So in the past tense you went your way.And then something very odd happened. People stopped using gaed as the past tense of go and pretty much stopped using the present tense of wend. This left modern English with go and went, which became so universally used for motion that they appear to be one irregular verb, which effectively, they now are. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must wend.An old game of go is therefore a went.*But mainly in the North. There was another past tense - eode - in Old English, but that too appears to be a separate derivation."},

{"title": "Thunder Theft", "date": "Monday 25 February 2013", "text": "Once upon a time, there was a playwright called John Dennis (well, from 1658 to 1734 to be precise). In 1709 he wrote a play called Appius and Virginia. I can't find out much about that play, but I assume that it was just a reworking of John Webster's one of a century before. Anyway, the important points are first that the play was rubbish, and second that it had a storm scene in it and required thunder, or at least the sound of it.Now, thunder used to be simulated by rolling iron balls around in a big bowl (the same method used to make mustard). Here's a footnote from a 1750s edition of the Dunciad:The old way of making Thunder and Mustard were the same; but since, it is more advantageously performed by trough of wood with stops in them. Whether Mr. Dennis was the inventor of that improvement, I know not;By all accounts he must have been. Because there are three versions of the same story. That footnote continues:but it is certain, that being once at a Tragedy of a new author, he fell into such a great passion at hearing some, and cried, \"'Sdeath! that is my Thunder.\"You see, Dennis invented a brand new method of making thunder for his production of Appius and Virginia. But though the acoustic method was good, the play was a bunch of crap. Appius and Virginia closed very quickly. This hurt. But when Dennis went to the same theatre the next week to watch Macbeth (by most accounts), damn it all if they hadn't kept his brand new method while cancelling his play.But the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations has:Damn them!

{"title": "I Could Eat A Horse", "date": "Wednesday 20 February 2013", "text": "What with the news that almost every snack in Europe is actually my little pony, and the jokes about spaghetti bologneighs, I keep being asked about the origin of the phrase I could eat a horse. Specifically, does it mean:1) I am so hungry that I could eat something as large as a horse, an elephant or a blue whale.Or2) I am so hungry that I would be prepared eat something unusual, like horse, squirrel or cockroach.So I set off to trace the phrase back. It turned out to be popular all the way through the nineteenth century. But once you get far enough, the phrase changes to I could eat a horse behind the saddle. This version pops up in the stage-play of Guy Mannering (1816) where it seems to be proverbial. The earliest reference I could find was in a book called The Life and Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves written by Tobias Smollett in 1760.A chap is lying ill in bed and complaining about the medical treatment he has been receiving. I've highlighted the bits that I think are relevant:\"What do you chiefly complain of?\"—\"The doctor.\"—\"Does your head ache?\"—\"Yea, with impertinence.\" \"Have you a pain in your back?\"—\"Yes, where the blister lies.\"—\"Are you sick at stomach?\"—\"Yes, with hunger.\"—\"Do you feel any shiverings?\"—\"Always at sight of the apothecary.\"—\"Do you perceive any load in your bowels?\"—\"I would the apothecary's conscience was as clear.\"—\"Are you thirsty?\"—\"Not thirsty enough to drink barley-water.\" —\"Be pleased to look into his fauces,\" said the apothecary; \"he has got a rough tongue, and a very foul mouth, I'll assure you.\"—\"I have known that the case with some limbs of the faculty, where they stood more in need of correction than of physic.—Well, my honest friend, since you have already undergone the proper purgations in due form, and say you have no other disease than the doctor, we will set you on your legs again without further question. Here, nurse, open that window, and throw these phials into the street. Now lower the curtain, without shutting the casement, that the man may not be stifled in his own steam. In the next place, take off two-thirds of these coals, and one-third of these blankets.—How dost feel now, my heart?\" \"I should feel heart-whole, if so be as yow would throw the noorse a'ter the bottles, and the 'pothecary a'ter the noorse, and oorder me a pound of chops for my dinner, for I be so hoongry, I could eat a horse behind the saddle.\"Barley water was a standard medicine in the eighteenth century, and I can't find any reference to people drinking it for fun. I assume therefore that it tasted bad (and that it's rather different from the modern stuff).Now, I don't know much about horses, but I'm going to assume that one that is saddled is sweating, and that the bit behind it is the backside. Not even in France do they eat sweaty horse poo. Not even in Verona.So I'm going to say that the phrase I could eat a horse refers not to the size of the horse, but to its unusualness; and that it's roughly the equivalent of the American I could eat the tail end of a skunk.I would be particularly amused if all the horse butchers in Verona were really selling beef."},

Whether you are planning to spend this evening paying five times the normal price for a corner of a crowded restaurant, or whether you are looking forward to a night of solitary sobbing, blame Geoffrey and ornithology.You see, it's around this time of year that birds start to mate. (I've just conducted a brief field trip and didn't see any feathered fornication, but there was a frisky looking pigeon flapping about in a suggestive way.) How does this connect to Chaucer? Because he wrote a poem about birds falling in love. It's called the Parliament of Fowls, and if you like you can read it here.Essentially, Chaucer dreams that he goes to the garden of love and witnesses a bunch of birds choosing their spouses.For this was on Saint Valentines day,When every fowl cometh there to choose his mate,Of every kind that men thinke mayAnd that so huge a noise 'gan they makeThat earth, and air, and tree, and every lakeSo full was that unethe [hardly] was there spaceFor me to stand, so full was all the place.And that is the first ever reference to Valentine's Day being the day on which creatures choose their sweethearts. Slowly the idea was transferred from birds to people, and that's the cause of all the trouble.The Parliament of Fowls opens with some great lines on Love:The life so short, the craft so long to learn,Th'assay so hard, so sharp the conquering,The dreadful joy alway that slit so yerne [slides away]All this mean I by Love, that my feelingAstonyeth [is astonished] with his wonderful workingSo sore, iwis, that when I on him thinkNat wot I well wher [I don't know whether] I float or sink.And then these bookish and lonely lines:For all be that I know not Love in deed,Nor wot how that he quitteth [pays] folk their hire,Yet happeth me full oft in books readOf his miracles and his cruel ire.So unruffle your feathers, get your hackles up and find yourself a bird."},

Also, the idea I was having was utterly wrong.Winning hands down has nothing to do with poker and everything to do with horses; for though horses have no hands, jockeys do. In the final sprint of a close-run race a jockey forces his horse to run faster and faster by raising his hands and whipping his steed. If, though, there is no final sprint, if one horse is so far ahead that he can win at a canter, then the jockey is able to win hands down.Another etymology I once thought that I knew was that of a dead ringer. There was (really) a craze in eighteenth century England for bells in gravestones. The bell would be attached to a rope the other end of which would be in the coffin beneath. This meant that if you had been buried alive accidentally (or even deliberately) you could simply ring for assistance. From this developed the idea that a dead ringer was someone who so resembled a deceased acquaintance that one would believe that rope and bell had been put to use. This etymology is beautiful and bollocks. The term dead ringer emerged in the United States at the end of the nineteenth century. It's to do with horses. It does, I admit, have an etymological connection to bells. Bell ringers in churches like to ring out a series of patterns each one of which is called a \"change\". Therefore you got the phrase \"ring the changes\" and from that you got the false idea that ringing was to do with changing and from that you got the term ringer for something that had been swapped for something else. You go down to the bookies, place a bet on a slow horse, sneak into the stable at night and substitute a fast horse as a ringer. Then you collect your winnings and squander it all on etymological dictionaries. Dead just means accurate, as in dead centre.Yet if those two origins seem disappointing, if you think me a joy-killing sport-spoiler for debunking such lovely myths, then I have a wonderful wonderful treat for you. Do you know what a flying fuck is? Have you ever wondered or considered what this rarely donated thing could be? Although I once nearly convinced my brother that this was to do with swifts mating in mid-air, a flying fuck has nothing to do with birds and everything to do with having sex with somebody whilst riding a horse. This may sound difficult and indeed it probably is, although I suspect that the bouncing motion of a horse may help in some ways. The phrase was first recorded in around 1800 as part of a poem by Thomas Rowlandson called New Feats Of Horsemanship:Well mounted on a mettled steedFamed for his strength as well as speedCorinna and her favorite buckAre pleas’d to have a flying fuck. Luckily for us, Thomas Rowlandson was a cartoonist and so this earliest citation comes complete with an illustration. The illustration is, of course, pornographic so I have decided to place it discreetly after the jump break.

It means bashful or modest, but it's so much fun to say aloud. \"Don't be pudibund, old boy, you've done splendidly.\" There's even an extra word pudibundery which means prudery, so Ezra Pound could observe that:Darwin, truckling to the religiose pudibundery of his race, has almost wholly neglected the actual facts of sex.Happens to us all.The bund bit at the end of pudibund is a suffix forming verbal adjectives (so saith the OED) and is the same thing you get in moribund or about to die.The pudi bit comes from the Latin pudere meaning to be ashamed. So if you're impudent, you are without shame (and incapable of pudibundery).Now, propaganda are things to be propagated, and agenda are things to get done, and Amanda is a girl to love (literally) and Miranda is a girl to marvel at (literally), and by this pattern and this exact etymology your pudenda are those bits of you of which you should be horribly ashamed, in a fit of pudibundery.Got to love her."},

{"title": "You Div", "date": "Wednesday 30 January 2013", "text": "I've been asked to explain the origin of div. That's the British slang term div, meaning idiot. I'm afraid there will be no explanation. Or to be more precise, there'll be many of them.Now the OED lists two divs. One is an evil spirit in Persian mythology, the other is a mathematicians shortening of divergence. But the OED has nothing to say on the cries of \"You div\", and doesn't acknowledge its existence. It does have divvy, of which more later.Chambers Dictionary of Slang does record the word as being in use since the 1970s. But it says that the etymology is unknown, unless it has something to do with Duh, which seems unlikely.This shortfall, though is thoroughly made up for by the Urban Dictionary, which confidently gives three etymologies, which all contradict each other.Div is a scouse word for idiot. It is short for divvy which in turn is a corruption of Deva. The Deva Hospital was a well known mental hospital (since renamed the West Cheshire Hospital) on the outskirts of Chester. Chester was founded by the Romans who named it Deva. Actually originates from prison slang in the UK. A job often given to the lowest inmates was to put cardboard dividers into boxes. Someone given this job was a 'divider' or a 'div'. Now used as an insult to those who display stupidity.Derived from \"individual needs child\", a cruel schoolyard insult. Not at all politically correct. Someone who's \"not quite normal\", an idiot, spaz, etc.I'm not quite sure that I understand the last one. The Deva Hospital did indeed exist at about the right time (it was so named from 1953 till 1970). However, the OED does have divvy, meaning daft. This is first recorded in 1975 as market traders' slang in Boston, Lincolnshire on the other side of the country from Chester.Then there was a writer in The Guardian in 1987 who said \"I first started using the term ‘divvy’ some 20 years ago... When I was growing up in Liverpool in the 1960's it was commonly assumed to be derived from the word ‘individual’\", which would seem to support the Urban Dictionary's third attempt. #So the short and the long of it is that I'm rather stumped. Does anybody remember div before 1975?Short for this?"},

A Korean friend once smilingly told me that she had worked with American Imperialist Bastards during the time of the Agreed Framework and found they were very friendly, very generous people. She hoped they would come back, she said.This seems to be the most extreme case I've ever heard of a term losing all meaning, and I suppose that it could only happen in a state where vocabulary can get you locked up.

{"title": "Five Minutes", "date": "Monday 21 January 2013", "text": "There's no mention of the noun minute anywhere in the Bible.That's not at all surprising really, because they didn't have clocks. Well, they did have some water clocks; but these weren't common. The point is that if you rang on Jesus' doorbell and asked Him if He could spare ten minutes of His time to talk about Jesus, He wouldn't have known what you meant. Well, he might if he were omniscient, but that's beside the point.Now minutes did exist back then. It was the ancient Babylonians who started dividing angles up by sixty.  If you then do a second division by sixty you get down to a second. That's where it comes from, folks, secunda pars minuta, although St Augustine in his Mathematici was still calling them minutae minutarum or minutes of minutes.However, these were abstract mathematical and astronomical terms that nobody would have used in everyday life. They wouldn't have been used, because they were useless, because there were no clocks.You could, of course, divide the day up into rough hours by the position of the sun. So there are hours in the Bible:Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?But it's probably significant that these references to numbered hours don't pop up until the New Testament, which was written in Greek.Incidentally, the Romans had twelve hours from dawn till dusk, whatever the season. (Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.) This meant that at midwinter the hours were shorter during daylight and longer at night. This is not, though, the origin of the phrase the small hours, which are so called just because they have low numbers (one o'clock, two o'clock).Anyway, there are also no minutes anywhere in the Canterbury Tales (C14th). Chaucer did know about hours and minutes. He wrote about them in his Treatise on the Astrolabe:These degres of signes ben everich of hem considered of 60 mynutes, and every mynute of 60 secundes.But outside of treatises on astrolabes you just wouldn't use these measurements. There were clocks (just) but there weren't that many of them and most people would never have seen one. The hour was still the system of reckoning.Shakespeare has minutes. He has 63 of them. That's because there were clocks, usually in churches. As Falstaff says:The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute draws on.But though Shakespeare often mentions minutes, I think he does so in the way that I might mention nanoseconds or hemidemisemiquavers. I've heard of nanoseconds, but I'd have to Google them to find out what they actually are. And it takes me a bit of calculation before I can work out that a hemidemisemiquaver is a sixteenth of a crotchet. They're cool-sounding units of measurement that I might refer to without understanding them properly.Shakespeare almost always mentions minutes in relation to hours:O God! methinks it were a happy life, To be no better than a homely swain; To sit upon a hill, as I do now, To carve out dials quaintly, point by point, Thereby to see the minutes how they run, How many make the hour full complete; How many hours bring about the day; How many days will finish up the year; How many years a mortal man may live. When this is known, then to divide the times: So many hours must I tend my flock; So many hours must I take my rest; So many hours must I contemplate; So many hours must I sport myself; So many days my ewes have been with young; So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean: So many years ere I shall shear the fleece: So minutes, hours, days, months, and years, Pass'd over to the end they were created, Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave. Now a home-carved sundial won't actually give you accurate measurement of minutes. It's just Shakespeare showing off that he knows the clever word. Shakespeare almost always uses minute in this sort of hour-minute comparison, or just to mean a very short period of time (better three hours too soon than a minute too late). Unless you were actually in front of the church, time was still measured in the tolling of the bell. I'm pretty sure that if you asked Shakespeare whether he could spare ten minutes of his time, he would look rather puzzled as he tried to make a mental calculation of what that meant.Shakespeare never mentions ten minues or five minutes. There's only one play where he uses minute to mean anything precise. That's Midsummer Night's Dream, where Puck says that:I'll put a girdle round about the earthIn forty minutes.Which means that Puck can travel at 37,000 mph. Titania also refers to \"the third part of a minute\", but I don't think that this really shows that Shakespeare knew what he was talking about, any more than I know offhand what a nanosecond is. Twenty seconds is fairy stuff. Shakespeare is just Falstaff, hearing the bell and talking nonsense. If you arranged to meet Shakespeare at twenty to four, he wouldn't be there.It's the pocket watch that brought the minute and then the second into every day speech. You want to know when they became widely available? Just click on this lovely little chart I made.All of this has really been a very long and tedious way round of trying to explain what a miracle it is that we use the phrase five minutes in such an carefree don't-even-think-about-it manner. For us to know what that means requires all of us to have an intricate device attached to our wrists. With our forty-minute commutes, twenty-minute lunch breaks and meetings at twenty past three, we understand time in a way that was unavailable to people a few hundred years ago.We imagine the world in a different way. As of 1980, English fiction contains more references to minutes than to hours. Clockmakers have changed the language.I am a sundial and I make a botchOf what is done much better by a watch.N.B. It should be noted that throughout this I've been talking about what was generally known and generally available. There have been all sorts of cunning devices for measuring time. I'm only talking about the ones that were widespread enough to influence common discourse. The definition of minutes has also varied. This is not a history of clock-making or astronomy, it's a history of how clock making and astronomy have influenced language and popular conceptions of time."},

{"title": "Resolutions", "date": "Wednesday 2 January 2013", "text": "It is a source of constant New Year's shame to me that my computer screen has more resolution than I do. Mysteries are more often resolved than I am.If you solve something, you get a solution. That's because of the Latin word solvere, which meant to loosen or dissolve. So, if you have a knotty mathematical problem, you loosen it - or solve it - and thus get the solution. If you put a sugar lump in hot water it dissolves and you are left with a solution containing sugar.Re- usually means to do something again, but it can just be an intensive prefix, a bit like super-. Thus, resolution arrived in the English language as a chemical term meaning:The reduction or separation of an object or substance into constituent parts or elements; decomposition, disintegration, dispersion. Formerly also: †a material result of this, spec. a smoke or vapour (obs.). Now rare. [OED]Now, imagine looking at a distant nebula or galaxy. To the nude eye, the Milky Way looks rather like a milky way running across the night sky. But if you look at it with a telescope this long smudge is broken up into lots of little stars. It is, like a chemical, resolved. The telescope thus gives you a resolution. And better telescopes have higher resolutions. Similarly, your digital camera breaks up, or resolves, a picture into lots of little pixels. The number of pixels representing the resolution.But the New Year's resolution? Well, that seems to come from the idea of resolving a mystery. Once you've broken something down into its parts, resolution has been achieved. Thus you might resolve a mathematical puzzle. This transfers easily to the idea that your doubts and confusions have been resolved. This transfers nicely to the idea that you are no longer baffled and have now made a decision. You are resolute.

{"title": "Two Bitter Ends", "date": "Wednesday 19 December 2012", "text": "I'm afraid this post will be somewhat inconclusive. If you want something definitive then follow this link for yet another review of The Horologicon.Once upon a time there was the word bit. But not in the sense of a small piece of something. This bit meant bucket, and was cognate with bucket and with a water butt. Somebody who was in charge of a bucket of water was therefore a bitter. So this became a term for a fireman. As in this line from 1467.That the bitters be ready with hur horses and bittes to bring water.But then a bit also came to mean a sturdy thing on a dockside that you could tie a rope to. And the end of the rope that was around the bit? Here's a quote from Captain Smith's Seaman's Grammar of 1627 (that's the same Captain Smith that had a thingy with Pocahontas).A Bitter is but the turne of a Cable about the Bits, and veare it out by little and little. And the Bitters end is that part of the Cable doth stay within boord.This remains in every dictionary to this day. Here's one from 1725:BITTER, any Turn of a Cable about the Bitts is called a Bitter; and 'tis used that the Cable' may be let out by little and little. And when a Ship is so stopp'd by a Cable, they say she is brought up to a Bitter. Also that End of the Cable which is used to be wound or belayed about the Bitts,' they call the Bitter End of the Cable.And that's what's in the OED. So the bitter end is simply the end of the rope. Right? Nothing whatever to do with bitter as in acrid and sour-tasting.Well, that's what I wanted to say, but then I found this from a poem by George Wither published in 1622:With hunger parched, and consum'd with heat,I will enforce them to a bitter end;The teeth of beasts I will upon them set,And will the poisonous dust-fed serpent send.Now it's possible that George Wither was just being nautical. But in the poem that's God speaking and so it's much more likely that he was remembering the fifth chapter of the Book of Proverbs:For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil: But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.So now, well, I just don't know any more. All the authorities say that working to the bitter end is just getting to the very end of the rope. But it also seems to have combined with the more usual sense of bitter to make poor bloggers like me not have a proper conclusion.The reason that I was researching this all in the first place, is that I've been reading Bum Fodder, an Absorbing History of Toilet Paper by Richard Smyth. It's a great little book and ideal for reading on the... yep. Anyway, he says that the bitter end was placed in a bit (or bucket) and was used by sailors for wiping. The OED says that the bitter end was sometimes used as a whip, which seems downright unhygienic. Frustratingly, neither provides a quotation.Anyway, back to that review.Everyday life with a dictionary writer."},
{"title": "Feague", "date": "Monday 17 December 2012", "text": "The single most surprising word I came across when writing The Horologicon was feague. It's the rudest word in the book by quite some way, so I put it in the preface. Here for your delectation and disgust is a simple, extended quotation from the fourth page of the book.There is a single eighteenth-century English word for shoving live eels up a horse’s arse. Here is the definition given in Captain Grose’s Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue:FEAGUE. To feague a horse; to put ginger up a horse’s fundament, and formerly, as it is said, a live eel, to make him lively and carry his tail well; it is said, a forfeit is incurred by any horse-dealer’s servant, who shall show a horse without first feaguing him. Feague is used, figuratively, for encouraging or spiriting one up. There are three instructive points to be taken from that definition. First, you should never trust an eighteenth-century horse dealer. Especially if you’re a horse. Or an eel. Second, the English language is ready for anything. If you were to surprise a Frenchman in the act of putting a conger up a mare’s bottom he would probably have to splutter his way through several sentences of explanation, filled with circumlocutory verbocinations. However, ask an English-speaker why they are sodomising a horse with a creature from the deep and they can simply raise a casual eyebrow and ask: ‘Can’t you see I’m feaguing?’ The ability to explain why you’re putting an eel up a horse with such holophrastic precision is the birthright of every English-speaking man and woman, and we must reclaim it. Thirdly, and finally, you will notice that that definition is not from the Oxford English Dictionary. Though the OED is the greatest and heaviest reference work yet devised by man, it does not necessarily touch the sides of the English language. In the case of feaguing, the OED does actually quote Grose, but rather coyly only mentions only the stuff about ginger. And if that is not enough to make you scamper to the bookshop and buy, here is a lovely review from John Lloyd at The Book Bag.And here is another review by virtue of video:"},

The answer is that once upon a long time ago there was a Latin word commodus, which meant suitable or perhaps convenient. Therefore if you find an object (such as loo roll) that is useful and convenient for you, it is a commodity. Likewise, if you devote yourself to another's convenience (in the non-lavatorial sense) you are being accommodating. Likewise if something is beneficial and apt, it is commodious, as in the sacrament of marriage.Likewise, what is sometimes called a convenience could also be called a commode. As King Lear puts it:Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here's three on's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself: unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare, forked animal as thou art. And here's a photo I took the other day:*As I recall this is all quoting Julius of Norwich, but I can't find it at the moment."},

{"title": "Club and Club", "date": "Friday 26 October 2012", "text": "It's a funny little thing that a golf club can either be a nine iron used to hit a ball, or an organisation that you join because you like playing golf. Similarly, somebody could be described as clubbable because they're the sort of social chap who's welcome in any gentleman's club or because they could easily be hit over the head with a club.What is the connection? The medieval meaning of club was big stick used to hit things with, the sort of thing slouching cavemen are usually depicted with. However, if you don't have a club of your own, you can always make one. The simplest way to do this is mentioned in a 1625 passage about people warding off elephants:Many times they fall upon the elephants which come to feed where they be, and so beate them with their clubbed fists, and pieces of wood, that they will runne roaring away from them.You can make a club out of anything, even your hair. Ladies in the eighteenth century would often wear their hair in a club, which is to say that it wrapped together into what we'd call a bun on top of their heads. And metaphorically, you can wrap people together to make them one powerful object, like a club.The sense development here is, to be honest, pretty damned obscure. Maybe the haircut was the bridge or maybe the sense of a group of soldiers formed into one blunt and brutal club. But pretty much everybody agrees that the idea of a club of people is that metaphorically they have come together like the instrument carried by a slouching caveman.So a golf club and a golf club are, etymologically, one and the same.Both are now weapons"},
{"title": "Pneumatico-Logistics", "date": "Wednesday 24 October 2012", "text": "A reader has asked what the relationship is between pneumatics and pneumonia, and it's more fun than I'd thought. Both of them in their common form relate to air. Pneumatics uses air to drive pistons and the like, pneumonia is a disease of the lungs and affects their ability to breathe air. So far so simple.They both come from the Greek word pneumon, which meant either breath or spirit. For that matter spirit means either breath or spirit. It comes from the Latin spiro, or breathe, and still survives in respire and respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia.The fun thing is that when you look up pneumatic in the OED, the first definition is this:Belonging or relating to spirit or spiritual existence; spiritual.Chiefly in the context of New Testament theology.That's from 1624, and pneumatic doesn't get its engineering meaning until thirty years later. One of the citations (from 1899) has:The Gospel of St. John—the pneumatic gospel, as it was called, or gospel of religious genius.Pneumatic seems to have kept its spiritual meaning and, in the nineteenth century, Jeremy Bentham invented the lovely word pneumatico-hedonistics which means: ...the branch of study that deals with spiritual or mental pleasures (as distinguished from those of the body)And it turns out that I am much more devoted to somatico-hedonistics: \"those branches of art and science which, as above, have for their objects those modifications of pleasure, which have the body for their seat.\"But the funnest pneumo-word in the OED is this: Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis n. (also pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanokoniosis)  [compare pneumonoconiosis n.] a word invented (prob. by Everett M. Smith (born 1894), president of the National Puzzlers' League in 1935) in imitation of polysyllabic medical terms, alleged to mean ‘a lung disease caused by the inhalation of very fine sand and ash dust’ but occurring only as an instance of a very long word.The Inky Fool goes for a spin"},

{"title": "The Villain in the Villa", "date": "Monday 15 October 2012", "text": "Once upon a time, there were Romans who had lovely villas in the countryside and the word is still with us today, even if the villas now tend to be rather suburban things. A Roman villa was not suburban it was usually attached to a farm and would therefore be one of a group of buildings. These buildings constituted the villaticum. Somehow, over the centuries a G got in there and the Old French referred to these buildings as un village and we as a village, with the villa bit still intact in there.It's well known that people who live in villages are rustic, rural uneducated, illiterate peasants. That was the original meaning of villain. Because villains have none of the noble thoughts that fill the minds of educated city-dwellers, but are prey to their basest bucolic instincts - the word shifted meaning and started to refer to anybody who was evil, and that is where we get our modern villains from.All this etymology makes Hamlet's words much more sensible:O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!My tables,--meet it is I set it down,That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:Because if I had a nice villa in Denmark I'd probably smile.Finally, when not smiling and following their baser instincts, village villains often like to write rustic poetry with a peculiar rhyme scheme. And that's where we get the villanelle from. A villanelle is a poem of six stanzas. The first five stanzas have three lines and the last has four. The whole thing rhymes ABA ABA ABA ABA ABA ABAA, which would be impossibly hard were it not that the first line of the first stanza is repeated as the third line of the second fourth and sixth stanzas and the third line of the first stanza is repeated as the last line of the third fifth and sixth stanzas. Got that?No?Well here's an example that Dylan Thomas wrote for his dying father, which is so beautiful that you should buy it from Amazon.Do not go gentle into that good night,Old age should burn and rave at close of day;Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Though wise men at their end know dark is right,Because their words had forked no lightning theyDo not go gentle into that good night.Good men, the last wave by, crying how brightTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,Do not go gentle into that good night.Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sightBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,Rage, rage against the dying of the light.And you, my father, there on the sad height,Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.Do not go gentle into that good night.Rage, rage against the dying of the light.And here's Auden, which is also so beautiful that you should buy it from Amazon.Time will say nothing but I told you so,Time only knows the price we have to pay;If I could tell you I would let you know.If we should weep when clowns put on their show,If we should stumble when musicians play,Time will say nothing but I told you so.There are no fortunes to be told, although,Because I love you more than I can say,If I could tell you I would let you know.The winds must come from somewhere when they blow,There must be reasons why the leaves decay;Time will say nothing but I told you so.Perhaps the roses really want to grow,The vision seriously intends to stay;If I could tell you I would let you know.Suppose the lions all get up and go,And all the brooks and soldiers run away;Will Time say nothing but I told you so?If I could tell you I would let you know.Finally, village idiot is only recorded from 1907.Villains!"},

Mind you, I've always had a private theory that the lines:O, that this too too solid flesh would meltThaw and resolve itself into a dew!Might be adieu and not a dew. But all this is beside my etymological point. Adieu is a contraction of the old French parting A dieu vous commmant, which means I commend you to God. It's a kind sentiment, but French people weren't very kind and couldn't be bothered to say the whole thing. Spaniards were similarly lazy and A dios vos acomiendo became simply Adios.But English people are the unkindest and laziest of all. Once upon a time we used to say God be with you. By about 1590 when Shakespeare wrote Love's Labour's Lost we had dropped the th in with, so Costard saysI thanke your worship, God be wy you.By the time he had got round to writing Othello in the first decade of the seventeenth century, it was printed as God b'uy, I ha done - although my Arden Edition expands this to a full God be with you to make up the iambic pentameter.These days we just say Goodbye, or even just bye."},

It's even got a brand new jacket suitable for the tastes of your young and vigorous countries. Just to prove that I'm not making this up, here's an interview with me in the Chicago Tribune, and a mention in the New York Times, and an extract in the Huffington Post. It's published by Berkley Penguin. Penguins being biologically from Antarctica, and etymologically from Wales*. Pen is the Welsh word for head, thus Penzance in Cornwall is the Holy Headland. Gwyn is the Welsh word for white, as in Gwendolyn, which just means white in the same where that Candida does in Latin. So when Welsh sailors first saw the Newfoundland Auk, with a white patch on his head, they decided to call it a whitehead or penguin. The Newfoundland Auk promptly became extinct. The name would have died with it, were it not for the fact that the auk looks very like the unnamed birds that were pottering around at the south end of the planet. That picture on the left is an auk, so you can see the similarity. Thus the Welsh for white head managed to make it to the other side of the world. Berkley, on the other hand, means clearing in a birch forest - leah was the old English for clearing, and beorc was birch. So Berkley Penguin is, etymologically speaking, a great auk standing in a birch forest.I've searched, but can find no illustration for this. Anyway, run to the shops and order your copy now. Or click on this link and buy it from Amazon.com. So stylish*The following is all best theory, but sometimes disputed."},

The answer, it would appear, is that South Africa has maintained a usage that has long since died out in England. Once upon a time there were traffic policemen who directed the traffic. Then, in 1927, this article appeared in the London Evening Standard, describing a strange new invention:We, of course, changed the name to traffic lights. But in South Africa they merely shortened it to robot. So, rolling all your Rs: \"Turn right at the robot, my friend.\""},

But it also therefore means anything that can travel through the air and was being applied to witches and their broomsticks from the mid seventeenth century. A journalist of 1834 describing insects wrote:Forest flies, ephemerals all like ourselves—but happier far in their airy waftage or watery voyaging, than the vain race of man!And that's roughly the style in which all airlines' websites should be written.Anyway, if any readers are in Cape Town for the next few days, here's a link to the events I'll be doing."},

A quick check in the dictionary told me that a qualm could be the cry of a raven. But the qualm of conscience turned out to be one of those weakening words, like naughty.Back in Old English qualm meant violent death, pestilence and plague. In fact, a qualm was anything that was monstrously and bloodily horrific. A qualm-house was a torture chamber, a qualm-stow was a place of execution.Then, in the sixteenth century, it started to mean a period of suffering, like a bout of fever. Then it began to mean a brief illness, and then a faint feeling of discomfort. And it's from that last meaning that we get the modern ever-so-delicate qualm of conscience.This means, that you can have no qualms about committing qualms.Now, I'm off to a qualm-house to feel qualmish.Many qualms and none.This is another repost, until I'm digitally remastered."},
{"title": "Sulking in the Boudoir", "date": "Monday 10 September 2012", "text": "A repost, as I still can't type.A lady's boudoir is where she sulks.Once upon a time there was a French word bouder meaning to sulk or pout and boudoir is simply the sulk-room, like a panic-room but much moodier.Bouder is probably imitative of puffing your cheeks out, because melancholy is so often accompanied by windy suspirations of forced breath. In exasperation you puff out your cheeks, then you blow the air outwards, perhaps biting your lower lip and making an ffff sound. The whole sound could be transcribed as huff, hence being in a huff.The first ever person to be tetchy was Juliet (as in Romeo). Her wet nurse decided to wean Juliet by putting wormwood oil on her breast. Wormwood is one of the bitterest tastes in the world and the poor baby did not like it:For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;My lord and you were then at Mantua:--Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,When it did taste the wormwood on the nippleOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!Incidentally, wormwood has nothing to do with either worms or wood. If you put wormwood into alcohol a chemical called thujone is released which is a rather effective painkiller. The old Germans referred to it as man-courage or wer-mut. Wer was man - as in werewolf or man-wolf - and mut was courage as in modern English mood.The Inky Fool throws a party"},

{"title": "Once On A Blue Moon", "date": "Friday 31 August 2012", "text": "Today is the day when unusual things happen, for today is a blue moon. It is the second full moon in a single calendar month (the last one was on August 2nd), something that only happens every three years or so.In fact, to be accurate, there are several slightly different definitions of a blue moon, with some people saying that it's the fourth full moon in a three month period, and others (including Brewer's) just saying that it's when the moon appears blue because of dust in the atmosphere.Nobody even knows where the phrase comes from exactly, or why you would call the extra moon blue. There are theories, but none very convincing.If a full moon is something that happens once every two or three years - the last was in 2010 and the next will be in 2015 - then it's much rarer than a month of Sundays, which, if you think about it, should rack up every thirty weeks.As for donkey's years, I have already discussed them in this old post.As for Blue Moon the song, that was the fourth version. The original song was called Oh Lord, Make Me a Movie Star and the lyrics (sing 'em) went:Oh Lord,If you're not busy up there,I ask for help with a prayerSo please don't give me the air.They were written for a 1933 film called Hollywood Party, but the scene was cut. In 1934 Rodgers and Hart tried re-working them for a film called Manhattan Melodrama:Act One:You gulp your coffee and run;Into the subway you crowd.Don’t breathe, it isn’t allowed.But that scene was cut too. So they reworked it for the nightclub scene:Oh Lord,What is the matter with me?I'm just permitted to seeThe bad in every man.That scene wasn't cut, and here it is!But the lyrics still weren't romantic enough. So Hart, probably pissed off as hell by this point, knocked out a fourth version that went:A tip of the blogger's bowler to Altanese Cato for bringing the blue moon to my attention.P.S. I've managed, with sinister dexterity, to slice open the index finger of my right hand, which will apparently be unusable for several weeks and is filled with stitches.

{"title": "Brimborions", "date": "Tuesday 28 August 2012", "text": "At first blush (or even second) brimborium sounds rather like a place name from The Lord of the Rings. But in the proper context, its OED meaning makes some sort of satisfactory sense. So, Fanny Burney in 1786 referred to:...brimborions, baubles, knick-knacks, gewgaws.So a brimborion is a shiny, worthless nothing. It comes from the French breborion, which was defined in a 1611 dictionary as:Old dunsicall books; also the foolish charmes, or superstitious prayers, used by old, and simple women, against the tooth-ache etc; any such thredbare, and mustie rags of blind devotion.Duncical books and threadbare rags would mean that I have several breborion cupboards in my bedroom alone."},

It's related to horology, which is the study of clocks, and to a horologicon, which is a book of hours, and - much more importantly - the title of my new book which comes out on November the first.The Horologicon will not, I confess, address all, or even any, of the burning questions of horology. Instead, it is a book of strange and wonderful words that I've found cavorting at the back of the dictionary. However, unlike most books of strange and wonderful words, these are arranged in a useful manner. They are arranged by the hour of the day when you're most likely to need them.So if, for example, you have ever woken up before dawn and lain abed worrying, The Horologicon tells you in chapter one (6am) that you are suffering from what the Old English called uhtceare, or anxiety experienced just before dawn. If you devote your life to the academic study of breakfast, you will find out in chapter three (8am) that you are an aristologist. And if you come home at midnight and wake everybody up by tramping around the house, it will explain that you are merely the victim of a nightingale floor.The really important thing about the book, though, is that it has an absolutely beautiful blue and silver cover, which is as good a reason as any to order it now from Amazon, Blackwells, Foyles, Waterstones or the Book Depository; so that it slaps onto your doormat on November the second.Ah, lovely."},

You almost certainly have wi-fi (unless you're reading this blog from some paleolithic dial-up system). So? Wi-fi?Can you guess?It means nothing at all. Or nearly nothing.Hi-fi - that means something. It's a shortening of high fidelity, meaning that the sound produced is highly faithful to the original sound recorded. Hi-fi has existed since 1934. The Germans tried to standardise the meaning of the term hi-fi back in the sixties, but it didn't really catch on. It was just a general term of approval that then became interchangeable with cassette player because everybody claimed to be highly faithful.Then in 1999 the inventors of the new IEEE 802.11b Direct Sequence went to a marketing firm called Interbrand to come up with a name that was \"a little catchier\". Interbrand decided that hi-fi was famous, tried and trusted and that if you changed the hi to wi (for wireless) you would have a tip-top brand name.But... there's no fidelity involved at all. No sense of this being a more faithful connection to the router. Wireless fidelity would, if it meant anything at all, refer to a spouse who remained faithful even when not attached to electrodes. It's just a leftover term from a previous invention.The new Wi-fi Alliance were rather awkward about this. They did, for a little while, try to refer to wireless fidelity, but it's such an utterly meaningless idea that the term was dropped and hasn't been seen since 2003. So, wi-fi does not mean wireless fidelity, it means hi-fi with one letter changed."},
{"title": "Bull, Bullshit and T.S. Eliot", "date": "Sunday 12 August 2012", "text": "Some words have origins much ruder than you might imagine, others were once clean and pure but now smeared by association. Take, for example, the phrase \"a load of bull\". This is usually believed to be a shortening of bullshit. And bullshit, you might imagine, was merely an expansion of good old shit.But way back at the beginning of the fourteenth century, the writer of Cursor Mundi said that he wanted to tell his story \"withuten bul\", meaning without any nonsense. He was not one of the hypocrites that are \"all ful with wickednes, tresun and bull\".Bull goes back to the Old French boul, and beyond that to the Latin bulla, which meant bubble. So when somebody talks of a \"load of bull\", it is not excrement, but empty and worthless bubbles.Dialect Notes of 1914 mentions bull as \"Bull, talk which is not to the purpose; ‘hot air’\", and bullshit is first recorded by the OED in 1915. Guess who invented it.The first known use of the excremental bull is in a poem describing the publishing industry titled The Triumph of Bullshit, which was written by T.S. Eliot. The poem was written before 1915 (probably 1910), and of course Eliot may not have invented the word, simply used it.So for your delectation and delight, here is Mr Eliot's work in full. I should warn you that it's not really in the style of the Four Quartets. Of course, the ladies referred to are the lady publishers who kept rejecting his poems:The Triumph of BullshitLadies, on whom my attentions have waitedIf you consider my merits are smallEtiolated, alembicated,Orotund, tasteless, fantastical,Monotonous, crotchety, constipated,Impotent galamatias,Affected, possibly imitated,For Christ's sake stick it up your ass.Ladies, who find my intentions ridiculousAwkward insipid and horribly gauche,Pompous, pretentious, ineptly meticulous,Dull as a heart of an unbaked brioche,Floundering versicles, feebly versiculousOften attenuate, frequently crassAttempts at emotions that turn isiculous,For Christ's sake stick it up your ass.Ladies who think me unduly vociferous,Amiable cabotin making a noiseThat people may cry out \"this stuff is too stiff for us\" -Ingenuous child with a box of new toys,Toy lions carnivorous, cannons fumiferousEngines vaporous - all this will pass;Quite innocent - \"he only wants to make shiver us.\"For Christ's sake stick it up your ass.And when thyself with silver foot shalt passAmong the theories scattered on the grassTake up my good intentions with the restAnd then for Christ's sake stick them up your ass.I love the phrase \"ineptly meticulous\". More early Eliot poems here."},
{"title": "Imaginary Holidays", "date": "Friday 10 August 2012", "text": "I've just completed a Grand Tour. I would say that I've just completed a Grand Tour of Europe, but that would be a tautology as the OED insists that a Grand Tour is:A tour of the principal cities and places of interest in Europe, formerly supposed to be an essential part of the education of young men of good birth or fortune. Three attributes to which I can lay only a fragile claim. I visited Verona and saw Juliet's balcony, which is odd because Shakespeare never visited Verona and the idea that that particular balcony is Juliet's is utter hokum cooked up much later. I made the mistake of trying to explain this to the nice lady in the tourist information bureau. She did not take it well.I visited Vienna, subject of the splendid 80s song by Ultravox, which is odd because Midge Ure had never visited Vienna when he wrote the song.I visited the Hofgarten in Munich which is mentioned in Eliot's The Waste Land. Most of that section is derived from a book called My Past by Countess Marie Larisch, whom Eliot had also met in person. It's a funny little autobiography of an aristocrat describing her mad relatives. For example, one of them saw the ghost of the dead King Ludwig and had a strange conversation with him:\"'Ah me!' he sighed. 'Death has not brought me peace. Cissi, she burns in torment. The flames encircle her, the smoke suffocates her. She burns and I am powerless to save her.'  \"'Who burns, dear cousin?' I asked.  \"'I do not know because her face is hidden,' he answered, 'but I know that it is a woman...\"But Eliot had visited Munich, indeed he wrote much of Prufrock there. And My Past contains no references to the Hofgarten at all - making this a proper piece of poetic tourism. I even went on in the sunlight, though summer did not surprise me.In Prague I read Too Loud a Solitude and then chucked the book into the paper recycling bin. If you want to know why that is so neat, you will have to read the book too.In Marseille, a friend told me that he had, through his own researches, discovered the exact spot that the Marquis de Sade had poisoned three teenage prostitutes. I have never read any De Sade, and can't say that I was filled with a desire to do so.But the main poetic point that I learnt on my travels is that there are no native English rhymes for Prague. This is immensely frustrating if you are trying to write a limerick about every city you visit. The best I could come up with was:While messing around in old Prague aCzech chap purloined my lager.So I slew him right thereIn Wenceslas SquareAnd cooked his remains in my Aga.Geneva was easier but less printable, and Brussels was a doddle. Anyone who can do better with Prague should leave their poem in the comments.P.S. I also visited two branches of Shakespeare and Sons (English language bookshops), one in Berlin and the other in Prague. They were both excellent."},

He had been inspired by a series of children's books about a hero called Tom Swift. Tom Swift is an adventuring sort of chap who goes around having adventures, sometimes in darkest, deepest Africa and sometimes on the Moon. There have been over a hundred Tom Swift books published since 1910 and they still seem to be going strong, there was even a Tom Swift board game once. However, the one that interests us is the tenth in the series which was published in 1911: Tom Swift and his Electric Rifle. In this one Tom Swift goes elephant hunting when he discovers that some of his friends have been taken hostage by a tribe of red pygmies. Luckily for the hero (but unluckily for the red pygmies) Tom has with him his brand new invention: a rifle that uses electricity rather than bullets. It can therefore be set to different ranges and different levels of lethality, so he can stun elephants, kill pygmies etc.It was this invention that Jack Cover was attempting to imitate, and he even decided to call it Tom Swift's Electric Rifle, or TSER.

However, it was the words rather than the sentiment that grabbed my attention. Recreated was pronounced exactly as you might expect: ree-create. But it suddenly occurred to me to wonder what that has to do with recreation with a short re.Create come straight from the Latin verb creare, the supine stem of which was creatum, hence the T. Creare meant to make, but if something was made new or refreshed it was re-creatum. Thus recreation is, indeed, a second creation. And you can be recreated by God or a doctor or a good drink.Also, the first lesson was from Malachi, Chapter IV, where it says:For, behold the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. Which is where the phrase root and branch comes from - as in the root and branch reform that politicians so often promise, and that I so badly need.Heavy pruning"},

{"title": "Travesties and Transvestites", "date": "Friday 15 June 2012", "text": "Sir William Davenant (who was quite possibly Shakespeare's illegitimate son, and quite certainly his godson) wrote a play about theatre life in London in the early 1660s. It takes the mickey out of the latest theatrical fads. A playwright asks an actor:Playwright: What think youOf Romances travesti?Actor: Explain yourself.Playwright: The garments of our Fathers you must wearThe wrong side outward, and in time it mayBecome a fashion.Because travesty was originally a style of theatre where people dressed funny. So you might take the Iliad or whatever and perform it wearing silly clothes and with silly verse. The playwright continues:Playwright: You shall present the actions of the HeroesWhich are the chiefest themes of Tragedy)In verse burlesque.Actor: Burlesque and travesti? These are hard words,And may be French, but not Law French.Take heed, sir, what you say; you may be questioned for it.We would do nothing, sir, but what is legal.Anyway, you'd have a travesty of the Iliad or a travesty of King Arthur and then the word moved gently from meaning parody to meaning generally inferior version. But its root, etymologically, is the Latin trans (meaning across or different) and vestire (meaning to dress). Much later, in the 20th century, when psychiatrists were trying to think of a posh latinate way of saying cross-dresser, they took exactly the same roots, and made transvestite. A hat-tip to the Antipodean for pointing this out to me."},
{"title": "Folk Numbers", "date": "Wednesday 13 June 2012", "text": "This is just a little observation on how to write folk poetry. Louis Armstrong once observed that \"All music is folk music, I ain't never heard no horse sing a song.\"* However, there is a certain style, a certain flavour that some poems and songs have, and that others do not. If we ignore, for the moment, the music; it is rather odd that some lines should be folky and others non-folky. Why?Sing a song of pennies,A pocket full of rye,Lots and lots of blackbirds baked in a pie.Lots of blind mice,Lots of blind mice,See how they run...Yes, sir, yes, sir, several bags fullI wandered lonely as a cloudThat floats on high o'er seven hillsWhen all at once I saw a crowdOf four and twenty daffodils.Let us go through seven half-deserted streetsThe muttering retreats...Do you see what I'm getting at? Precise numbers sound folky. Of course, that isn't an iron rule, but it is a standard ingredient in that folksy flavour. Indeed, the best imitators of folk use this all the time. Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner is a classic example. It's almost an exercise in enumeration. He starts it off in the second line:It is an ancient marinerAnd he stoppeth one of threeWhy three? There's no particular point to the number. And Coleridge does not stop there. There aren't just lots of people on the ship, there are:Four times fifty living menWho are condemned when a pale lady \"whistles thrice.\" Things don't happen in weeks, they happen in:Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,And yet I could not die.Like one that hath been seven days drowned My body lay afloat;The albatross accompanies the ship for precisely nine days, and the spirit follows the boat not \"deep in the sea\", as most poets would have put it, but exactly \"nine fathoms deep\".The same trick is used by the great faker of folk songs, Bob Dylan. Here there are too many examples to name - seven sad forests, six wild horses, fifteen jugglers, five believers, fourth time around - once you start listening for them they're bloody everywhere.So if you want to write something that sounds traditional and folky and magical - just chuck in some precise numbers. Simple.Why this should be is a slightly odder question. And I have three different possible answers.1) It reminds us of the Bible - the forty days and forty nights, the twelve disciples, the ten plagues, the four horsemen, the seven tongued angel etc etc etc. It could also, perhaps, remind us of magical spells in fairy stories where things often have to be repeated a particular number of times.2) (And this is related) Numbers feel significant. When you read in the Ancient Mariner that the spirit was nine fathoms deep, you wonder what that means. It's as though there had been an ancient significance which is now lost in the fogs of time.3) It's how folk actually talk. Poets and novelists will usually say that somebody stayed somewhere a long time. Actual people will say that they lived in Paris (or wherever) for three years. Nobody says \"I work high in an office block.\" They say \"I work on the eighteenth floor.\" Creation is vague. Life requires counting.*Louis Armstrong lived before YouTube"},

It seems to have come from the old verb to bunt meaning to sift, because that was what was done to the material when bunting was made (or possibly what was done with it afterwards). That in turn may come from the Latin bonitare, which meant to make good.So bunting, etymologically, makes things good.There is also an old naval phrase - bunting-tosser - for a ship's signalman who put out the flags.And as an odd bit of historical trivia, that's the first American flag in the upper right of this post.

It should be noted that I'm not quite sure how to spell this. Astro Turf is, officially, two words and a registered trade mark. The conversation went something like:\"Oh, he's only astroturfing.\"\"I know he's only astroturfing. Obviously it's Astro Turf.\"\"But the papers can see that he's astroturfing too. They won't buy it.\"Often you hear a new word, but it kind of doesn't work because people sound that little bit smug while they're saying it and then explain it afterwards to make themselves sound clever. Not here. This was clearly a standard part of their vocabulary that they used as freely as I would use the word drinking. So I asked what it meant.They all looked at me as though I were some kind of hick, which of course I am, and one of them, descending briefly from the higher realm of politics explained quickly that Astro Turf is meant to look like grass but is in fact manufactured, and that astroturfing is therefore when a politician carefully organises and controls a campaign, but tries to make it look as though it's all coming up from the grass roots.Incidentally, the root of radical is radix which is the Latin word for root (you may need to read that twice). Thus a radish is a root, to eradicate is to pull up by the roots, and grass roots politics is etymologically just the same as radical politics.I'd vote for that."},

Which poses the question: what the devil is bash and how did you get so full of it?To answer that question one can turn to the Old Curiosity Shop where Dickens mentions that Dick Swiveller \"spends all his money on his friends and is Bah!'d for his pains.\"By this Dickens means that Swiveller's friends say Bah to him, Bah being an exclamation of contempt. Dickens looks terribly original, but in fact bah has (probably - this is all merely the best theory) been verbed before, by the French and Normans a thousand years ago.First, you should note that bah comes straight from the French. But the Normans had a verb ebahir, which meant to be astonished, or more literally to be reduced to saying 'bah' in amazement. This got altered to abaïr, and that got altered to abaissir and that got altered to abash. These days it's easy to be abashed in the passive; but once upon a time it was just as common to go around abashing people until they were abashed, or just bashed, at which point they became bashful.Thus, by a preposterously serpentine route, Dick Swiveller is abashed.None of which has anything to do with a bash on the head, which appears to come from the Old Norse who had a deplorable habit of doing a lot of such bashing.Ouch."},

But he then tells Moses to do the same thing every seven years:Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the Lord: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard. That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land.This sounds rather lovely, and is, of course, the origin of the sabbatical. But what happens every seven seven years? Well at that point God just declares a holiday multiplied by a holiday.And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years. Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land. And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed. For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.And what (I hear you shriek) is the trumpet of the jubile. Well, a jubile is a Hebrew yōbēl or ram, and so the trumpet of the jubile is a ram's horn trumpet that gets blown every fifty years.Of course, this year the Queen is Diamond Jubilarian. So maybe we shouldn't use a ram, and instead make a trumpet out of a pigeon.I must also remember to free my slaves.Tootle tootle."},

This is a sport in which a chap throws a ball at a stool and another chap attempts to bat it away. Stool-ball is the subject of a lovely little C17th poem by Robert Herrick:At stool-ball, Lucia, let us play  For sugar-cakes and wine : Or for a tansy let us pay,  The loss, or thine, or mine.  If thou, my dear, a winner be  At trundling of the ball, The wager thou shalt have, and me,  And my misfortunes all.  But if, my sweetest, I shall get,  Then I desire but this : That likewise I may pay the bet  And for all a kiss. Where a tansy is a kind of cake. I don't know if any arrangement like Herrick's had been made between Andrew Strauss and Darren Sammy, but I did notice that the game seems now to be commonly referred to as cricket, and that nobody seems to be utterly sure why. The OED has a veritable essay on the subject, but the best theory seems to be that a cricket is a stool. You see, there's a kind of little foot-stool called a cricket-stool which is recorded from 1559 (Item 2 old chaires‥. Item one litill crekett stole.), and therefore if stool-ball were played with a cricket stool it would become cricket. And so, in 1575 you have the first record of the noble game:Ther are made likewyse, many-kynde of Balles, Tut-staues or Kricket-staues, Rackets, and Dyce, for that the foolish People, shoulde waste or spende their tyme ther-with, in Foolishnes.This is utterly true, but I like foolishness.

It's from a 1935 article in Vanity Fair:Schmaltz (cf. the German schmalz, meaning grease) is a derogatory term used to describe straight jazz.So far, so not that interesting really. Schmaltzy = greasy. But today, only today I learnt that it's the smell and associations of the grease that are important. Melted chicken grease would be an integral part of the big family dinners that New York Jews associated with home, and mama and papa, and sentimentality and all of the other terrors of kinship.

The Hesychast monks of the Middle Ages would sit on Mount Athos contemplating their belly buttons in order to achieve spiritual enlightenment. Here are Abbot Symeon's instructions on the matter of meditation:Sitting alone in private, note and do what I say. Close the doors and raise thy spirit from vain and temporal things. Then rest thy beard on the breast and direct the gaze with all thy soul on the middle of the body at the navel.The Hesychasts therefore became known as the Omphalopsychites, which means, approximately, navel-spiritualists.

Indeed, it's so odd that it doesn't exist in America, so far as I can tell. On those strange shores cottoning on means getting on well with, which is in fact exactly what the phrase meant on these strange shores a hundred and fifty years ago.In John Camden Hotten's A Dictionary of Slang, Cant and Vulgar Words Used at the Present Day in the Streets of London (1860), you'll find this entry; and it's pretty easy to see how you can go from liking something to understanding it.COTTON, to like, adhere to, or agree with any person; \"to COTTON on to a man,\" to attach yourself to him, or fancy him, literally, to stick to him as cotton would. Vide Bartlett, who claims it as an Amercanism; and Halliwell, who terms it an Archaism; also Bacchus and Venus 1737.Well, Halliwell was right. The phrase is, to all intents and porpoises, pre-American and has been around since the mid sixteenth century. So far as anybody can tell it comes from the practise of lining clothes with cotton. So something that is made of a coarse, thick, warm material on the outside can have a cotton interior to make it comfortable. A dictionary of 1706 has this:In making Hats, To Cotton well, is when the Wool and other Materials work well and imbody together.Obviously, the inner and outer layer have to fit perfectly together and thus cotton well, and thus two people who fit together perfectly are said to have cottoned.Or there's the possibility that it comes from the Welsh cytuno, meaning agree. I'd try to combine the two explanations, but they just won't cotton.Hi, mum."},

{"title": "Make No Bones", "date": "Wednesday 25 April 2012", "text": "To make no bones about something is a rather odd phrase when you think about it, especially as even modern medical science is unable (to my limited modern medical knowledge) to make bones at all.The origin of the phrase lies hidden in food and drink and soup (the latter a curious platypus between the two). There's an early sixteenth century poem about a pub in Leatherhead and the quality of the beer there. It had a rather unhygienic landlady:And sometimes she blensThe dung of her hensAnd the ale together...I've drunk at a pub in Leatherhead, and this makes me wary. However, the landlady is sure that it only affects the new ale. So when, later in a the poem, a girl called Ales (Alice) enters the bar,And as she was drinkingShe fell in a winking [doze]With a barley-hood [booze-induced stupor]She pissed where she stoodThen began she to weepAnd forthwith fell on sleepElynour [the landlady] took her upAnd blessed her with a cupOf new ale in cornsAles found there in no thornsBut supped it at onesShe found therein no bones.Because it is only bones that make you choke and spit something back up. A few years later a paraphrase of the New Testament has this phrase about Abraham*:He made no manier bones ne stickyng, but went in hande to offer up his only son Isaac.And so on and so forth. Until the seventeenth century a lot of the citations keep something of the food metaphor, but it slowly got lost and the bones that were obvious obstacles to digestion simply became mysterious obstacles that were somehow made.And pubs in Leatherhead? I couldn't tell you whether they've changed. I was in a barley-hood at the time.The Inky Fool's horse was looking rather thin.*Yes, I know, but I can't find a copy of the original to explain."},

This mixing of languages is called macaronic, because the languages are beaten together in the same way that flour and other ingredients are beaten together to make the great Italian dish macaroni.So great was the Italian dish of macaroni, that rich C18th travellers would come back to England raving about how delicious macaroni was. They even founded a club called the Macaroni Club at which they could meet, eat macaroni, and discuss how rich and stylish and well-travelled and too-good-for-England they were.Or maybe they didn't. Though Horatio Walpole did mention in a letter of 1764:The Maccaroni Club (which is composed of all the travelled young men who wear long curls and spying-glasses).It's quite possible that he was making the club up, in the way I could dismissively say that people were all members of The Coke and Cocktails Club as a sort of joke.Anyway, the term caught on and soon any young fop who tried to affect foreign fashions was called a macaroni, which is why when the foolish Yankee Doodle puts a feather in his cap, he called it macaroni.And finally, there's the question of what you call a foppish penguin. You see, there's a species of penguin that looks as though it spends all its time dying and styling its hair into the most ridiculous fashions, just like a macaronic fop. The species is therefore called the Macaroni Penguin. So stylish."},

So saith the OED anyhow. You see, the Spanish for cicada is cigarra and cicadas are said to have bodies that resemble a cigar in shape.Not being terribly familiar with cicadas (they rarely trouble the sodden residents of Clerkenwell), I had to look them up on Google and... well... have a look at that picture on the right. I can't imagine smoking such a thing by mistake.But then, then I saw a picture of a cicada cocoon. And suddenly it all made sense. Rather strangely (to my tongue at least), cicadas are often cooked in their cocoons and eaten. Here is a picture:It's those ones in the middle. Time for lunch, I think.And, of course, just as a kitchenette is a little kitchen and a maisonette is a little maison, a cigarette is just a little cigar with the stress moved to the first syllable."},
{"title": "Gone Gay", "date": "Monday 16 April 2012", "text": "I was watching Bringing Up Baby on Friday night. It's a classic Cary Grant film from 1939, and it reminded me of the word gay.Nobody is quite sure when gay shifted meaning from jolly to homosexual. It's complicated by the fact that gay could also mean libidinous, as evidenced by a 1939 citation from the OED:She understood that there had been ‘ladies’. Her father had in fact a‥reputation as ‘gay’.Which looks a trifle strange to modern eyes. Also, the whole reason that the word gay came to mean homosexual was that it could mean jolly. Here is an explanation of its origins from 1941 by a man named Painter:Supposing one met a stranger on a train from Boston to New York and wanted to find out whether he was ‘wise’ or even homosexual. One might ask: ‘Are there any gay spots in Boston?’ And by a slight accent put on the word ‘gay’ the stranger, if wise, would understand that homosexual resorts were meant.And 1941 is the first year that there are unambiguous records of the word in its Uranian sense. However, there are lots of previous citations where gay could just possibly maybe refer to manly love and one of the ones cited in the OED is the film Bringing Up Baby. There's a point where Cary Grant has his clothes stolen whilst he's in the shower and is therefore forced to wander around in a lady's negligée. It's utterly uncertain what the word means here, especially as \"go gay\" could mean \"lose your mind\", so judge for yourself.Whilst this is playing, try pressing 9 on your keyboard again and again and again and again."},

A thunder-plump tends to be preceded by thunder-drops which are the large, scattered raindrops that tell you that the weather is about to kick off something rotten.Neither of these should be confused with a thunder-mug, which is an old term for a chamber pot.Anyway, I dived for protection into a second-hand bookshop and came out with an Arden edition of The Two Gentlemen of Verona.

Nothing at all should be attempted today, least of all writing blog posts. The reason for this misadventurousness is unclear. It may be that it remembers Easter Monday of 1360 when the English were happily invading France and:...the morwe after Ester Day, Kyng Edward with his Oost lay byfore the Citee off Parys; the which was a ffoule Derke day of myste, and off haylle, and so bytter colde that syttyng on horse bak men dyed; Wherefore, vnto this day yt ys called blak Monday.That is a reasonable description of today's weather in London. However, that story is not recorded until 75 years after the event. Black Monday is even less likely to commemorate the day in 1260 that English settlers were massacred in Dublin, as that idea isn't recorded until 400 years after the event. Or it could be the day on which everybody has a hangover from celebrating the resurrection of Our Lord a trifle too enthusiastically. This is a different Black Monday that occurred in July"},

{"title": "Flourishing Paraphs", "date": "Wednesday 4 April 2012", "text": "Para was Greek for beside. So lines that are parallel were para allelois or beside each other and those who are paranoid were para nous or, literally, beside their minds. Therefore, if you made a little mark in the margin of a Greek text to indicate a break or a new section this was written beside the text and was a para-graph.Paragraph can, and has, been shortened and corrupted in all sorts of ways. John Florio's 1598 Worlde of Wordes has:Paragrafo, a paragraffe, a paraffe, a pilcrow, whatsoever is contained in one sentence.Pilcrow is still the standard term for the paragraph mark ¶ that you can sometimes see. But paraph has retained much more of the original meaning. You see a paraph is the technical name for the long flourishing extravagant line with which so many people end their signatures. Take, for example, Benjamin Franklin's signature: Now that is a paraph and a half.Speaking of a paraph-and-a-halfs, an academic fellow once told me that the best way to spot the weak point in a long essay is to flick through and find the longest paragraph, because that will always be where the writer was most confused. It's a rather good trick, and saves actually reading things."},
{"title": "Birthday Suits", "date": "Monday 2 April 2012", "text": "A birthday suit was, originally, a suit of clothes worn on the king's birthday. The term first pops up in Swift's Modest Proposal (1729), where the approach of the Day of Judgement encourages some rich ladies to cancel their orders at the dress-makers:Three of the maids of honour sent to countermand their birth-day clothes; two of them burnt all their collections of novels and romances, and sent to a bookseller's in Pall Mall to buy each of them a Bible, and Taylor's \"Holy Living and Dying.\" But I must do all of them the justice to acknowledge, that they showed a very decent behaviour in the drawing-room, and restrained themselves from those innocent freedoms, and little levities, so commonly incident to our ladies of their profession. So many birth-day suits were countermanded the next day, that most of the tailors and mantua-makers discharged all their journeymen and women.A mantua, by the way, is a kind of loose gown. Anyway, the phrase birthday suit has such an obvious suggestion of being as naked as the day that you were born, that Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1811) has this entry:Balum Rancum. A hop or dance where the women are all prostitutes. N.B. The company dance in their birthday suits. I am now off to dance a balum rancum. And anyone who works out what the pictures are is terribly clever."},

{"title": "Apricate", "date": "Wednesday 28 March 2012", "text": "The Londoners among you, will need only one word on a day like this: apricate, which means to bask in the sun. Londoners rarely get a chance to do this, and even when we do, we are liable to be disturbed by cranks and madmen of the city. This is not a new trend. Aubrey's Brief Lives has this story about Sir Thomas More (1478-1535):Sir John Danvers's house at Chelsea stands in the very place where was that of the Lord Chancellor Sir Thomas More, who had but one marble chimney-piece, and that plain.Where the gate then stood there was in Sir Thomas More's time a gatehouse, according to the old fashion. From the top of this gatehouse, according to the old fashion. From the top of the gatehouse was a most pleasant and delightful prospect as is to be seen. His Lordship was wont to recreate himself in this place to apricate and contemplate, and his little dog with him. It so happened, that a Tom o'Bedlam [madman] got up the stairs when his Lordship was there, and came to him and cried, \"Leap Tom, leap!\" offering his Lordship violence to have thrown him over the battlements. His Lordship was a little old man, and, in his gown, not able to make resistance; but having the presentness of wit, said, \"Let us first throw this little dog over.\" The Tom o'Bedlam threw the dog down: \"Pretty sport!\" said the Lord Chancellor: \"go down and bring him up again, and try again.\" Whilst the madman went down fro the dog, his Lordship made fast the door of the stairs, and called for help: otherwise he had lost his life.Be cautious in your aprications. Nothing changes. Only the dogs are different.Incidentally, apricate has nothing to do with apricots, which are so called because the ripen early in the summer. The Latin for early is praecox. Add an A and your get A-praecox. This means that they are more closely related to an affliction of hasty gentlemen than to the heat and calor of the day.Not so fast."},
{"title": "Jogging", "date": "Monday 26 March 2012", "text": "If the sight of a jogger jogging in the park jogs your memory, that is thorougly appropriate. To jog originally meant to jerk. So if your memory receives a jolt, it is jogged, as in the tract of 1778: An Antidote to Popery; or, the Protestant's Memory jogg'd in Season.However, if what happens if you jerk and jolt yourself repeatedly? Well, obviously you could just add the frequentative suffix -le and get joggle. But you might find yourself moving along in little jolts, or as Dr Johnson put it in his dictionary:Jog: to move with small shocks like those of a low trot.So a joggling jogger who jogs your memory, is all one verb jogging around the language. However, it has no relation to juggling - which is actually a cognate of jocular. Etymologically unnecessary."},
{"title": "The Polyphloisboisterous Wiliad", "date": "Friday 23 March 2012", "text": "The following is from the London Review of Books. It's a rather recondite discussion of the historical existence of Troy and its relationship with a city called Wilusa, but it gives me such puerile pleasure that I thought I should reproduce it here so that you, dear reader, can snigger.Wilusa is most definitely Troy. The book we know as Iliad is the adjective for the city of Ilios - in our present text of the Iliad the place is called Troié less often (53 times) than it is Ilios (106 times). Ilios sounds much closer to Wilusa than Troié but their identity need not rely on a similarity that could be coincidental, because it can be shown quite conclusively that the city's original name was 'Wilios': the W sound in both spoken and written East Ionic Greek, was used till 1200 BCE and became increasingly silent thereafter: the Iliad was really the 'Wiliad'.Full article here.While we're on the subject of the Wiliad, there's a word that Homer often uses to describe the sea. πολυϕλοίσβοιο or polyphloisboio, which means loud-roaring. So familiar was this word to the classically educated chaps of the C19th, that is got imported as-is and has endured a long, if rather obscure, run in the English language. First was polyphloisboioism in 1823, then polyphloisboian, then Thackeray really upped the game in 1843 with the sentence:The line of the shore washed by the poluphlosboiotic, nay, the poluphlosboiotatotic sea.And then in the 1890s it was portmanteaued with English to make polyphloisboisterous, which is great fun to say aloud. The Inky Fool smoked his pipe obscurely."},
{"title": "Manufactured Manure", "date": "Wednesday 21 March 2012", "text": "It's always rather pleasant to watch a word shift in meanings until it means the opposite of itself. Such a word is manufactured, which is Latin for handmade. Manus is hand, as in manual, and facture is making as in, well, a factory, where things are made. But the difference between a factory and a manufactory is the handiwork.Thus an Elizabethan chap could write:Yet the image is rather a manufacture, to wit, a thing wrought vpon a creature by the artificer's hand...And yet now, we would consider handmade and manufactured to be antonyms.Another lost hand of etymology is manure. Once upon a time manuring was simply working by hand. People would manure their farms and gardens until their hands were sore. But obviously, a central part of this horticultural handiwork, was spreading dung upon the land. Mind you, a 1561 translation of Calvin could still have the line:The worde of God‥if it light upon a soul manured with the hand of the heavenly spirit, it will bee most fruitfull.Which is something to consider next time you're getting a manicure."},

Nob used to mean head in C18th thieves slang and dicked... well dicked is a bit obscure, but the first recorded use of it to mean penis wasn't until a slang dictionary of 1891.What we might now call a dick was, back in the C18th, sometimes referred to as a man's gaying instrument, where gaying meant happy-making.I think I should stop there, only noting that, according to William Holloway's General Dictionary of Provincialisms, in early Victorian Yorkshire an ass-hole was an ash-hole."},

The only one that ever sticks in my mind is Terpsichore, the muse of dance. This is largely because whenever I invite a hapless wallflower to skip the heavy fandango with me, whether at rave or discotheque, I usually phrase it \"Would you like to pay homage to Terpsichore?\"*I thought that I was alone in such recondite invitations, until I found this 1960 film in which a very young Oliver Reed propositions a girl by saying:Say, baby, you feel terpsichorical?

{"title": "Etiquette on Tick", "date": "Wednesday 14 March 2012", "text": "Once upon a long time ago in France, there was the word étiquette. But it didn't have the meaning that it has today. Etiquette was nothing to do with passing the port the right way through a revolving door. An étiquette was just a small piece of paper.So far as anybody can tell (and nobody is sure of this) people would write down the rules of the court on a small piece of paper and hand them out to visitors, or pocket them so they didn't forget who was meant to give way to whom. Thus our English etiquette.However, the primary French sense also got straight into our language by the much simpler route of dropping the E at the beginning. Etiquette became ticket: train tickets, political tickets, lottery tickets. Even the small piece of paper behind the bar on which your drinks bill is tallied is a ticket. That's why, when you buy something on credit, you buy it on tick.Court etiquette used to be a terribly complex and time consuming thing. For example, when you got up to leave from supper everybody had to leave in reverse order of seniority, with the king going last. That meant that you had to size up everybody else at the table and shuffle around and wonder whether it was your turn (unless you slyly consulted your étiquette) and it all got very awkward and slow. That's why when Lady Macbeth tells her dinner guests to leave immediately, she says:At once, good night:Stand not upon the order of your going,But go at once.The order there isn't her command, it's about not standing on ceremony and just Getting Out Now."},
{"title": "Trumps and Triumphs", "date": "Monday 12 March 2012", "text": "It may seem odd that charges in the newspapers are almost invariably trumped up. The cause can be found in a bit of etymology which leads, like all good roads, back to Shakespeare. In Antony and Cleopatra, when Antony realises that all is lost, he complains that Cleopatra has:Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my gloryUnto an enemy's triumph.The card-playing metaphor continues to the very last word of that quotation, because a triumph, or terrestrial triumph as it was more usually called, was an old term for a winning card.It didn't take long for a triumph card to get slurred and shortened to trump card. Then trump got verbed and you became able to trump your opponent.Trumps are annoying things when your opponent has them, and so phrases emerged like trumping upon someone, which meant to throw out an obstacle as one card player will do to another. So trump became a synonym for any unexpected obstacle, and trumping became a term for producing such an obstacle out of the blue.So if you arrest somebody out of the blue just to stop them doing something, then you trump up charges, like a card player spoiling your winning ace.

I'm not sure whether this is a useful word for you, dear reader, but I thought I'd tell you in case the word ever popped up in the jobs section of the classified ads.I imagine that your main duties would be getting the orgial started, as an orgial is a song sung at orgies. That and looking after the clothes.Anyway, it's etymologically appropriate as orgy is probably related to the Greek ergon meaning to work. If this is so, then orgy would be connected to ergonomics (the study of people at work), and I suppose that would be another concern of the orgiophant. The Inky Fool knew this would be a tricky one."},
{"title": "Pulp Shakespeare", "date": "Wednesday 7 March 2012", "text": "Usually, parodies of Shakespeare are rubbish. People think that if you throw in a few thous, prithees and marry nuncles that that's enough. It's not. Because if you've ever read much Elizabethan drama you'll know that that is how they all spoke. Moreover, they usually fail to make any use at all of blank verse, which means that the Shakespeare parody is nothing more than godwottery, gadzookery and a blizzard of well-known archaisms.That's why the video below is fantastic. Not only have the writers put it mostly into iambics, not only do they have occasional references to actual Shakespeare lines (making the beast with two backs with the moor), but they have zeroed in, as all good parodies do, on Shakespeare's weaknesses. Will's love of puns and word play is often quite preposterous. Before watching this you should know that tread, for example, was an Elizabethan term for sex and for foot, thus setting up a ridiculously overinvolved set of puns on the subject of foot massages. And the silliness of \"dropping the rock of horror as though he were a mere stone\" and \"The rock's words stick and stutter as stones themselves/And roll smooth no more\" is just what Shakespeare would have done.Were I in LA I would be buying tickets now.Eagle eyed readers will have worked out by now, that this is a Shakespearean reworking of the film Pulp Fiction, familiarity with which is probably necessary for full enjoyment."},
{"title": "Opportunity Blows", "date": "Monday 5 March 2012", "text": "The temple of PortunusIf you're a sailor in a sailboat then you care a lot about winds, and the best sort of winds are those that blow your ship towards the port that's your destination. Or at least, they're the best sort when you're on the open sea.If you're a sailor who happens to speak Latin, then you will describe these winds as ob portunus, or towards the port, because Portunus was the god of harbours. These ob portunus winds are good and favourable and represent, for the homesick seasick sailor, an opportunity.By a reverse of this process, you can really pick the wrong moment to ask somebody for something and thus you are im-portuning them.Etymologically speaking, this has a pleasant side-effect. Port wine is named after Portugal which is named after the Portus Cale. So if you hurl yourself towards an unguarded bottle of port then you have become an opportunist.When leaving port, you should rely more on the tides than the winds. Wait till high tide, or flood, and then let the retreating waters pull your boat out. To see exactly how the metaphor survives have a look at this passage from Shakespeare.There is a tide in the affairs of men,Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;Omitted, all the voyage of their lifeIs bound in shallows and in miseries.On such a full sea are we now afloat;And we must take the current when it serves,Or lose our ventures.

In fact, spring to me is the season in which the restaurants start to put their tables outside on the pavement. Instead of swallows, I have crowds of happy smokers loitering outside the pub on the corner. Instead of melting snows, I have the slow disappearance of hats.I shall therefore, probably, never know the joys of the cuckoo ale, which is described thus in a magazine from 1821:A singular custom prevails in Shropshire which is, we believe peculiar to that county. As soon as the first cuckoo has been heard, all the labouring classes leave work, if in the middle of the day, and the time is devoted to mirth and jollity, over what is called the cuckoo ale. The cuckoos will never, I fear, return to Clerkenwell, although the cuckolds may. As is well known, cuckoos lay their eggs in the nests of other birds, and therefore if someone else has lain in your bed, you have been cuckooed or cuckolded.Also, the bone at the base of your spine is called the coccyx because it resembles, supposedly, a cuckoo's beak.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to devote myself to mirth and jollity.

Such a word is handsome, which apparently is as it does - a phrase I have never understood. When you realise that handsome used to be a synonym for handy, it seems obvious.Something that is hand-some is, or was back in the fifteenth century, suitable for the hands. It was easily handle-able. It was conveniently to hand. It was handy.From convenient it was a short shift in meaning to appropriate. And because a large reward is always felt to be an appropriate one, handsome then started to mean big - a meaning we still use in phrases like \"He was handsomely rewarded.\"And then, from the sense of being a good size, you got the modern meaning of human, usually male, beauty.Mind you, this may not be the case in America. Certainly, in the C19th an Englishman could still observe that on the far side of the Pond:A writer is styled ‘a very handsome author’, meaning a good and clever one, and quite irrespective of his appearance, which may be the reverse of comely.Not handsome, then."},

{"title": "Cock-Squailing", "date": "Monday 20 February 2012", "text": "Those of you who have read The Etymologicon may just remember that in chapter two I recount how the French game of poule, where you threw things at a chicken for a prize, gave us the idea of pooling your money. As I recall, I had a lot of fun at the expense of our Gallic and gallicidal cousins.However, I have now discovered that we had almost exactly the same sport in England. It was called cock-squailing, or sometimes cock-throwing. It was pretty much the same as the French version. You paid a penny, and in return you were given a stick, or cockstele, to throw at the poor chicken. Whoever killed the chicken, got to eat him.Changes in attitude to this practice can be seen from two OED citations. The first from 1663:Cock-throwing. Cock-a-doodle do, 'tis the bravest game.And the second from 1825:Cock-squailing, a barbarous game, consisting in tying a cock to a stake, and throwing a stick at him from a given distance, so as to destroy the bird.There are references to cocksteles going back to the early sixteenth century. However, the fullest description I could find was the following letter to The Sporting Magazine from 1795:Gentlemen,As the custom of squailing at cocks is very prevalent in the part of the country in which I reside, and as it may not be known to the generality of your readers, I take the liberty of transmitting the following description.A few days ago I happened to be a spectator where a rabble of idle fellows were convened for the purpose of barbarously torturing at a stake, those domestic animals. Among the rest, a rustic approached in tattered garb, with a bad on his shoulder, wherein was supposed to be deposited a cock. But though he attended ultimately for the purpose of making the dumb creature the sport of infidels, he feigned to profess himself a friend to humanity, nor would he submit to tie his bird to a stake, as is the custom, but devised the following manoeuvre: That a large earthen pan should be procured, under which the cock was to be lodged, to be paid the gamester's stipulated gratuity for throwing, and whoever was fortunate enough to break the pan, would be entitled to the sheltered victim.These humane proposals being unanimously acceded to; the rustic artfully conveyed the pretended object of his sympathy under the potter's vessel. A ragamuffin undertook to abolish the clay-burnt mark; and after having incurred a pretty heavy expence shivered the pan to atoms, when to the astonishment of the multitude, (though to their no small diversion) instead of a cock, up flew a huge rusty owl, crying Hoo-hoo-hoo! The winner has ever since been known and called by the name of Hoo-hoo-hoo!Yours & CDuckwingIpswichJune 10, 1795Though cock-squailing gets several other mentions, some things make me suspicious of that particular story, not least the name of the correspondent. Anyway, I thought I'd recount my researches, partly because it's a splendid corroboration of the etymology, partly because I was a little unfair to the French, and partly because cock-squailing was always practised on Shrove Tuesday, which is tomorrow. Cocksteles at the ready.The Inky Fool wondered why he had been asked to dress up in such a silly chicken costume."},

{"title": "Nest-Egg", "date": "Thursday 16 February 2012", "text": "I had always assumed that a nest-egg (of the financial variety) was something that would hatch upon a rainy day. I made this mistake because I have never kept chickens.Chickens, being giddy creatures, are liable to lay their eggs and then, when they have hatched, to abandon their nest. To stop this happening the solicitous gallicultist will slyly introduce a nest-egg. A nest egg is not an egg at all, but it looks like one and the chicken is fooled. She stays with the nest constantly hoping that the little fake will hatch. Whilst there, she lays more eggs of her own.The metaphorical potential of a nest-egg that keeps the chicken laying was not lost upon Samuel Butler who in 1678 described a lawyer's office thus:...mounted in his pew,With books and money placed for shew,Like nest-eggs to make clients lay;And for his false opinion pay...And from there it became the principal invested in a bank to produce dividends and interest. So, properly speaking, one should, if one wishes to maintain the metaphor and solvency, spend only the interest on your nest egg.However, in matters financial one should always remember the words of George Best: I spent a lot of money on booze, birds and fast cars. The rest I just squandered.I too like chicken pie."},

{"title": "Aftermath", "date": "Monday 13 February 2012", "text": "Everybody knows the word mow. It's the thing that you can't be bothered to do to grass. If we weren't such inconstant gardeners we might even know the word math, which is defined in the OED thuslywise:A mowing; the action or work of mowing; that which may be or has been mowed; the portion of a crop that has been mowedIt makes me tired just reading the definition. There are even compounds formed of math. There is a day math, which is the amount of land you can mow in a day. There is an undermath, which is an undergrowth of grass. There is even a latter-math which is the later mowing, it's the grass that has grown after the first math. There is even a synonym for latter-math: aftermath.The aftermath of an earthquake, a revolution or a bottle of gin is merely a metaphor derived from mowing. This pleases me.The first metaphorical use of aftermath seems to have been in a rather extraordinary 1656 poem called To my honoured friend Mr T.C. that asked me how I liked his Mistress being an old Widdow.The simple answer is that he didn't, and wrote the most extraordinarily ungentlemanly poem containing couplets like:If thou wilt needs to sea, O must it beIn an old galliasse of sixty three?He's immensely troubled by the widow's lack of virginity and says:Rash lover, speak what pleasure hathThy spring in such an aftermath?Those of you who have read The Etymologicon will know that the Rolling Stones are named after an implement for keeping your lawn nice and flat. So, the fact that they did an album called Aftermath is doubly appropriate. In fact, I'm developing a theory that the entire works of Jagger and Richards are coded references to gardening.P.S. I am scribbling a new book and doing so so furiously that I fear I shall have to bring the blog down to three posts a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, which is still a lot if you think about it.

It also reminds me of the fantastic passage in the biblical Book of Proverbs, even though here it is the other way around:For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house, In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart. (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.) So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him, I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows. Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee. I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt. I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves. For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed. With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.

{"title": "Slush Funds and Slush Piles", "date": "Wednesday 8 February 2012", "text": "A timely repost from two years ago:London thaws. Snow becomes slush. I nearly went my length today and as I tottered, windmilling my arms like a mad semaphorist and trying to defy Newton, I suddenly thought: \"Why a slush fund?\" And that question only led to \"Why a slush pile?\" A slush pile, dear reader, is the pile of unasked for manuscripts that accumulates in the corner of a publisher's office until some semi-literate work experience girl is asked to read them and post them back wither they whenced. Was the slush in slush pile purely derogotary, I wondered? Or was there some sense in which frozen writing was slowly thawing?Once upon a time slush was just melting snow - either from some Scandy language or simply onomatopoeic - but then in 1869 the Oracle came along. The Oracle was Mark Twain's nickname for a pompous travelling companion he had on a cruise of the Mediterranean. In Innocents Abroad the Oracle describes poets thuslyly:I never see one of them poets yet that knowed anything. He'll go down now and grind out about four reams of the awfullest slush about that old rock [Gibraltar at sunset] and give it to a consul, or a pilot, or a nigger, or anybody he comes across first which he can impose on. Pity but somebody'd take that poor old lunatic and dig all that poetry rubbage out of him. Why can't a man put his intellect onto things that's some value? Gibbons, and Hippocratus, and Sarcophagus, and all them old ancient philosophers was down on poets We can deduce two things from this: that slush must already have been American slang for drivel, and that poets haven't changed much.We imported this sense of slush quite quickly and by 1896 The Times was saying that the campaign against capital punishment was \"steeped in a sloppy and slushy sentimentalism\". Now there's clearly an alliterative bias in the choice of words here right down to the sl, but some sense is implied, I think, of the inchoate nature of slush: ice, water and dirt all mixed together. Inchoate, slushy sentiment is set against ordered, frozen reason. From this we seem to have got the sense of a slushy novel and from that (I'm theorising, of course) we would get the slush pile. However, on consideration I think it more likely that I've been wasting your time. It could simply be that the snow piled at the side of the road is the last survivor of a thaw and so a slush pile would be the ignored and bothersome stuff that has been put to one side waiting to miserably disappear.As for a slush fund, that's quite different. That's fat. There's a rule of etymology that pretty much all words are somehow maritime in origin. As Churchill almost put it \"Don't talk to me about naval tradition. It's nothing but rum philology and the lash.\" [comma deliberately omitted] Anyway, in the eighteenth century sailors used to keep all the fat that boiled off their meat rations. They called it slush, perhaps because it sloshed around. When the ship got to port they would sell all their slush (don't ask me to whom) and the money would be divided among the ship's officers. Hence slush fund.In case you cared - and I am confident you don't - I recovered my balance and, with cautious steps and slow, through London took my solitary way.Everybody gathered round to hear Nelson inventing a wordP.S. Apparently Churchill did not say \"rum, sodomy and the lash\", although he wished he had, and Bismarck never said \"A language is a dialect with a navy\". Ah well."},

Similarly, when an actor has finished his show he washes up i.e. he gets the make-up off his face and cleans the thespian grease from his hands. The OED quotes the following extract from a 1925 article in the World newspaper, which, as the title doesn't suggest, reported New York stage gossip. Here an Italian performer with a trained canary is being fired.‘That guy might be all right if he washed up,’ commented Buck.... Just then the stage manager called out: ‘What will I do with this act, Mr. Ziegfeld?’ ‘Wash up him and the bird,’ said Flo [Ziegfeld] and that was the last of the Italian and his trained canary...

{"title": "How John Donne Invented the Hedge Fund", "date": "Monday 30 January 2012", "text": "I've always, for some whimsical reason, liked to imagine hedge funds as rustic financial institutions based at the edge of fields. Etymologically I am, of course, right. And it's all down to the poet John Donne.Once upon a time there were hedges. Bushy things at the end of your garden and the like. Then came the verb to hedge, which meant to enclose within a hedge. So you could, for example, hedge in your garden.Then, in the early seventeenth century John Donne promised a chap called Sir Henry Goodere that he would send him a letter in verse. He didn't get round to it, and to make matters worse Goodere wrote him one, which meant that Donne really owed him. Or, as Donne put it in an apologetic letter:I owed you a Letter in verse before by mine own promise, and now that you think that you have hedged in that debt by a greater by your Letter in verse, I think it now most seasonable and fashionable for me to break. That's the first recorded usage of the phrase hedge in meaning to secure a bad debt by making it part of a larger one for which better security has been obtained. Although this was the first common financial use of hedging.From that sense of making your debts safe, came the idea of hedging in your bets by betting on more than one horse which pops up in 1672. From there you get the idea of finding two near-identical things at different prices, buying the cheaper and shorting the dearer. And thus the hedge fund.None of which has anything to do with the old slang term of hedge-whore, which denoted a kind of wandering prostitute, not attached to any brothel, who therefore bestowed her favours \"on the wayside, under a hedge\".Someday, I'm going to write a poem in a letter."},

These machines were long prepared and sold by a matron of the name of Philips, at the Green Canister, in Half-moon Street, in the Strand. That good lady having acquired a fortune, retired from business; but learning that the town was not well served by her successors, she, out of a patriotic zeal for the public welfare, returned to her occupation; of which she gave notice by divers hand-bills, in circulation in the year 1776. Also a false scabbard over a sword, and the oil-skin case for holding the colours of a regiment.The OED doubts the good colonel's existence, but to make up for that it provides the following lovely couplet from a poem of 1744:Let not the Joy she proffers be Essay'd, Without the well-try'd Cundum's friendly Aid.Either way, it has nothing to do with the town in France.The Inky Fool completely misunderstood the idea."},

A woman excelling in both beauty and goodness. A word now out of use.Which is a terrible lexicographical statement about the modern woman. According to the OED the word was still going in 1586, which means that if we could get a firm date for this Donne poem of about the 1590s we would be able to pinpoint precisely when it all went wrong for the fairer sex.Go and catch a falling star,Get with child a mandrake root,Tell me where all past years are,Or who cleft the devil's foot,Teach me to hear mermaids singing,Or to keep off envy's stinging,And findWhat windServes to advance an honest mind. If thou be'st born to strange sights,Things invisible to see,Ride ten thousand days and nights,Till age snow white hairs on thee,Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me,All strange wonders that befell thee,And swear,No whereLives a woman true and fair.

{"title": "Guinea", "date": "Monday 16 January 2012", "text": "From the Dear Dogberry page comes the question of Guinea: Guinea the African country, New Guinea the Asian country, and guinea the unit of currency. They are all connected. Let us start, as the word did, with West Africa.There is in the Tuareg languages of north western Africa a word aginaw, which means black people; and it's just possible that this is why the Portuguese decided to call a stretch of the north west African coast Guiné. Just possible, but not certain.What is utterly certain is that Ynigo Ortez de Retez had a great surprise when he got to the Far East. He was a Portuguese explorer who knew the Guiné coast and its black, frizzy-haired inhabitants. But he went further, all the way round Africa to Asia, where people had straight hair and lighter skins until... he got to an island east even of the Malays that was populated by black fellows with frizzy hair, just like the chaps back in Guinea (see picture). He therefore decided to call it New Guinea, and the name stuck. Papua is probably derived from the Malay word for frizzy hair.Back in Africa the British regarded the Guinea coast with envious eyes, partially because it had some lovely gold mines. In 1663 we started to use this gold to make coins with little pictures of elephants on them and one eighty-ninth of a pound of 22-carat Guinea gold in each. One of these coins was therefore worth twenty silver shillings.But the prices of gold and silver fluctuate, and they fluctuate in relation to each other. So when gold was expensive and silver was cheap, you could find that a golden guinea was worth thirty silver shillings and so on and so forth. Eventually, in 1717, the value was fixed at twenty one shillings to one guinea. In modern parlance this means that a guinea is worth £1.05. The last guinea was minted in 1813, however, for reasons best known to nobody, it is still the currency in which racehorses are traded.Notice the little pachyderm at the bottom"},

One of the lords with whom he was negotiating was Cormac MacDermot MacCarthy, the Lord of Blarney.Blarney kept sort of saying that he possibly might help without actually giving any firm promises to Carew. This went on for so long that one day, when Carew was reporting to the Queen, she (according to legend) lost her temper and shouted \"Blarney! Blarney! What he says he never means! It's the usual Blarney!\"Well, that might be the true story. But the legend then gets more complicated with the introduction of the Blarney Stone. This is a stone in Blarney Castle that (apparently) if kissed will give you forever the gift of the gab. However, this appears to be a tradition that only sprang up in the 18th century.Double-however, the whole story about Queen Elizabeth (which is retailed in Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable) is a trifle strange as the OED doesn't record the word before 1766.Which makes me think that the whole thing is a bunch of blarney.The Inky Fool's lapiphilia was getting out of hand."},

{"title": "Crorections", "date": "Friday 6 January 2012", "text": "As Auden said, It is time for the destruction of error.Since the dear old Etymologicon came out, I have been fielding occasional e-mails from those who have noticed five mistkaes. It’s the first one that shames me as it is of proper lexicographic significance.1) In my list of the words and phrases invented by Winston Churchill I for some reason included the term iron curtain. I’ve no idea why I did this as, though Churchill did make the phrase famous, it had been around since the eighteenth century as a safety device in theatres, and had been used to describe the Soviet border from at least 1920. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.None of the rest (to my lackadaisical mind) seem to be too serious, but in the interests of full disclosure:2) I said that beechwood is good for carving because it is soft. However, a correspondent writes:Beech wood is not soft. Speaking as a former professional cabinet-maker, I can attest with blisters to how soft beech wood is not. Botanically, it's a hardwood as it comes from a deciduous tree, and in practice it is good for the sort of carving you describe as it is reasonably tough, not brittle or splitty (splitty is a perfectly good word in common use amongst woodworkers), but most of all it is a) abundant and therefore cheap; b) of no use in ship-building and therefore available; c) fine-grained, diffuse-porous, not ring porous, and pretty consistently straight grained and therefore takes detail well. Compared to oak, it is not very hard, but compared to other commonly available woods in germany in the middle ages (such as pine and spruce) it is indeed pretty rock-like. My guess would be it was chosen for its consistency, detail-holding, and price characteristics.3) I said that Thomas Derrick used his invention to execute the Earl of Essex. Derrick did kill Essex, but as the latter was an aristocrat it was done with an axe. A commenter points out:Essex had the right to have his head chopped off, and Derrick made a complete hash of the job. It took him three strikes before he was able to wave the head about to a great cry of 'God Save the Queen'.4) I said that the Ancient Greeks used poison arrows. However, I'm told that:The ancient Greeks did not as a general rule poison their arrows in war. Some of their opponents did, such as the Scythians, so they certainly knew of the practice.5) I said that outsiders never win horse races, and that favourites always do. A racehorse owner wrote to tell me that this isn’t really the case. The favourite wins about one third of the time. Hundred-to-one shots win slightly less than every hundred races. The remainder is made up by well backed horses who aren’t quite the favourite.I also made an utterly idiotic passing reference to the Maginot Line, implying that it was a WWI thing, when of course it's WWII. This has already been removed from reprints.Anyway, all of the above will be tweaked in reprints so that it will look as though I never made the mistakes at all. If anyone else has noteiced an error, do say."},
{"title": "Blockbuster", "date": "Thursday 5 January 2012", "text": "Somebody has enquired as to what block it is precisely that a blockbuster film busts. Well, I assume that she meant film. But a blockbuster was originally a kind of bomb. The phrase dates from 1942 when the large bombs of more than eight thousand pounds began to be referred to as blockbusters. But of course, that's explosives and not films.The second well-attested meaning of blockbuster is rather stranger. It's a kind of estate agent. Specifically, it was a kind of American real estate agent who would irritate the hell out of white people by selling one house on the block to a black person, which apparently in 1950s and 60s America was somewhat controversial. But the films? Nobody is quite sure. There are two theories. The first is that it's a simple transfer of the explosive power of the blockbusting bomb. There's a line in a detective novel from 1957 that goes:One day I had what seemed to me like a block~buster of an idea for a musical play.However, the term didn't really catch on until the 1970s when spectacular and super-grosser were pushed out of the lexicon and blockbuster took their place.The other theory is just that: a theory. It may well not be true but showbiz folklore says that a blockbuster is a show that is so popular that all the other theatres on the block are bankrupted, and end up bust. This doesn't really work as, presumably, they would profit from the ticketless turnaways who couldn't get into the main show.This amuses me."},

However, the first etymologist to tackle the rasher was John Minsheu (1560-1627).

Ultracrepidarian was introduced into English by the essayist William Hazlitt, but it goes back to an ancient story about the great Greek painter Apelles. The story goes that Apelles used to leave his new paintings out on public display and then hide behind a pillar to hear people's reactions. One day he overheard a cobbler pointing out that Apelles had painted a shoe all wrong. So he took the painting away, corrected the shoe and put it out on display again. The cobbler came back, saw that Apelles had taken his advice and was so proud and puffed up with conceit that he had made the great painter change a detail that he started talking loudly about what was wrong with the leg; at which point Apelles jumped out from his hiding place and shouted: ne sutor ultra crepidam, which approximately translates as the cobbler should go no further than the shoe. Thus ultracrepidiarian is beyond-the-shoe.Anybody wishing to know my opinions on baseball, carpentry or Pop Idol should send a stamped self-addressed envelope somewhere else.Leave it out, son."},
{"title": "A Year and a Day", "date": "Monday 2 January 2012", "text": "All right. I didn't get round to posting anything yesterday for various intensely technical reasons involving gin and smiles. So today's post will have to be on the old rule of a year and a day.A year and a day used to be terribly important in murder cases. If you stab me and I die five minutes later that's definitely murder. However, what if you stab me and I die a month later? Or six months? Or fifty years? At what point does it merely become a long term injury that may aggravate, but cannot be said to have caused, my final coil-shuffling?Until 1996, there was a nice simple rule: a year and a day. If your victim dies before then, it's murder: after that it's just bad manners.Anyway, this takes me back to Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, the opening scene of which occurs:While New Year was so yep [young] that it was new comen,That day double on the dais was the douth [food] served...When in walks a huge green knight who challenges the assembled knights to a game. Any one who is brave enough can come and strike him once with a sword on condition that, in a year and a day (presumably January 2nd), the green knight can do the same to his assailant. Here's the relevant stanza (spelling slightly modernised):\"Nay, frayst I no fight, in faith I thee tell;It are about on this bench but beardless childer;If I were hasped in arms on a high steed,Here no man me to match, for mights so weak.Forthy I crave in this court a Chistmas gomen [game],For it is Yule and New Year, and here are yep [youngsters] many.If any so hardy in this house holds himselven,Be so bold in his blood, brayn [mad] in his head,That dare stiffly strike a stroke for an other,I shall give him of my gift this giserne [battle-axe] rich,This axe, that is heavy enough, to handle as him likes,And I shall bide the first bur [blow], as bare as I sit.If any freke be so fell to fond [test] that I tell,Leap lightly me to, and lach [grab] this weapon;I quit-claim it for ever, keep it as his own. And I shall stand him a stroke, stiff on this flet [floor],Else thou will dight me the doom to deal him another, barlay.And yet give him respiteA twelvemonth and a day;Now hie, and let see tite [quickly]Dare any herein ought say.\"Gawain takes up the challenge, and, without wishing to give too much away, has a bad January 2nd. An oddity of all this is that the father of a friend of mine still used to say \"barlay\" in the playground in Cheshire in the 1950s.Bloody January again"},
{"title": "Glamorous Grammar", "date": "Friday 30 December 2011", "text": "I've been pootling through William Goldman's The Princess Bride and came across this line:glamour is an ancient concept. See \"glamer\" in the Oxford English Dictionary.Well... depends what you mean by ancient as glamer is merely eighteenth century. But the fun thing about glamour is that it's grammar.The glamour of grammar is a bit easier to understand if you consider the French grimoire, meaning book of incantations and spells. Once upon a time, grammar meant any sort of writing or learning. Writing, to those who don't do it, is a mysterious business and so a book of spells and magical incantations became known as a grammar or, by slight French alteration, a grimoire (which has nothing to do with grim).In Scotland such magical grammars started to be pronounced with a L instead of an R, and thus a Scottish word for a spell was a glamer, usually in the phrase to cast a glamer over. Glamer became glamour and was imported back into English English by Sir Walter Scott, usually in the phrase to throw a glamour on somebody.And so by the late nineteenth century, our modern glamour had emerged.So it's just the old L-R confusion.

{"title": "Hob and Nob and Hobnobbing", "date": "Wednesday 28 December 2011", "text": "I have been asked by Twitter whether there is any connection, however tentative and tangential, between hobnobbing and hobbledehoy. The short answer is No, because nobody has any idea where hobbledehoy comes from. However, I did discover the true meaning of hobnobbing, which is much more fun than I expected.The first record of hob nob is found in Twelfth Night where an angry duellist is described thuslyly:He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and his incensement at this moment is so implacable, that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.Hob appears to come from the Old English for have, and nob from have not. However, the meaning of hob nob seems to have shifted slightly to give or take - in this case the knight will either give death or take it, but it is a mortal duel. However, hob or nob quickly became a much more friendly term when combined with a few drinks. If I fill a festive flask and say, 'Here's to you, dear reader of this ridiculous blog,' and you say 'No, here's to you, dear writer of this ridiculous blog,' then we can be said to have toasted each other hob a nob. Hob nob became a shortening of such mutually amicable bibosity, so that in 1762 Oliver Goldsmith could have the line:Hob nob, Doctor, which do you chuse, white or red?And soon such friendly exchanges became known as hobnobbing.Anyway, after nearly a week at number one on the Amazon bestsellers list, I can gaze with monumental patience on The Etymologicon's comfortable lapse to second place. I shall go and unearth for myself a beaker of the warm South, pop the cork and drink a toast to all of you, dear readers. I shall hob, whether you nob is up to you."},

Lurgy is a purely British term for an unspecified but horrid disease that is doing the rounds, and it was invented by comedians. The first recorded case of lurgy appeared in a 1959 episode of The Goon Show Lurgi Strikes Britain*. That episode was written by Spike Milligan and Eric Sykes, so I blame them for my current condition.However, the OED, in an uncharacteristic fit of theorising, suggests that those writers may just possibly have got it from fever-lurdan, or the disease of laziness. Fever-lurdan was a facetious term not recorded after 1806, but its last recorded spelling was fever-largie, so maybe there's something in the connection. I'm either too lazy or too ill to research further.By the way, as a fun bit of trivia, Jimi Hendrix first started taking acid because it made listening to the Goons much funnier. Merry Christmas one and all.*The Goons spelled it Lurgi, the OED has it as Lurgy, presumably to differentiate it from lurgi the chemical process of gasification (which is horribly relevant to me)."},

Illusion had faded from me; I was not touched by any desire for the goods displayed in those golden windows, nor had I the smallest share in the appetites and fears of all those moving faces. And as I listened with Asiatic detachment to the London traffic, its sound changed into something ancient and dissonant and sad - into the turbid flow of that stream of Craving which sweeps men onward through the meaningless cycles of Existence, blind and enslaved forever. But I had reached the farther shore, the Harbour of Deliverance, the Holy City; the Great Peace beyond all this turmoil and fret compassed me around. Om Mani padme hum - I murmured the sacred syllables, smiling with the pitying smile of the Enlightened One on his heavenly lotus. Then, in a shop-window, I saw a neatly fitted suit-case. I liked that suit-case; I desired to possess it. Immediately I was enveloped by the mists of Illusion, chained once more to the Wheel of Existence, whirled onward along Oxford Street in that turbid stream of wrong-belief, and lust, and anger.

You see, bedlam is simply a variant form of Bethlehem. The Wycliffite Bible of the fourteenth century says that Jesus was born in Bedleem, but the King James Version took us back to Bethlehem because it's closer to the Hebrew. However, the two pronunciations were pretty much interchangeable until the end of the sixteenth century.So the chaos and pandemonium of Christmas? That is down to the Hospital of St Mary of Bethlehem for the poor distracted people of London. Distracted in this context means mad, for St Mary of Bedlam was the original English madhouse. As the C17th playwright and inmate Nathaniel Lee put itThey called me mad, and I called them mad, and damn them, they outvoted me.As the Bethlehem/Bedlam hospital was the most famous madhouse in Britain it easily became a byword for any disordered place filled with poor distracted people like me.The reasons for my distraction are legion.

Sample sentence: \"No I don't want to see what's in your grotto,\" she said and scowled misopogonistically.It is, I confess, a rare word and nobody will know what you mean, but with some words incomprehensibility is half the fun. Even more obscurely, the original Byzantine Greek word from which English things misopogonistical derive, had the more specialised meaning of disliking bearded philosophers. It pleases me immensely that the search for truth might be based on facial hair.I came across this misopogonistically whilst trying to do some further research on yesterday's rather hurried post on possible antonyms for bibliophile; you see it's just a couple down from misogrammatist, which means a hater of learning.However, I think the readers' suggestions were much better than anything that the whole history of the English language has produced - a regular gallimaufry of linguistic pearls.

Is there any succinct and recondite term for a book-hater? (It turns out that the poor fellow is related to one, and would feel better if he could put a posh name to this oddity).There is bibliophobia, a dread of books, but that's not quite right as dread differs from dislike. A close dictionary neighbour of bibliophobe is biblioclast, which is somebody who destroys books (particularly the Bible).

Skoob is, of course, just books backwards (and is therefore related to yob and wonk). It's also, oddly, the name of a very good second hand bookshop that lurks under the Waitrose in the Brunswick Centre.But a book-disliker? Perhaps I could name it after somebody. A great literary character who dislikes books. It may be merely lack of coffee, but I can't think of one off hand.I might be inclined to coin the term a Callimachus. Callimachus was an Alexandrian poet whose most famous line was 'a great book is a great evil'. However, that's probably just that he liked short books, as do I, so it doesn't really work.Or maybe a Larkin who once wrote that \"Books are a load of crap.\" Or Bulwer Lytton \"We may live without friends, we may live without books;/But civilised man cannot live without cooks.\"Or... The problem is that those who don't like books, rarely write down their opinions.So I'm stuck with Callimachus as my best offer. If anyone can better that (and I'm sure somebody can) put it in the comments, please. A Skoob tower in Bloomsbury in 1966, photo nabbed from this article."},
{"title": "An Egg Dance", "date": "Monday 19 December 2011", "text": "Over on the Dear Dogberry page, a reader has asked why we have the phrase walking on eggshells when walking on eggs would make much more sense. For myself, I can't understand why you would do either. However, upon investigation I've discovered that walking on eggs was the original version of the phrase. The OED records it from 1734, where as the walking on eggshell doesn't pop up until 1860. A much more amusing variant is a thing called an egg dance, which can be performed at home, but probably not on your best carpet. All you'll need is a bunch of eggs, which you arrange on the floor, and a blindfold, which you put over your eyes. You now dance around trying not to tread upon any eggs however lightly. Egg dancing gets a mention in a sixteenth century play called The Longer Thou Livest, The More Fool Thou Art. Upon my one foot prettily can I hopAnd dance it trimly about an egg.And there's a good description of it from 1801:This performance was common enough about thirty years back, and was well received at Sadler's Wells; where I saw it exhibited, not by simply hopping round a single egg, but in a manner that much increased the difficulty. A number of eggs, I do not precisely recollect how many, but I believe about twelve or fourteen, were placed at certain distances marked upon the stage; the dancer taking his stand, was blind-folded, and a hornpipe being played in the orchestra, he went through all the paces and figures of the dance, passing backwards and forwards between the eggs without touching one of them.As you can imagine, an egg-dance became a byword for any intricate and difficult task, and makes a lot more sense than walking on either eggs or eggshells.

Chīz became a term of approbation used for anything that was the pinnacle of its kind, but it wasn't spelled chīz, it was spelled cheese.

And I want you to buy at least fifty copies each. So, as my ego is as frangible as it is vast, here's a little round-up of what the press have been saying about my baby.First off, The Etymologicon is going to be Radio 4's Book of the Week next week. Every weekday morning at a quarter to ten Hugh Dennis will be reading extracts to an expectant nation, and the whole thing will be repeated at half midnight and be available on the Listen Again thingummyjig. This is also the Radio Times' number one radio choice for Christmas.Anyway, to the papers:\"But this year's must-have stocking filler – the angel on the top of the tree, the satsuma in the sock, the threepenny bit in the plum pudding, the essential addition to the library in the smallest room – is Mark Forsyth's The Etymologicon\"  - Ian Sansom in The Guardian\"I'm hooked on Forsyth's book ... Crikey, but this is addictive\" - Mathew Parris in The Times (who also made it one of his books of the year). \"The stocking filler of the season... How else to describe a book that explains the connection between Dom Pérignon and Mein Kampf?\" - Robert McCrum in The Observer\"The snappy section lengths and the perky writing style, plus the comely jacket-less cover, makes this prime fare for the Christmas market. You can read it through at a sitting or two, or dip in as fancy takes. A perfect bit of stocking-filler for the bookish member of the family, or just a cracking all-year-round read. Highly recommended.\" - Matthew Richardson in The Spectator\"Kudos should go to Mark Forsyth, then, author of The Etymologicon, who has tried to sort out this linguistic mare’s nest and help us see the wood for the trees. Clearly a man who knows his onions, Mr Forsyth must have worked 19 to the dozen, spotting red herrings and unravelling inkhorn terms, to bestow this boon – a work of the first water, to coin a phrase.\" - The Sunday TelegraphAnd then there's all the lovely ones from around the web that I shall bore you with some other time.

{"title": "Homicidal Orthography", "date": "Tuesday 13 December 2011", "text": "I've spent a jolly morning looking at the Murder Map, which is a map of London marking the spot of every homicide, fratricide, patricide, uxoricide &c in London. You can even filter the results by murder weapon. The reason it was such a jolly sight to me was that I appear to live in a small, murderless island. In fact, the only murder round my way was committed with a ligature.Now that surprised me because, as a linguistic sort of chap, a ligature is just something that connects two letters, and I am afraid of no man who tries to kill me with joined up writing.A ligature is... well, it's hard to explain, given that blogspot doesn't allow me medieval script but take, for example, double U. You don't see that written down much do you? Looks a bit odd. Double U is the full spelling of the letter W, because the letter double U is made of two ligatured ues (that's something else you don't see much).Anyway, the reason for my murderous confusion is that ligature comes from the Latin ligare meaning bind. That's why you have ligaments, and medical ligatures which are pieces of thread used roughly like a tourniquet. And if you take some binding string, wrap it round somebody's neck and pull then you have murder by ligature. And if you do that ten minutes walk from me, then I think you're beastly.It's terrifying to think that this is going on only ten minutes walk from my flat."},
{"title": "Oops-a-Daisy", "date": "Monday 12 December 2011", "text": "The other day somebody asked me where the phrase oops-a-daisy comes from. Of course, I didn't know, but I never feel that Ignorance should stand in the way of Opinion, so I muttered something about lackadaisical and tried to look wise. By extraordinary coincidence, it turns out that I might have been right. Oops-a-daisy has a strange and meandering history that goes like this.First, oops-a-daisy predates oops and whoops. Oops only appeared in 1925 and whoops is even younger having stumbled into the language in the 1930s. They're both variants of the original upsidaisy which was something you said to a child as you lifted it up back in the nineteenth century.Upsidaisy is a variant of up-a-daisy which dates back to 1711, also addressed to a child to make him rise. So where does the daisy come from? Well, the OED says compare lackadaisy. You see, words influence each other. When the word bunkum already exists, it encourages people to change hocus pocus to hokum. In the same way, lackadaisy (and lackadaisical) appear to have influenced the formation of up-a-daisy from up. Lackadaisy is formed from lackaday, which is a shortening of alack the day! which means something along the line of curse the day on which something happened, which comes from lack meaning failure, fault, reproach or shame.And thus did a tour through the dictionary pretty much confirm my nebulous and face-saving guesswork. Who needs scholarship when you have bluff?P.S. For anybody who particular wants to hear my brief appearance on Friday morning's Today Programme, the relevant segment can be found here."},
{"title": "Streamline", "date": "Friday 9 December 2011", "text": "If you potter about the business world for even five minutes you're liable to come across the word streamline, often as a verb. This may seem curious, given that streams tend to meander in curvy and inefficient fashion, simply taking the route of least resistance, and heading permanently downhill - all things that businesses try to avoid.Properly speaking, though, the streamline is a very precise scientific idea. It is a situation where the direction of any given particle moving past a surface is equal to the tangent of the curve of the surface at that point.A tangent is, of course, a straight line that touches (tangibly) a curve (as in the picture at the top right). So if an object is of just the right shape and put in a stream in just the right place it will have a minimal deflection of the flow. The word streamline was invented in 1868 and spent the next 65 years as a proper scientific term, appearing only in stern academic papers on inviscid fluid, until it was taken out one night by the poet Stephen Spender, who got the word drunk, took her honour from her, and included her in a bit of a poem about sunset. Now, shamed and denuded of her original sense, she is, I'm afraid, in business.The Inky Fool has a new car"},

{"title": "Meting", "date": "Wednesday 7 December 2011", "text": "A fellow on twitter asked me whether justice was the only thing that can be meted out. The short answer is that other things can be meted [out], and the long answer is that justice is one of the very few things that cannot properly be meted.Tennyson's gorgeous poem Ulysses begins thusly:It little profits that an idle king,By this still hearth, among these barren cragsMatched with an aged wife, I mete and doleUnequal laws unto a savage race,That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.Here, meting is pretty much a synonym for giving. And that could be that unless you remember the responses in the Order for Holy Communion as set forth in the Book of Common Prayer.Priest. Let us geve thanckes unto our Lorde God.Aunswere. It is mete and right so to do.Priest. It is very mete, right, and our bounden duety that we should at al times, and in all places, geve thanckes to the, O Lord holy father, almighty everlasting God.And here, mete is pretty much a synonym for appropriate. So who's right? I always find it hard to choose between God and Tennyson, or even, occasionally, to distinguish the two. It is therefore a great theological relief to me to be able to tell you that they are both right, for they are each giving two extremes of one general meaning. Mete means measure. Or it did once. But then its meaning drifted to something that had been measured, or meted, until something of the right dimensions was mete. And therefore something that was appropriate was mete. That's what's going on in the Communion service. But also if you measure out to a person the amount that is due to him, then you are meting something out. That's why you can mete out punishment. It means that you are giving a sentence that is measured and appropriate to the crime. And here's the problem with justice: justice is that which is appropriate. So if you mete out justice, you are giving the appropriate amount of appropriateness, and then you drown in a vortex of tautology.So the full answer is that you can mete out anything you like - fines, food, sharks or champagne - but you can't mete out justice.At least medioxumate."},

{"title": "Stationary Stationery", "date": "Sunday 4 December 2011", "text": "Those who have never liked the fine distinctions of English spelling will rejoice to learn that the first recorded use of the word stationery, in Nathan Bailey's Universal Etymological English Dictionary of 1727, goes thus:Stationary, Stationers WaresThe -ary -ery distinction was only introduced in the nineteenth century to annoy schoolchildren.But what is it that makes stationery so stationary? Why so still?Well, once upon a medieval time, most books were sold by itinerant tinkers and traders who would set up shop in a different place everyday, or often only on market day. An exception to this rule was the stationarius. This was an official position within a university. A stationarius was given a shop from which to sell books and parchment and the like. This meant that unlike most of his competitors he was a stationary booktrader and thus became known as a stationer. In return for the shop he was required to swear fealty and obedience to the institution.The stationer only slowly became differentiated from the bookseller. It wasn't until 1656 that Blount wrote in his GlossographiaStationer is often confounded with Book-seller, and sometimes with Book-binder; whereas they are three several Trades; the Stationer sells Paper and Paper-Books, Ink, Wax, etc. The Book-seller deals onely in printed Books, ready bound; and the Book-binder binds them, but sells not. Yet all three are of the Company of Stationers.Which hardly clears things up. The distinction didn't really catch on until a hundred years later, and the -ery until a hundred years after that.Hmm"},
{"title": "Foolscap", "date": "Friday 2 December 2011", "text": "Foolscap paper is one of those things that I've never really been sure about and to which I have never devoted even the idlest of my idle thoughts. I had never, for example, noticed that it's a contraction of fool's cap. But it is. That's odd because foolscap is an old paper size. Whenever it's used in the news (and it often is) it's put there to evoke what editors like to call a bygone era filled with dial telephones, morality and rationing. Foolscap was a little bit larger than A4, and once upon a time it bore a watermark depicting a jester's headdress.When it did this is a matter of fevered debate amongst those who care about paper sizes. The earliest known example in England dates from 1659. Indeed, there's an obscure story that during the Commonwealth the republican Parliament replaced the royal watermark that had once appeared on all the laws of England with a fool's hat. But like all the best stories that's probably tosh.There are much earlier fool's caps in German printing, indeed they go back to 1479. This lends some credence to the idea that the fool's cap was introduced by Sir John Spielman who built England's first paper-mill, as the poor fellow was German.Despite his teutonicness he still managed to get a legal monopoly on all paper production in England in 1581 and thus he achieved immortality. Not with his paper, not with his watermarks, but because he managed to be obliquely satirised by Shakespeare. In Henry the Sixth part II, the ridiculous rebels capture a lord and their peasant leader, Jack Cade accuses him thus:Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar school; and whereas, before, our forefathers had no other books but the score and the tally, thou hast caused printing to be used, and, contrary to the king, his crown and dignity, thou hast built a paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian ear can endure to hear. As Shakespeare would have had to obtain his paper from Spielman's foolishly behatted mill one way or another, we can make a shrewd guess at who he had in mind.Incidentally, despite the fact that it's probably about his fourth play, Henry VI part II contains Shakespeare's first truly memorable* line, and it's said by another of the peasant rebels when they're planning what to do once they've seized power:CADE I thank you, good people: there shall be no money; all shall eat and drink on my score; and I will apparel them all in one livery, that they may agree like brothers and worship me their lord.DICK The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.P.S. There's a lovely review of The Etymologicon over at Tom Cunliffe's excellent blog A Common Reader.

Its meaning is pretty much perfectly preserved in the word incendiary, especially incendiary weapons, which still set fire to things. However, the word is also preserved in that to which fire is set, namely the incense that is burnt in the higher kind of church in a thurible.And finally the word is preserved figuratively as a synonym for angry - incensed. This of course merely means that your passions have been fired, your tinderbox sparked and that you're about to explode like an incendiary in a censer."},

Moreover, as nobody has any idea what the word means it immediately establishes that you're a jolly clever person and your disception will therefore carry more weight.As a tidbit of literary trivia, the character who utters the line, Mr Ferdinando Flosky, is a piss-take of Samuel Taylor Coleridge.Nightmare Abbey also contains the wise words: \"You may as well dine first, and be miserable afterwards.\" This is a rule by which I live.P.S.

{"title": "Skinning a Flint", "date": "Tuesday 29 November 2011", "text": "The other day I happened to use the word skinflint, and even as the word was popping out of my mouth, it occurred to me to wonder where on earth it had come from. Does it meant that you're flinty-skinned? Or that you have such a lean and hungry look that it appears that your skin is drawn over flintlike bones?It turns out that neither is the case. Instead, there is a dead phrase whose cadaver lurks in that word. Once upon a time, avaricious people were said to be so greedy that they would skin a flint for its hide. Presumably, back when central heating was expensive and furry animals were abundant, people would occasionally skin dogs and cats (there's more than one way to do this) and, I imagine, even mice and rats in order to save money at the tailor. The absurd pinnacle of such skinning would be the attempt to skin a flint.Daniel Defoe wrote a book called the Complete English Tradesman (1727), in which he warns that a successful merchant is liable to end up with the following reputation:That he has been a Hard-Head, a Devourer, a Jew; for these, and more such are the general Titles by which such Tradesmen are usually distinguished and known; that he will let no Body live by him, that he will skin a Flint, that he will buy cheaper than any Man can fell, and sell dearer than any Man can buy; that he cares not who sinks if he can but swim; that he grinds the Faces of his Workmen, and will hardly let a poor Man live by his Labour: Thus he has got what he has by griping and squeezing of labouring Men; and that it will never thrive with him, and the like.There was even a sister phrase to flay a flint and a later American variant that he would skin a flea for its hide and tallow. All lost and gone to the great phrasebook in the sky.P.S. For those of you who live within striking distance of Islington, I will be along for the author evening at the Waterstones on Islington Green tomorrow (Wednesday) night. Essentially, there'll be mince pies and wine from 5 till 8 and all are welcome and I undertake to sign copies of The Etymologicon with any personalised dedication that your big heart requires.Bring me my best skinning-knife."},
{"title": "Variant Extravaganzas", "date": "Monday 28 November 2011", "text": "The word extravaganza was imported from the Italian to describe an extravagant type of writing that was terribly popular in the nineteenth century. The Victorian stage was filled with extravaganzas, which were defined, by one of their chief exponents, as the whimsical treatment of a poetic subject.Extravaganza was merely the Italian term for an extravagance, and nowadays, of course, you can have an extravaganza of Christmas trees or shopping or whatnot. Anything faintly over the top can be an extravaganza.So far, so fun. But regular readers of this blog will know that I have a penchant and peccadillo for vagant words. You see, the vagant in extravagant just means wandering, and an extravagance was merely a wandering beyond the limits. That means that I've also been able to post on the English words noctivagant (wandering around at night), montivagant (wandering over mountains) and omnivagant (wandering absolutely everywhere). This opens the delightful possibility that if you spent the whole night wandering around it would be a noctivaganza, and that a week's walking holiday in the Alps might count as a montivaganza and so on and so forth.All of this was suggested to me by Paul Norman of Books Monthly who has just written a very complimentary review of my book The Etymologicon, which you can read here (it's on the left of the page).I think the third from the left may be a crafty man."},
{"title": "The Law of the Plinth", "date": "Friday 25 November 2011", "text": "A very observant reader has posted on the Dear Dogberry page asking why there aren't more rhymes for plinth. She observes that:I can't think of anything it rhymes with or even any other word with 'nth' apart from numbers ending in a 'n' when ordering things by position.Now that's not exactly right, and indeed she corrected herself with labyrinth. There's also hyacinth, labyrinth, absinthe (depending on how you pronounce it) and synth. There are even some weakly stressed words like jacinth (a kind of gem) and Corinth. However, that last example might make you notice that all of these words are late imports. None of them derive from Old English.Even the OE-derived words that have Nth, such as month and ninth, once didn't. The Old English for ninth was noneth, and for month was monat. Had you been alive a thousand years ago you wouldn't have found any nth words. Or mth words. Or mf words. The Anglo-Saxons had no umph. This is the long arm of the Ingvaeonic Nasal Spirant Law.Don't worry. Ingvaeonic Nasal Spirant sounds rather intimidating and complex, but it isn't.Ingvaeonic just means Old English, Old Frisian and Old Saxon. These were old languages spoken in Denmark(ish) and then brought to England.A Nasal sound is just one that you can't make when holding your nose. Try it. Pinch your nose and say 'tatty'. Easy, isn't it? That's because T isn't a nasal sound. Now try saying 'man'. Weird, ain't it? Now try saying 'Steve McManaman'. As Jesus of Nazareth almost put it: 'Man cannot say God and mammon when holding his nose.'A spirant is the same as a fricative. It's any sound made by forcing air through a bit of your mouth. So clasp your tongue between your teeth and blow. You should get a Th sound. Put your top teeth on your lower lip and... Ffffff. It's the same for Sssss and shhhh. And, technically, the last sound in Johann Sebastian Bach is also a fricative. So what's the Ingvaeonic Nasal Spirant Law? It's the Law that says that in the Ingvaeonic languages words never end with a Nasal sound followed by a Spirant. Just doesn't happen. And nobody knows why. The Germans do it all the time. The Germans, for instance, say Uns. The Old Germans said Uns. But for some reason, when Old English was being formed, that N got dropped and so we say Us. The Germans talk about a gans, but we have a goose.All of which means, that one observant reader was close to discovering a law of first-millennial linguistics all on her own.I was lounging around on my plinthAnd thought, as I sipped an absinthe,Though some like the guitarI'd rather by farHear the sweet man-made sound of a synth.The which limerick was necessary so I could post this slightly blue-languaged video.This song is particularly funny if you live as close to Exmouth Market as I do."},

But the truly fun thing is not what I've been doing, but the work of a graphic designer and the lovely people at Icon Books who have been Photoshopping the covers of these old books and putting on my revised titles. Would you like to see one? You would? Then go to the bookhugger website where they'll be putting them up all week.Today's dose is Wuthering Heights and Lord of the Rings (which has to do with bread).They're far better quality than this effort of mine, which is explained in this old post."},

Gelett Burgess, who was a writer and humourist and artist etc etc, invented the word blurb, which we all know and dislike, but he also came up with tintiddle.Tintiddle is an English equivalent for esprit d'escalier, or wit that comes too late. It is the perfect comeback that you think of five minutes after the event when, in the French, you are already shuffling forlornly down the stairs. It's also an utterly beautiful word and I intend to revive it, although I fear that, lethologically, I will always remember it too late.And you, sir, are an ass."},
{"title": "Queer Carey Street", "date": "Thursday 17 November 2011", "text": "Those of you who follow the news (and, as Evelyn Waugh said, News is what a chap who doesn't care much about anything wants to read. And it's only news until he's read it. After that it's dead.) will, likely as not, have come across the fabulous outrage occasioned by Robert Peston referring to insolvency as \"Queer Street\".* This has led to lots of people talking about the etymology of the phrase. So I shall throw my proverbial hat into the lexicographic ring.Queer Street first pops up at the beginning of the nineteenth century and is defined in Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue as:Wrong. Improper. Contrary to one's wish. It is queer street, a cant phrase, to signify that it is wrong or different to our wish.However, by the mid-nineteenth century it had come to mean broke, insolvent, penurious and heading for bankruptcy. I would take a guess that this shift in meaning comes down to the Bankruptcy Court which was established on Carey Street in London in the early 1840s. There was certainly a phrase, listed in the OED and Brewers of \"being on Carey Street\" meaning that you were heading for bankruptcy. The OED doesn't record this phrase until the 1920s, but I just found this description of an artist's predicament from the 1880s:For the moment, he keenly felt the disgusting cramped situation of Carey Street, which compelled him to peep at his objects, through the rails of his apartment : for the moment, also, he felt the immediate necessity of procuring the gold talismanic key to give him once more liberty, again to wander amidst the beauties of nature : it was then that MORLAND painted for money...And if I can backdate the phrase forty years, somebody else ought to be able to take it further.So I shall stick my neck out and make a claim for convergence. An existing term, Queer Street, became an alternative name for the site of the new Bankruptcy Court, Carey Street. All of which allows me to use this photograph.It's a rich man's world, but a poor man's heaven.*Phew, what a jormungandrian sentence.P.S. Photographic credits to The Antipodean."},
{"title": "Crimean Clothes", "date": "Wednesday 16 November 2011", "text": "As a little follow up to Monday's post on The Charge of the Light Brigade, it's quite astonishing how many clothes are associated with that single military encounter. The basic shape of the disastrous charge was this: Lord Raglan sent an order to Lord Cardigan who got the order rather muddled and set off on the most famous and most foolish charge of the Battle of Balaclava.Now, Lord Raglan had lost an arm in the Battle of Waterloo and therefore had his coats specially tailored so that the sleeve was sewn on in a line from armpit to neck, rather than out to the corner of the shoulder. This style is known to this day as the Raglan Sleeve.Lord Cardigan liked wearing button-up jumpers. These are known to this day as cardigans.Balaclava is a cold sort of place in winter (the charge took place at the end of October) and so the British soldiers kept warm with knitted woollen coverings for their whole heads, which became known as Balaclava caps and then just as balaclavas: a style now favoured by skiers and terrorists.Incidentally, Lord Raglan lost his arm at Waterloo where he was aide-de-camp to the Duke of Wellington, after whom the boots.The rider is Cardigan, the horse is a jumper."},
{"title": "Waterstones, #inkf, and Piddle", "date": "Tuesday 15 November 2011", "text": "Once upon a time there was a village in Dorset called Piddle. Or, more precisely, it was listed in 1212 as being called Pidela Walteri, which is Latin for Walter's Piddle. Piddle just meant lowland and Walter was, one assumes, the landowner.Anyway, for some reason lost in the mists of medieval time, the Piddle got dropped and the Walter remained. In fact, it started to be called Walter's Farm, or in old English Walter's ton. Then people stopped pronouncing the L in Walter and it just became Water's ton. The important thing was that the people who lived there acquired the surname Waterstone. They had sex and had children who had sex and had children in a long, frenzied line of lust and procreation that led inevitably to the birth of Tim Waterstone in 1939. And his name had nothing to do with either water or stone.Tim Waterstone founded Waterstones bookshops in 1981 and they are now the largest chain of bookshops in Britain. Then all it took was for me to write The Etymologicon and the lovely people at Waterstones to read and like it and a plan was formed. Essentially, I'm spending the day doing a word surgery. The idea is that you tweet a word to me with the hashtag #inkf and I'll do my best to tweet back with an explanation.

All you need to do is tweet with the hashtag #inkf.And just to prove that I'm not making this up, have a look at Waterstones' Twitter page, it's a thing of beauty.As a devotee of Tennyson, I've always been horribly irritated that he's best known for his worst poem: The Charge of the Bloody Light Brigade.For the last century and a half schoolchildren have been oppressed with the lines:Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them,Cannon in front of them....Which brings me to the brunt of my post: the very useful word quaquaversal. Quaquaversal means in every direction. So those three lines could usefully be deleted and replaced with the two simple words: quaquaversal cannon, or, if you wish to keep a remnant of the metre: Cannon quaquaversally.Tennyson actually didn't like the poem much himself and considered cutting it from the second edition of the collection in which it came out. He had only written the wretched thing in a few minutes after reading an article in The Times which mentioned that 'someone had blundered'. He liked the dactyllic rhythm of the phrase and the rest is pseudo-history.Just in case you were wondering, Tennyson knew that most accounts had closer to 700 men involved, but wrote in a letter that 'Six is much better than seven hundred (as I think) metrically'. So the numbers are there for the metre. Also, as a Lincolnshire boy, Tennyson would have pronounced hundred as hunderd, which means that, for him at least, it really did rhyme with blundered.﻿Monday morning with the Inky Fool"},

But then I happened to be reading an article on the formation of Arabic surnames (as you do), and saw the magical words:bint = daughterSo, I hurled myself at the OED and found that bint does indeed come from the Arabic.

So I turned to the OED and found that there is indeed a verb to rabble. Here are the definitions.1 a. To speak or read aloud in a rapid and incoherent way; to gabble; to ramble. b.

Because they were all named by the marauding Vikings who ravaged and raped and pillaged their way around England until Alfred the Great made them stop. In fact, you can work out the line of the Vikings' farthest advance by simply pulling out a map of Britain and searching for the -bys.By was simply the Viking word for town, and if you go to Norway or Sweden it's still the word that those unrepentant marauders use.

However, I did find a rather lovely alternative in Brewer's: Don't put a churl on a gentleman.Churl is an old word for a fool, and before that it meant peasant, and before that, way back in the days of Old Norse when it was spelled karl, it just meant man. That's also where we get the names Carl, Charles, and (oddly given that it means man) Caroline.Even more oddly, Charlemagne is a variant of Charles/Carl and because of that the Czech word for king is kral, the Polish is krol, and the Lithuanian is karalius. So a churl is, etymologically, both a man and a woman, a peasant and a king.And, for what it's worth, I've always said:Beer, wine and whisky:Feeling frisky.Would it be churlish to point out that this song is about an eleven year old?"},

No kipper, he reflected, is ever as good as it smells; how this too earthly contact with flesh and bone spoiled the first happy exhilaration; if only one could live, as Jehovah was said to have done, on the savour of burnt offerings.Now, if you want to make a great smell for your deity what you need is burnt bone, and apparently (I've never sacrificed anyone myself) the best bone to do this with is the os sacrum, the sacred bone. It's at the bottom of your spine and the Romans believed that it was the part that the gods really liked. That's why it's called the sacrum to this very day.If you have a pain in your sacrum, it's called sacralgia. What I like about this is that, etymologically, sacralgia means sacred pain, but really it means a right pain in the arse.

{"title": "Currying Favour and Curried Horses", "date": "Monday 24 October 2011", "text": "It's a little odd that even at the finest of Indian restaurants you can't order a curried favour. In fact, currying favour gets odder the more you look at the phrase. That's because favour isn't favour. It's a horse.Once upon a time, six or seven hundred years ago there was a French allegorical poem called the Roman de Fauvel. It's about a horse called Fauvel who leaves his stable, moves into the biggest room in his master's house, and installs a custom made hayrack.The point of the allegory is that the second the horse appears to be in charge everybody suddenly wants to be his friend. People come from far and wide to groom Fauvel.For some reason this story was immensely popular and got translated into English, with the name Fauvel unchanged. However, the English word for grooming a horse was currying. It's a verb that is, apparently, still used in equestrian circles*. Thus a phrase developed. Anybody who sycophantically went round trying to be nice to a lord was said to be currying fauvel.However, once the old French allegory had been forgotten, the idea of currying fauvel started to look rather odd. What the hell was a fauvel? Nobody knew any more.Confusion about the phrase lasted until 1560 when the Geneva Bible came up with this line:He thoght by this meanes to courry fauour with the worldeIt makes sense. Nobody knew what a fauvel was, but everybody knew that a sycophant wants a favour. So every since then favours have been curried and patronage has been vindalooed.And here is the original favour being curried.*I have never moved in equestrian circles myself.

The pub had two beers available on tap, and on the taps were those little armorial plates that tell you the name and the ABV and other such urgent information. What struck me, though, was that one of the beers described itself as original, and the other described itself as authentic.I, of course, made a fuss. I told the barman that I made a point of only drinking beers that were both. I tried to haggle a reduction, failed and got drunk anyway. However, even in my beers, it occurred to me that I didn't really know what authentic meant. Did it mean real, extant? In which case it would hardly need to be pointed out. Did it mean not fake? Who fakes beer?So, I fled to a dictionary, and of course authentic, etymologically, means something that is by an author, and therefore has authority. So authentic is, or was, roughly a synonym for authoritative and referred to books.It should be remembered here that in the medieval period there were writers and there were auctors. Auctors were the only ones who had auctorite and whose words were therefore auctentyke, from which we get authentic.I have to therefore concede that T-shirts could be authentic or knock-off copies. I would also note very, very strongly, that as I am an author The Etymologicon (which comes out in only a few days time now) will definitely be authentic, although it unfortunately contains no beer.Pre-order it here.

{"title": "Ossian, Oscar, and Ocker", "date": "Tuesday 18 October 2011", "text": "Back in the eighteenth century, European culture was obsessed with the idea of the noble savage, particularly the Celtic variety. They loved the idea of some kilt-clad warrior striding around a misty moor or foggy fen, playing lonely bagpipes and gazing down the glen.There was a slight problem, though: no actual account of a noble Scotsmen had ever been found*. So a wily poet called James Macpherson decided to make one up. He claimed to have discovered and translated an ancient Scots epic about a chap called Ossian. It was a complete fraud, and those parts of it that I've read are terrible, but it was the fraud that the literary world wanted, and they lapped it up.Goethe loved it and mentioned it in Werther. Napoleon was so obsessed with the poem that he carried a copy with him everywhere. He even insisted that his godson (who later became king of Sweden) be renamed after one of the characters in the poem, who had the then obsolete moniker of Oscar.Thus did the name Oscar suddenly become popular all over Britain and Scandinavia.A few decades later an Irish nationalist called Jane decided to give her son the silliest possible old Celtic name she could imagine to fit in with her political principles. So she called him Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde.Oscar Wilde was convicted of Uranian lust in 1895 and the name Oscar took a bit of a hit in its popularity, but only in Britain. In Scandinavia Oscars thrived. And in Australia.In fact, Oscar was such a common Australian name that when, in the sixties, a comedian called Ron Frazer wanted to create a character who would embody all the quintessential Australian virtues of boorishness and barflying, he called him Oscar, or more precisely he used the Australian shortening of the name: Ocker. Here is a video of Ocker in action.As you can see Ocker isn't actually that bad a fellow. However, the word has moved on. Most Australians today are unaware of the original comedy sketches and use the word ocker (uncapitalised) as an adjective to refer to the most boorish, beer-swilling, prawn-barbying, becorked-hatted bush-whacker imaginable. It's the Australian equivalent of redneck.It's therefore an immensely useful word if you wish to abuse Australians in words of their own invention, and who doesn't want to do that?Ocker Oscar*This is unchanged."},

Other horse medicines included horse bane (phellandrium equaticum) which cures horses with palsy, and horse cassia (cassia marginata) which helps with their constipation.However, horse radishes don't cure a horse of anything at all, they're just big. A horse ant is a big ant. A horse cucumber is a big cucumber. A horse mushroom is a big mushroom.

{"title": "Beau Traps and Affpuddles", "date": "Friday 14 October 2011", "text": "So, the rain has stopped and you're strolling along the pavement wearing your best socks when moist disaster strikes. You tread upon a paving stone that looks dry and safe, but it's loose. The stone flicks down and water that was hidden beneath it squirts up and spoils your socks, soaks your shoes, and leaves the hem of your trousers sodden. There is a name for this.In fact, there are two names. Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1811) has this entry:Beau Trap A loose stone in a pavement, under which water lodges, and on being trod upon, squirts it up, to the great damage of white stockings; also a sharper neatly dressed, lying in wait for raw country squires, or ignorant fops.A beau was, of course, a well-dressed young man. So a beau trap is the enemy of good clothing. However, the term has an antiquated feel and there is a more recent alternative. Douglas Adams and John Lloyd once wrote a book called The Meaning of Liff. The idea of the book was that they took British place names and assigned amusing definitions to them....there are many hundreds of common experiences, feelings, situations and even objects which we all know and recognize, but for which no words exist.On the other hand, the world is littered with thousands of spare words which spend their time doing nothing but loafing about on signposts pointing at places.Our job, as we see it, is to get these words down off the signposts and into the the mouths of babes and sucklings and so on, where they can start earning their keep in everyday conversation and make a more positive contribution to society.Anyway, The Meaning of Liff contains this entry for the name of a Dorset village:Affpuddle (n.)A puddle which is hidden under a pivoted paving stone.

I like to keep my promises nebulous.I had always thought that leaving in the lurch had something to do with lurching back and forth, or that political favourite: a sickening lurch to the right.However, sideways lurching is of nautical origin and has nothing to do with being in or out of the lurch. This latter lurch is helpfully defined in John Florio's 1598 Worlde of Words:Marcio, a lurch or maiden set at any game.A lurch is a score in a game, specifically it's a thrashing where one player doesn't win even a single point. If I beat you at tennis by a game to love that's a lurch. In fact, there are all sorts of terribly technical variants. In the game of cribbage a lurch involves scoring 61 before your opponent has scored 31. In whist it's something else, and in some sport it means scoring five before the other player scores one.Anyway, lurch became a term for any uncomfortable pickle or scrape that you might find yourself in. And thus you can have a chap at your lurch, give a chap the lurch, or leave somebody in the lurch.Now, if you're British, go and get yourself a copy of today's Times.

{"title": "Red Herrings", "date": "Tuesday 11 October 2011", "text": "Yesterday, I explained how harking back was to do with calling back dogs who have lost the trail of scent. Harking back is thoroughly necessary when the dogs are following a red herring. Hounds love the smell of a good red herring. Thomas Nashe observed, back in 1599, that:Next, to draw on hounds to a sent, to a redde herring skinne there is nothing comparable.So, if you want to lead a dog astray the best thing to do is to drag a red herring along the ground, thus making a false trail of scent for them to run after. It appears that this was originally done just to give the dogs and horses some exercise. You laid out a herring trail and then went for a jolly good gallop. This from the Gentleman's Recreation of 1697:Now, that I may not leave you in Ignorance what a Train-scent is, I shall acquaint you that it has its Name as I suppose, from the Manner of it, viz. the trailing or dragging of a dead Cat or Fox (and in Case of Necessity a Red-herring) three or four Miles, (according to the Will of the Rider, or the Directions given him) and then laying the Dogs on the Scent.Nineteenth century huntsmen, though, got wilier. They used red herrings as deliberate distractions to train hounds to follow the original scent. They would lay out one scent of proper prey, and then drag a red herring across it. If the dogs followed the red herring they were harked back to the original trail. So in 1836 The Times could write metaphorically that:Mr. Rice called Lord Lyndhurst's intimation that the Government might take off the whole of the stamp duty ‘a false drag—the scent of a red-herring to draw off the hounds’.And thus the modern red herring. There is also a phrase 'Neither fish, nor fowl nor good red herring.' But nobody knows where that comes from at all. And now go and look at this on Facebook: Waterstones are giving away advanced copies of my book! I saw the first copies yesterday and they are more beautiful than all other things on earth.

So Mr Burns' great line \"Release the hounds\" is repeated in much less memorable form in The Tempest, where Prospero sets a pack of ghostly dogs on Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo.A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits, in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about, PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them onPROSPERO Hey, Mountain, hey!ARIEL Silver I there it goes, Silver!PROSPERO Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are driven outThe reason for all those harks of Prospero's is that, though hark can just mean listen up as in Hark the herald angels sing, hark is also a hunting cry. When you want your hounds to set off you shout Hark-away. If you want them to follow the scent onwards you shout Hark forward. However, if they have lost the scent and gone the wrong way, you shout Hark back.In 1882 Robert Louis Stevenson said of a fellow that \"He has to hark back again to find the scent of his argument.\"But these days the original hunting sense has been forgotten, except by very old people who own packs of hounds, like Mr Burns.P.S. And if you want to know the etymological connection between Caliban and the Caribbean, I explained it here."},
{"title": "Uncle Sam of the U.S.", "date": "Friday 7 October 2011", "text": "I sometimes wonder as I post these things, whether everybody else knows this stuff already. But to continue with our theme of uncles, I never realised that Uncle Sam's initials are U.S., or United States; and though nobody is utterly sure of the origin, the OED saysThe suggestion that it arose as a facetious interpretation of the letters U.S. is as old as the first recorded instances, and later statements connecting it with different government officials of the name of Samuel appear to be unfounded.So there. I set off to do a bit of research and started reading an 1816 book called The Adventures of Uncle Sam in Search of his Lost Honour, but aside from the phrase \"Thus ejaculated the chief steward\" it's terribly tedious. It does, though, have a nice bit at the beginning about how important it is for a book to be printed, otherwise:Deeds of fame hard earned in iron fields of argument flutter on to future times, like the treaties of savages, on the tongues of women, mutilated, distorted, exaggerated and defrauded of half their beauty...Which seems a terribly ungentlemanly attitude towards the tongues of women.

{"title": "Bob's Your Uncle", "date": "Thursday 6 October 2011", "text": "As a follow on from yesterday's post on avuncular nepotism, here's a brief account of exactly why Bob is your uncle.It should be noted that there are several theories for this, and a new one is invented every week, but the standard line* is that it refers to the political career of Arthur Balfour. Balfour was Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1902 to 1905, which, given the size of the British Empire, made him pretty much the most powerful man in the world. However, it was not always thus. When he was first elected to parliament in 1874 he was considered a bit of a joke; and when he was suddenly made Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1887, everybody thought that it was rampant nepotism because the prime minister who promoted him was his uncle, Robert Cecil.So, Balfour's easy success was down to the fact that Bob [Cecil] was his uncle.As I said, there are a bunch of other theories, partially because the earliest written reference comes in 1931. However, if you wanted to know what Uncle Bob looked like, you should (probably) see the picture below.*Despite what a citationless Wikipedia article may tell you."},
{"title": "Avuncular and Nepotistic Uncles", "date": "Wednesday 5 October 2011", "text": "Vanity, saith the preacher, vanity! Draw round my bed: is Anselm keeping back? Nephews - sons mine... ah God, I know not! Well - The word nepotism is, literally, nephew-ism; because the Latin for nephew was nepot. However, nepotism gained its current currency from the overactive and sinful loins of the medieval popes. An Italian history of the papacy written in 1667 was titled Il Nipotismo di Roma and it opens thusly:I begin the History of the Nipotismo, from the time of Sixtus the fourth, since he was the first that delivered up Rome and the Popedom in prey to his Nephews.Sixtus the Fourth created 34 cardinals, of which six were his nephews; except that they probably weren't. You see a Pope wasn't officially allowed to have any sons, so, when he did, he would pass them off as his nephews and then show them enormous favouritism, or nepotism. So the primary definition of nepotism in the OED is:The showing of special favour or unfair preference to a relative in conferring a position, job, privilege, etc.; spec. such favour or preference shown to an illegitimate son by a pope or other high-ranking ecclesiastic. They in turn would have illegitimate sons whom they would pass off as their nephews and so on and so forth until the Roman Church had become thoroughly avuncular.That's because avuncular just means like an uncle. So if you treat somebody in an avuncular manner, you behave as though you were a friendly and indulgent uncle. That's why nepotistic (being nice to your nephews) is exactly the same thing as avuncular (being nice to your nephews*).In fact... hmmm... that's a very neat point, but it may be wrong. You see, I just checked, and avuncular, etymologically speaking, means like an avuncul and in Latin an avuncul is a maternal uncle. So perhaps a maternal uncle is kinder because his sister's children are not competing for his own children's inheritance. I don't know anything about Roman inheritance law, but that would make sense. Therefore, both words would have to do with the twisted relationship between uncles and wills. This brings us inevitably to the nineteenth century and the wonderful dramatic monologues of Robert Browning. One of the best of these, and for some reason one of the least known, is The Bishop Orders his Tomb at Saint Praxed's Church, Rome. It's basically the deathbed speech of a thoroughly corrupt medieval priest who, among other things, can't remember which are his sons and which are his nephews. Draw round my bed: is Anselm keeping back? Nephews - sons mine... ah God, I know not! Well - She, men would have to be your mother once, Old Gandolf envied me, so fair she was! What's done is done, and she is dead beside, Dead long ago, and I am Bishop since, And as she died so must we die ourselves, And thence ye may perceive the world's a dream. It's an absolutely bloody fantastic poem and you can read the whole thing by clicking on this link. There's a great bit in it where he's describing an ornament that he wants on top of his sarcophagus:Some lump, ah God, of lapis lazuli, Big as a Jew's head cut off at the nape, Blue as a vein o'er the Madonna's breast...

Biro (1899-1985) was a Hungarian journalist who noticed that newspaper ink dried more quickly than the ink in fountain pens. However, it was too viscous to put the one inside the other. So he and his brother came up with the ballpoint which is known today as the biro, although technically Biro should be capped up as, like Hoover or Photoshop, it remains a proprietary name.As a strange point of linguistic imperialism, Biro was bought out by a Frenchman called Marcel Bich, who started manufacturing Bic Biros. I once bought a Bic Biro and noticed that it said on the side Made in France. What amused me was that this was a French company making a French product and I had bought the Biro in France.

I can just imagine old Professor Dungle pottering about his library, or Mr and Mrs Dungle being the evil family with whom our orphan-hero is forced to live.In fact, though, dungle has a precise and clear meaning. It's a verb and it means to throw something onto a dunghill; once there the thing is said to be dungled.It's worthwhile noticing that a dungled person is liable to end up sharny-faced, which is an old Scottish term for bedaubed with dung. I'm glad I don't live in Old Scotland. However, I also reckon that I could get away with calling somebody sharny-faced and making it sound like a compliment.As we're on the subject of dunghills, I cannot but quote John Lyly's lovely lines:It is the disposition of the thought that altereth the nature of the thing. The sun shineth upon the dunghill and is not corrupted, the diamond lieth in the fire and is not consumed, the crystal toucheth the toad and is not poisoned, the trochilus liveth by the mouth of the crocodile and is not spoiled,This is all terribly true, however the last clause is a bunch of crap:a perfect wit is never bewitched with lewdness neither enticed with lasciviousness.

Umbrella comes from the Latin umbra, or shade, so an umbrella is a little shade, just as a parasol is a protector-against-the-sun, just as a parachute is a protector-against-falling.An eldritch combination of the above words is bumbershoot - which is an American slang term for an umbrella and an utterly lovely word to say. Basically, if you mess up the word umbrella you're as likely as not to get something along the lines of brolly or bumber. Then, if you notice that an umbrella looks a bit like a parachute you can add the chute onto the end and get bumbershoot, which first appeared in 1896. The OED has bumbershoot down as originally and chiefly US.

Take, for example, hanging out. It's a phrase that I would have imagined was invented by surfers in the 1960s. So when you come across it in Dickens' Pickwick Papers from 1837 it feels decidedly odd:Mr. Bob Sawyer, thrusting his forefinger between two of Mr. Pickwick's ribs, and thereby displaying his native drollery, and his knowledge of the anatomy of the human frame, at one and the same time, inquired— 'I say, old boy, where do you hang out?' Mr. Pickwick replied that he was at present suspended at the George and Vulture. Not only was the phrase around, but it was familiar and annoying enough to be parodied. In fact, hang out comes from the idea of hanging out a sign to show that you're there for business. The same thing once struck me when I was reading Great Expectations. Wemmick is miserable and tells Pip:\"It's a bad job,\" said Wemmick, scratching his head, \"and I assure you I haven't been so cut up for a long time.\"Pickwick Papers also contains a character called Mr Phunky, which may be a forerunner of our more modern term. It was only eight years later, in 1845, that a writer called Samuel Naylor was able to pen the immortal line: I do feel somewhat funky.Anyway, here's a recording of an interview with Mr Pickwick."},

Basically, mapmakers put tiny mistakes into their maps so that they can prove that a rival has simply copied from them. So I was wondering whether dictionaries did the same thing. And it turns out that they do.The New Oxford American Dictionary apparently included the word esquivalience as just such a copyright trap. The entry ran:Esquivalience—n. the willful avoidance of one’s official responsibilities ... late 19th cent.; perhaps from the French esquiver, ‘dodge, slink away.’Which is rather appropriate. The trick worked as well. Dictionary.com included the word and credited it to their paper-sister publication Webster's New Millennium Dictionary of English. So the lexicographer's folly exists. Dictionary.com have since removed the word. Mind you, I think esquivalient is rather a beautiful word, and intend to use it for every workshy lollygagger I come across.Of course, in some ways, Blackadder got there first with his contrafibularities.American readers should now recognise Hugh Laurie.P.S.

Barbarians and heathens! I live among barbarians and heathens.Apocolocyntosis is, of course, the act of being turned into a pumpkin, or pumpkinification if you like. Now, I'll admit that it's not that useful a word when you're not talking about Cinderella; but, when you are, it's invaluable.It's also a nice, single, concise word if, for example, a loved one were turned suddenly into a pumpkin and you had to call the emergency services.The origin of the word has nothing to do with Cinderella. It was the title of a satire by Seneca the Younger. When Roman Emperors died they used to go through an apotheosis, which is when you become a god. So Seneca wrote a satire about how when Claudius died the gods wouldn't have him and he was instead sent to hell. Seneca describes Claudius' deathbed thus:The last words [Claudius] was heard to speak in this world were these. When he had made a great noise with that end of him which talked easiest, he cried out, \"Oh dear, oh dear! I think I have made a mess of myself.\" Whether he did or no, I cannot say, but certain it is he always did make a mess of everything. At Claudius' funeral procession they chant this:Mourn, mourn, pettifoggers, ye venal crew,And you, minor poets, woe, woe is to you!And you above all, who get rich quickBy the rattle of dice and the three card trick.And as I'm a pettifogging minor poet who can actually do the three card trick, I find these lines unutterably tragic.The Emperor ClaudiusP.S.

Anyway, a burrito is a little burro and burro comes from Spanish burrico, and burrico comes from Latin burricus meaning horse, and burricus probably comes from burrus meaning reddish brown.But that same Latin burrus went into French as bure meaning dark brown. The French, being a literate lot, started to cover their writing desks with dark brown cloth. These desks became known as bureaus. Soon the office that contained the desk came to be known as a bureau, and when the office and officialdom rule, you have a bureaucracy. And hence the bureaucratic Flying Burrito Brothers."},

Dragging your feet  became fidgeting which in turn became moving the cards around in a pack. Anyway, I was about to shuffle off this mortal coil when on came David Bowie's song Modern Love, and I was suddenly struck by the rhetorical arrangement of the chorus.Anaphora is the technical term for starting a series of clauses with the same words. A classic example is Winston Churchill's speech:...we shall fight in France,we shall fight on the seas and oceans,we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be,we shall fight on the beaches,we shall fight on the landing grounds,we shall fight in the fields and in the streets,we shall fight in the hills;we shall never surrender...It's a simple and surefire winner of a rhetorical technique. Another simple trope is anadiplosis. This is where you use the last word or phrase of one clause as the first word or phrase of the next. Yoda once pointed out that:Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.So what do you get if you cross Winston Churchill with Yoda? You get the chorus of David Bowie's Modern Love, which goes like this:Never going fall forModern love, walks beside me,Modern love, walks on by,Modern love gets me to the church on time.Church on time terrifies meChurch on time makes me partyChurch on time puts my trust in God and man.God and man, no confessions,God and man, no religion,God and man don't believe inModern love.It's a great little chorus and, if you think about, is simply an exercise in anadiplosis and anaphora that comes full circle to the refrain of modern love.And here is a beautiful cover version."},

But I did know that homeo means the same (as in homosexual) and that pathy means suffering, as in pathetic.And, bingo, I was spot on. Homeopathy proper is the idea that like cures like. So a disease may be cured if you give somebody a medicine that would usually cause the same (homeo) symptoms. It was thought up by a chap called Samuel Hahnemannn (1755-1843) who noticed that a kind of Peruvian tree bark that appeared to cure malaria, when given to a healthy fellow, produced the symptoms of malaria.For myself, I'm perfectly convinced by this theory and intend from now on to cure drunkenness by drinking, and undertake to remedy anybody's nosebleed by punching them in the face.I have also discovered that for years I have been using allopathic doctors, that's what homeopathic chaps call the rest of the medical profession.

One of the amazing facts was that disco meant I learn in Latin. The idea, I think, was that this was amusing because it made a disco sound like a school. The fact was technically true, but utterly misleading, in that there is no connection between the two words. However, buried at the bottom was a little gem of truth, because a disco is really a library.The Italian for library is biblioteca, which means book collection. It therefore follows, as surely as night follows day, that the Italian for a record collection should be discoteca.

{"title": "Salient Salmon and Somersaults", "date": "Wednesday 7 September 2011", "text": "The word salient originally meant leaping. It comes from the Latin word salire, which meant leap, and it is one of the many words that were invented by this blog's favourite essayist Sir Thomas Browne in his Pseudodoxia Epidemica: Salient animalls, and such as move by leapingBut from these bestial beginnings, salient was then taken up by mathematicians, who decided to use it for a discontinuous leap in a graph. If the value of an equation changes suddenly then it leaps from one position on the graph to another. Thus is it salient. From that you got the idea of anything that sticks out, and from there to today's meaning of important. However, many of salient's cousins are still jumping about. Salmon, for example, probably also derives from the Latin salire because salmon are always jumping out of the water. And so do the words assault (to jump at) insult (to jump in) and exult (to jump out). Moreover, there is a supersault, although we don't spell it that way anymore, because somewhere on the journey from Latin to English it got corrupted to sobersault and from there to somersault.The Inky Fool inspecting his ceiling"},
{"title": "Zugzwang, the devil, and Beowulf", "date": "Tuesday 6 September 2011", "text": "Zugzwang is a chess term. When any move you can make will land you in more trouble, that's a zugzwang. It's from the German for move (zug) and compulsion (zwang). But try saying it aloud. It's glorious. It has a sort of back-and-forth motion to it.Essentially, zugzwang is the same as being caught between the devil and the deep blue sea, except that it implies more options. The misery and melancholy of the zugzwang can extend in every direction. Incidentally, you may have been wondering why I didn't capitalise the devil in devil and the deep blue sea. The reason is that the phrase has nothing whatsoever to do with his satanic majesty. Like so many phrases it's nautical.The devil of a ship is, according to Smyth's Sailor's Word-Book (1867),The seam which margins the waterways on a ship's hull  Which means that it's a strip on the outside of the ship, just above the waterline. Occasionally, sailors used to be sent down to caulk the devil, which was a very precarious job because you were caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. That, in turn reminds me of one of the finest moments in Anglo-Saxon poetry, with which I shall leave you for today. It's from Beowulf and describes the lake where Grendel and his mother live. Here's Seamus Heaney's translation:A few miles from hereA frost-stiffened wood waits and keeps watchAbove a mere; the overhanging bankIs a maze of tree-roots mirrored in its surface.At night there, something uncanny happens:The water burns. And the mere-bottomHas never been sounded by the sons of men.On its bank, the heather-stepper halts:The hart in flight from pursuing houndsWill turn to face them with firm-set hornsAnd die in the wood rather than the diveBeneath its surface. That is no good place.Which is classic case of elaphine zugzwang.Poor bit of a ship.(Incidentally, I wrote about this song before. Link here.)"},

But it's such a lovely word that I don't mind. I gongoozle with pride. Gongoozler is only recorded from 1904 onwards; but it's probably a lot older. It is, or appears to be, a combination of two Northern dialect words for stare - gawn and gooze - which must somehow be related to gaze and gawp. According to the OED, gongoozler was originally much more specific and meant \"an idler who stares at length at activity on a canal\". Luckily, I have just moved house and am now only ten minutes amble from the Regent's Canal. So I can gongoozle to my heart's content.

Buoy itself comes from the Old French word boie meaning chain, because buoys are chained in place. This means that a buoyant personality is technically a shackled one. What's odder is that if somebody was a prisoner they were emboie, or chained up. This meant that boy was a name given to prisoners, then servants, then peasants, and then young males in general.

The same principle applies to an actor who goes to the theatre. He* will see the lighting, the smoothness of the entrances and exeunts, the clarity of the delivery, and the blocking. A show always looks different from backstage, and, once you have seen the greenroom, the set will never be the same again.All of which is a long way round of recommending that you read this article by Stephen King on the Harry Potter novels. It's thoughtful and clever, and, most of all, it is one craftsman's take on the work of a fellow craftperson.

As a chap pointed out in 1578:The smal Raysens which are commonly called Corantes, but more rightly Raysens of Corinthe.Oddly, the S was on the end to make it sound like the Greek Corinth; but then people got the mistaken idea that it was there because the word was plural.

All my finest fancies and most recondite research has been held back and stored up in a beautiful, beautiful book.So, though I say that the blog's become a book, it's almost all new stuff with occasional posts woven into the weft and woof. Basically, it's about the links between words and phrases that you never knew about: the etymological connection between the Rolling Stones and Elizabethan horticulture or between California and the Caliphate. It's like this blog, but you can give it as a Christmas present.It will be coming out in Britain from Icon Books, in North America from Corinthian and from somebody else in Australasia, and I think even India (although I must do some more research). Moreover, it has a beautiful red cloth cover and the title is in gold and it is, in short, the most beautiful thing that has ever been devised by man, beast or deity.It's released on November the third just in time for all your Christmas shopping, but you can (and will) pre-order it now. It's on Amazon.

{"title": "Pot Shots", "date": "Wednesday 24 August 2011", "text": "I was watching the telly yesterday and there was a man in a blue flak jacket talking about snipers taking pot shots. He was concerned about this because he might be killed; I was concerned because I didn't know why pot shots were called that. I suspected that it had something to do with snooker. How wrong I was.The term goes back to hunting. There are two kinds of hunter: the sportsman who kills merely for the pleasure of ending another animal's life, and the hungry hunter who kills things for the thoroughly base reason that he wants to put them in his cooking pot and eat them. In the eighteenth century this latter was called a pot hunter.As somebody anonymous put it in an 1825 tract on bull baiting:There's nothing a regular Shot would be sooner chafed at than being called a Pot-hunter.What makes pot hunters so despicable is that they kill things at the wrong time of year. They are so hungry that they can't even wait for the glorious twelfth until they start shooting. Instead, they potter around firing pot shots at animals that they intend to eat, this new term popped up in 1839.From there it was a trifling step to start using the term for any opportunistic bit of gunfire, and then to capricious insult or heckle. And that's how you get to the snipers of Tripoli taking pot shots, presumably with the intention of cannibalism."},

The first known use is in a poem by John Davies about Penelope Rich* who in the course of her unhappy marriage:...didst express what Art could never show, The Soul's true grief for loss of her Love's soul; Thine Action speaking-passion made, but O! It made thee subject to a jail's control. But, such a jail-bird heavenly Nightingale, For such a cause, sings best in greatest bale. But in the 350 years since that poem was written the idea of an actual bird had been lost. Leiber saw it and revived it. The same sort of idea was at work when, not content with calling a chap a hound dog, Leiber then extended the metaphor to other aspects of a canine life:You ain't nothing but a hound dogHanging round my door.Well you can wag your tail,But I ain't going to feed you no more.That was in the original Big Mama Thornton version, and when Mr Presley covered the song, it was changed to catching rabbits.And I shall leave you with a lesser known example of Mr Leiber's genius.I've tried this.

What if the Normans had lost the battle of Hastings. What would the English language look like? Obviously, it's a bit of a silly question as all sorts of other things might have happened or not happened and so on and so forth. Nonetheless, it's a fun idea to muck around with, and somebody has been doing exactly that. For reasons unknown to me, somebody appears to have been re-writing Wikipedia using only words of Anglo-Saxon origin. It's fantastic: not simply because it's a fascinating linguistic feat, but also because any writing that follows a strange rule ends up being a good read. For example, in the article on the history of the USA (or Banded Folkdoms of Americksland) you have people moving westward in search of \"thrivedom\" and a war of \"Lonestance\".

Therefore, anyone or anything that distracts you while you're trying to write is a musomastix. Mastix was the Ancient Greek word for whip, and, back in the sixteenth and seventeenth century inventing -mastix words seems to have been a popular sport. A select few plucked from the OED are:Popomastic - Inimical to the PopeHistriomastix - An enemy of actorsInfantomastix - Somebody who agrees with St Augustine that unbaptised infants go to HellFemale-mastix - Somebody who writes denunciations of womenThe great thing is that you can just make a up a mastix word of your own. All you need is a prefix. So you could be a twittermastix, or workomastic, or practice gymmastix.Confusingly, mastix can occasionally be the other way round. A theomastix is God's appointed punisher, somebody who wields God's whip for Him, rather than somebody who tries to whip God.Anybody who does carry a whip, whether for reasons theological, equestrian or voluptuous, is, by the same root, mastigophorous.I shall now leave you with hospitality-management advice from Hamlet:...use every man after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?

{"title": "Joyce and Particle Physics", "date": "Tuesday 16 August 2011", "text": "Three quarks for Muster Mark!Sure he has not got much of a barkAnd sure any he has it's all beside the mark.Quarks, the fundamental particles from which protons and neutrons and the like are made, have two very peculiar qualities. First, they're pronounced kworks. Second, they were invented by James Joyce. The two are connected.As any fule kno, the word atom means unsplittable in Greek. It was then discovered, to the dismay of etymologists everywhere, that the atom could be split into neutrons, protons and electrons, and then these particles were themselves subdivided into quarks, courtesy of James Joyce. The new fundamental particle was actually thought up in the sixties, two decades after Joyce's death. But Murray Gell-Mann, the physicist who had the idea, was a James Joyce fan:In 1963, when I assigned the name \"quark\" to the fundamental constituents of the nucleon, I had the sound first, without the spelling, which could have been \"kwork\". Then, in one of my occasional perusals of Finnegans Wake, by James Joyce, I came across the word \"quark\" in the phrase \"Three quarks for Muster Mark\". Since \"quark\" (meaning, for one thing, the cry of the gull) was clearly intended to rhyme with \"Mark\", as well as \"bark\" and other such words, I had to find an excuse to pronounce it as \"kwork\". But the book represents the dream of a publican named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker. Words in the text are typically drawn from several sources at once, like the \"portmanteau\" words in \"Through the Looking-Glass\". From time to time, phrases occur in the book that are partially determined by calls for drinks at the bar. I argued, therefore, that perhaps one of the multiple sources of the cry \"Three quarks for Muster Mark\" might be \"Three quarts for Mister Mark\", in which case the pronunciation \"kwork\" would not be totally unjustified. In any case, the number three fitted perfectly the way quarks occur in nature.Long-serving readers of this blog will know that James Joyce also came up with Hogwarts.You spoof of visibility in a freakfog."},

Bill Clinton's press secretary managed it too. Whilst talking about the economy in 1995 he said:They happen to produce huge billion dollar differences over seven years in the federal budget, which is why they become fairly incendiary as the debate goes along. But if you—as a practical matter of estimating the economy, the difference is not great. There's a little bit of floccinaucinihilipilification going on here. The etymology is quite simple: it's four Latin words that all meant worthless: flocci means a tuft of wool (as in floccilation which I wrote about here), nauci means trifle, nihil means nothing and pili means a hair. These were all synonyms to the Romans, and were listed together in a standard Latin textbook of the eighteenth century. Hence the word. There's a related verb, floccipend, which means to regard as insignificant.

This is probably the reason that Dutch explorers called them stutterers or Hottentots. If you want to read some other theories about the etymology follow this link.The word Hottentot spread among European languages, probably just because it's such a lovely word to say aloud, and thus it got into German. The German language is remarkably open to the formation of compound words, and making up long silly ones is something of a parlour game beyond the Rhine. So, though the word was only invented as a tongue twister, Hottentottenpotentatentantenattentat is a perfectly viable German word. It means the assassination of the aunt of a Hottentot pontentate. Tante is aunt and attentat is assassination. It's 36 letters long, but only uses 7 letters to get there.

However, that means it's kingly either way because the family name Corderoy comes from the French coeur de roi meaning heart of a king.Oddly, the French don't call it corduroy or corde du roi, instead they called them king's cords, meaning that they had borrowed the English French term and translated it to make a French English one. Corduroy was an English invention and was manufactured in Manchester, which is why the Germans used to call it Manchesterstoff, which sounds a lot less regal."},

{"title": "August August", "date": "Monday 1 August 2011", "text": "Welcome, dear reader, to August, the most august month of the year. The month is stressed on the first syllable and the adjective, meaning grand, is stressed on the second. But they both derive from exactly the same place.Gaius Octavius Thurinus was posthumously adopted by Gaius Julius Caesar and changed his name to that of his new dead dad. Then, in 27 BC, the Roman Senate awarded him the honorific name Augustus, meaning venerable - something akin to your majesty. That's the word from which we get the word august, meaning grand.So Gaius Octavius Thurinus ended up being called Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus. Then in 8 B.C. the Roman decided to rename the month Sextilis in his honour. And that's where we get the month of August. For some reason the month is a trochee - August - and the adjective is an iamb - august. Another word from the same root is augment which is also stressed on the second syllable.The point about all these stressed syllables is that you can arrange them in patterns, for example stressed and soft syllables alternating. So, in iambic pentameters:Augustus's augustness was augmentedThe day the month of August was invented.I am monarch of when I surveyMy right there is none to disputeTo September's first day from JulyYou will find that my name is the root."},

{"title": "Fanfreluching, Biscoting and Synonymia", "date": "Wednesday 27 July 2011", "text": "Way back in the mists and fogs of time, (before standardisation of measurement) weights and distances and everything else would vary from country to country. For example, the leagues around Paris, which were marked by stones at the roadside, were much shorter than those everywhere else. Rabelais (C16th) had an ingenious explanation for this and I'm going to reproduce the whole thing here, simply because of the extraordinary words that were invented by the (C17th) translator, Thomas Urquhart. I shall put them in bold, just for fun....in old times countries were not distinguished into leagues, miles, furlongs, nor parasangs, until that King Pharamond divided them, which was done in manner as followeth. The said king chose at Paris a hundred fair, gallant, lusty, brisk young men, all resolute and bold adventurers in Cupid's duels, together with a hundred comely, pretty, handsome, lovely and well-complexioned wenches of Picardy, all which he caused to be well entertained and highly fed for the space of eight days. Then having called for them, he delivered to every one of the young men his wench, with store of money to defray their charges, and this injunction besides, to go unto divers places here and there. And wheresoever they should biscot and thrum their wenches, that, they setting a stone there, it should be accounted for a league. Thus went away those brave fellows and sprightly blades most merrily, and because they were fresh and had been at rest, they very often jummed and fanfreluched almost at every field's end, and this is the cause why the leagues about Paris are so short. But when they had gone a great way, and were now as weary as poor devils, all the oil in their lamps being almost spent, they did not chink and duffle so often, but contented themselves (I mean for the men's part) with one scurvy paltry bout in a day, and this is that which makes the leagues in Brittany, Delanes, Germany, and other more remote countries so long. I'm quite sure that you can guess at the meanings as efficiently as the OED does. What I particularly love in this passage is that the saucy and preposterous verbs are all presented in pairs, and that the second verb of each adds nothing significant to the meaning. Chinking and duffling are, I assume, pretty much the same thing. This rhetorical figure, called synonymia, is very beautiful if used sparsely and sparely.Synonymia is also used on the nouns of the passage: \"brave fellows and sprightly blades\" and \"as weary as poor devils, all the oil in their lamps being almost spent\".Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some important fanfreluching to attend to. I may even attempt to biscot a biscuit.There was a French-Canadian children's programme called Fanfreluche.Don't ask me why."},

{"title": "The Four Corners of the Earth", "date": "Friday 22 July 2011", "text": "And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.So said Isaiah (11v12) and it's rather odd, because at first sight it would appear to contradict the newfangled theory that the earth is round. When you think about it more, though, it becomes yet odder, because it seems to suggest that the earth is not simply flat, it's square. So did the ancient Hebrews believe that the earth was square? No. The Hebrew word here is kanaph which means, among other things, quarter. It's the four quarters of the earth: North, South, East and West.So were the sixteenth century translators of the Bible twisting things to make it look as though the earth was square? No. Back then corner didn't have to mean corner in the modern sense. It could also have this definition from the OED:...a region, quarter; a direction or quarter from which the wind blows (obsolete)Winds could come from different corners, meaning quarters or points of the compass. So in the gulling scene in Much Ado About Nothing you can get this exchange:LEONATO No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.BENEDICK Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?It's hard to find any civilisation that ever definitely believed the earth was flat. Not only did the ancients know it was round, but a clever chap called Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the earth with an error of only 2%.The Medievals knew it too. The Travels of Sir John Mandeville* (C14th) says clearly that \"the world is quite round\" and \"those men who live right under the Antarctic Pole [star] are foot against foot to those who live right below the Arctic Pole [star], just as we and those who live at our Antipodes are foot against foot.\" Because antipodes means foot against foot.Mandeville then writes:I have often thought of a story I have heard, when I was young, of a worthy man of our country who went once upon a time to see the world. He passed India and many isles beyond India, where there are more than 5,000 isles, and travelled so far by land and sea, girdling the globe, that he found an isle where he heard his own language being spoken. For he heard one who was driving a plough team say such words to them as he had heard men say to oxen in his own land when they were working at the plough. He marvelled greatly, for he did not understand how this could be. But I conjecture that he had travelled so far over land and sea, circumnavigating the earth, that he had come to his own borders; if he had gone a bit farther, he would have come to his own district. But after he heard that marvel, he could not get transport any farther, so he turned back the way he had come; so he had a long journey! Afterwards it happened that he went to Norway, and a gale blew him off course to an island. And when he was there he knew it was the island he had been in before and heard his own language, as the beasts were being driven. That could well be, even if men of limited understanding do not believe that men can travel on the underside of the globe without falling off into the firmament. For just as it seems to us that those men there are under us, so it seems to them that we are under them. The truth is out there.*One of my favourite books."},
{"title": "More Seldom", "date": "Thursday 21 July 2011", "text": "Here's a little bit of poetry by E.E. Cummings (corrected for punctuation and missing capitals)Love is more thicker than forget,More thinner than recall,More seldom than a wave is wet,More frequent than to fail.i quote it only because there was a question on the Dear Dogberry page as to whether anything could happen more seldom.Seldom is usually an adverb, like often. So let's have a look:I often wash.I wash more often.Compared to:I seldom wash.I wash more seldom.Oooh no! Can't do that. However, in America seldom is often used as an adjective. In fact, Shakespeare adjectivised it in the sonnets:Blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.That's how Cummings seems to be using seldom in the poem above, as a straight synonym for rare, not rarely. The line means something like \"Waves are very wet, and love is very rare; indeed the rareness of love is greater in extent than the wetness of waves\". However, more still feels awkward when applied to adjectives of diminution. As in:Alice was more small now.The pile is more little.All of which leaves you with two options: you can be very simple, reasonably simple, or extraordinary.The very simple solution is to replace more seldom with less. So \"I washed less\".The reasonably simple is replace more seldom with more rarely. This still has echoes of awkwardness because it sounds like \"more small\" etc. So if you don't want to be extraordinary, you should just add -er and -est. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu did this back in 1748 when she wrote:Complainers are seldom pity'd, and boasters yet seldomer beleiv'd.And Mark Twain kicked all common usage out of the door when he wrote that:The seldomest spectacle on the Mississippi to-day is a wood-pile.And what Montagu, Cummings and Twain have done is seldomly utterly wrong. Here's that poem in full:Love is more thicker than forget,More thinner than recall,More seldom than a wave is wet,More frequent than to fail.It is most mad and moonlyAnd less it shall unbeThan all the sea which onlyIs deeper than the sea.Love is less always than to win,Less never than alive,Less bigger than the least begin,Less littler than forgive.It is most sane and sunly,And more it cannot dieThan all the sky which onlyIs higher than the sky.The only pop song I can think of that contains the word seldom.P.S. I've written about seldom before here."},
{"title": "Poop-Noddy", "date": "Wednesday 20 July 2011", "text": "A poop-noddy is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as:Sexual intercourse (rare)I don't know about you, dear reader, but I'm planning never to have sex again, it's pure poop-noddies from here on in. However, the origin of the word is rather curious. The OED refers you to noddypoop and noddypoop is simply a synonym for noddypoll.Now a noddy is a fool and a poll is a head. That's why you have poll tax (a tax per head) poleaxe (an axe used for chopping heads) and tadpole (toad-head). So what has any of this got to do with sex?Well, there's a sort of clue in Shakespeare's Pericles. There's a scene where two people who run a brothel are discussing how drab and diseased their prostitutes are:Pandar: Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o' conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, that lay with the little baggage.BOULT: Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat for worms. But I'll go search the market.You've definitely got a sexual context here, but poop seems to mean gave him syphilis, rather than sex. So I'm going to take a guess that poop-noddy isn't sex exactly, that it is, in fact, the act of cuckolding somebody. So if you have sex with somebody's wife you are pooping her noddy of a husband.I could be wrong though. It could be to do with poop decks, which are owned by bad DJs.Supply your own caption.P.S. Why do elephants have big ears?Because Noddy won't pay the ransom."},
{"title": "The Pitying Printer", "date": "Tuesday 19 July 2011", "text": "Right. A post about a bodhisattva called Avalokiteśvara, and his relationship to my godawful printer.Avalokiteśvara embodies the compassion of all the Buddhas, which, I'm told, is one hell of a lot of compassion. At least a metric ton of the stuff.Ava means down; lokite means looking; and vara means lord. So Avalokiteśvara is the Lord Who Looks Down, and the thing that he usually looks down upon is human suffering and lamentation. That's why*, when the Chinese took up Buddhism they rendered his name as Guanshiyin which means He who perceives the lamentations of the world.This brings us to the utter and delightful insanity of the Chinese name taboos. There was, of late, a popular bumper sticker in America that said \"The only Bush I trust is my own\". There were other such witty variants. The idea was that by using the president's name in some amusing context you make the president himself look silly. What George W. Bush should have done (and would have done had he come to me for advice) would be to make it illegal on pain of decapitation for anyone ever to use the syllable bush.That would include ambush, bushells of wheat and, of course, bushwhacking. That way nobody can make a rude pun about you.This policy was pursued by the Chinese emperors of old. There was an absurdly liberal emperor called Shimin who said that you only needed to avoid saying shimin, and that Shi and Min on their own were all right. He even went so far as to employ a chancellor called Li Shiji, which shares a whole syllable with his name. Fortunately for the dignity of the imperial office, his son repealed the law, had it include the last seven generations of emperor, and made the chancellor change his name to Li Ji. Nobody in China was allowed to write the syallable Shi. This had obvious consequences for our bodhisattva Guanshiyin, or Guanyin as he was called from then on.It should perhaps be noted at this point that Guanyin is rather androgynous. Though Avalokiteśvara is usually a he, Guanyin is usually a she. And it was in this feminised form that Guanyin arrived in Japan, where her name was altered slightly to Kwanon, which sounds similar if you think about it.This brings us inevitably to the invention of the camera. In 1934 a Japanese fellow by the name of Goro Yoshida started manufacturing 35mm cameras. He decided to call his company after the all-compassionate bodhisattva, and so the Kwanon camera began. Here's an original logo.Kwanon started to do rather well. They cornered the Japanese market and then started trying to sell their products in the West. However, we westerners find Kwanon a bit of an odd-looking mouthful. So the poor bodhisattva (who, you will remember, had already lost a shi to an emperor) was stripped of her W, and had her K changed to a C. That is why you can still buy Canon cameras to this day. You can also buy Canon printers that break down and run out of toner and jam their paper and take hours to print or cancel.  However, once you know that, ultimately, Canon means Hearing the Screams of Humanity, this suddenly seems rather appropriate.So why is my printer not handy to use?*Although there are some rather dull complications to this."},

A quick check in the dictionary told me that a qualm could be the cry of a raven.

In fact, a qualm was anything that was monstrously and bloodily horrific. A qualm-house was a torture chamber, a qualm-stow was a place of execution.Then, in the sixteenth century, it started to mean a period of suffering, like a bout of fever. Then it began to mean a brief illness, and then a faint feeling of discomfort. And it's from that last meaning that we get the modern ever-so-delicate qualm of conscience.This means, that you can have no qualms about committing qualms.Now, I'm off to a qualm-house to feel qualmish.Many qualms and none"},
{"title": "Unsteadily", "date": "Friday 15 July 2011", "text": "I was reading a bestseller the other day, or rather I was trying to. But I couldn't. I'm going to try to explain why I couldn't by studying only one word of the whole book. This doesn't mean that the word (which came on page 39) was the novel's only fault, but it was a representative fault. So here goes. Here's why I couldn't read the novel. The narrator is on a boat and...I jammed my hands in my pockets, hunched my shoulders up around my neck and crossed unsteadily to the starboard side.The word that made me wince was unsteadily. Not that I have anything against unsteadily per se. Fine word. It was the placing of unsteadily within the sentence that I couldn't stomach. You see, try as I might, I can't read that sentence aloud.By that I mean, quite specifically, that if I were chatting in the pub and (for some weird reason) trying to pass off the words of the novel as my own, it wouldn't work. It would sound odd.When I was learning to drive, my driving instructor had this irritating way of talking. He would say:I would like you to proceed to the junction where you will turn to the left.Of course, nobody speaks like that naturally. So when you hear the words coming out of somebody's mouth it sounds odd. You get the same thing when you phone up customer service lines and the chap says \"In order to redirect your call more efficiently I'd like to ask you three questions.\" It's hard to identify what's wrong with that sentence, but you know that he's reading from a script, which is infuriating because, when you start to make your complaint, instead of helping he just keeps reading from the damned script until you want to strangle the little waste of skin and bury his body at sea.The same thing happens with novelists.... and crossed unsteadily to the starboard side.I could say:And crossed to the starboard side unsteadily.I would be happier with:And crossed to the starboard side - unsteadily.You see, an adverb like that needs to be set off. In spoken English it never just qualifies a verb in the way that a standard adjective does (I saw a brown dog). If you use an adverb like unsteadily at all you put emphasis on it. So I would be happy as Larry with:And crossed (unsteadily) to the starboard side.I wouldn't have to use parentheses, commas might do, but parentheses give you a far firmer idea of how, in the middle of the sentence, I pause for a split second and then raise my eyebrows as I say unsteadily. There's a change in the tone of my voice, and in the pitch. Try it.And crossed [pull face, look up, make hand gesture] unsteadily [resume normal tone of voice] to the starboard side.That works.In the end, though, I'd be much more likely to say staggered.Some writers say that they never use adverbs. However, never is an adverb. I'm not objecting to adverbs by themselves. Just this one right here.Nor am I merely being snobby about a bestseller. I read all seven Harry Potter novels without ever coming across an unnatural sentence like this. You see, it's very easy to avoid writing unnatural English: just say the words quietly as you type them. That's what I'm doing right now, and though I probably look a trifle insane, it keeps my prose natural and therefore convincing. This is how I talk. This is my voice.(Incidentally, Raymond Chandler once said: \"I'm caught talking to myself quite a lot lately. They say that is not too bad unless you answer back. I not only answer back, I argue and get mad.\")Now, there's a premise underlying all this that you may object to: does all prose have to correspond to spoken English? No. But it has to correspond to something. You might, for example, want to sound biblical. In that case you can write:I did cross the boat: yea even unto the starboard side did I cross unsteadily.Or you could do Shakespeare, or romantic poetry, or Dickensian/Brownian intricacy:I attempted to cross to the starboard side of the craft, an exericse which, due to the obstinate periconfluctuations of the ocean, could be accomplished only in a manner that, had it been witnessed by the Leaning Tower of Pisa itself, would have been scorned for the wild and omnidirectional tiltings of my gait.I'm fine with that. There's a voice there. It's not a voice in which anybody on earth has ever spoken, but it's a fully conceived and consistent voice that I can hear in my head, but...And crossed unsteadily to the starboard side.Who? What? The narrator is an Englishman, so this isn't some twist of the American or Australian English that I don't get. It's just unnatural. It's like saying:Proceed to the crossroads and, when instructed, take the second turning to the right.Me, writing this post."},

Powdered rhino horn was believed to be an aphrodisiac and so black rhinos in particular were hunted to near extinction.As an interesting scientific aside, I met a chap who runs a reserve for black rhinos in Africa somewhere. He had gone round the reserve sedating rhinos, drilling a hole in their horns and implanting a microchip so he could track them if they were poached. The result of this was that he ended up with a fair amount of pulverised rhino horn. He powdered it, drank it all and waited. There was no effect.Anyway, this chap was of the opinion that what had really saved the rhino from poached extinction was not the nature reserves or the microchips, but Viagra. Nobody needs or wants rhino horn any more, because they've got a drug that actually works.Nobody is quite sure where the name Viagra comes from, but it seems an awfully odd coincidence that vyagra is the Sanskrit word for tiger. This would mean, if true, that the tiger saved the rhinoceros.However, even if Viagra has saved the rhino, it has destroyed something far more beautiful.

It's an economics term, but I can think of at least a thousand non-economic situations in which it could usefully be used, and not all of them are obscene.It comes ultimately from the Greek ophelimos, which meant useful, and is therefore vaguely related to Ophelia, which meant help. Nobody is sure why Shakespeare decided to name Hamlet's bit of fluff Ophelia, but the best guess is that he simply made a mistake. There's a Ben Jonson play in which there's a nymph called Apheleia.The fourth, in white, is Apheleia, a nymph as pure and simple as the soul, or as an abrase table, and is therefore called Simplicity.As Ophelia in Hamlet is a simple, innocent nymph, this makes a Lot More Sense. And as Shakespeare was a good friend of Jonson's, and was even godfather to Jonson's son, there could well be a connection, even though Jonson's play came after Hamlet. The explanation has ophelimity.Here is Ophelia's lack of ophelimity illustrated:"},

{"title": "Jane Austen and Broken-Hearted Octopuses", "date": "Friday 24 June 2011", "text": "In Martin Amis' novel Other People there's a girl whose only knowledge of life comes from reading the novels of Jane Austen.She read The Jane Austen Gift-Pack. The six stories it contained spoke more directly to her than anything else had done. The same thing happened in every book: the girl liked a bad man who seemed good, then liked a good man who had seemed bad, whom she duly married. What was wrong with the bad men who seemed good? They were unmanly, and lacked candour, and, in at least two clear instances, fucked other people.This limited experience of life is a problem when she has to lie to the police:'How old are you . . . Mary Lamb? Do your parents know what you get up to?''I'm in my twenty-fifth year,' said Mary carefully. 'My parents died.''Of what?'Mary hesitated. 'One of consumption,' she said, 'the other of a broken heart.''People don't die of those things any more. Well they do, but we call it something else these days.'Actually, we don't. A cardiologist friend of mine told me that, just as it is possible to tug on somebody's heart-strings, so it is medically possible to be broken hearted. It is actually called broken-heart syndrome and involves the sudden weakening of one of the muscles of the heart. It is sometimes brought on by emotional strain, such as the death of your beloved, and is usually fatal. This means that it is quite possible to die of a broken heart.However, doctors don't usually call it broken-heart syndrome. They call it takotsubo, which is Japanese for octopus trap. That may sound a trifle odd, but when you're broken hearted your left ventricle swells up until it's just the same shape as a traditional Japanese octopus trap. Like this:The poor (but delicious) octopuses find the pot and think it would make a nice home, so they crawl inside and, once snug, the wily fisherman pulls it up to the surface, cooks his tenant and leaves the other octopuses broken-hearted.They usually die."},

It's played in an enclosed court and is nowadays usually referred to as Real Tennis.The game that they are playing at Wimbledon was invented by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield* in 1873, and he named his new sport Sphairistike, which is Ancient Greek for ball skill (sphere-tech).The only reason that it isn't called the Wimbledon Sphairistike Championship is that nobody had the faintest idea how to pronounce sphairistike, and so they quickly gave up and started referring to it as Lawn Tennis.Sphairistike is easy to pronounce, though. It rhymes with sticky.So go forth, dear reader, and every time somebody mentions the tennis, tut and shake your head.No, of sphairistike.*Londoners can see his blue plaque just round the corner from Pimlico Tube Station.N.B.

Here's the context:As we walked up Mr. Cambridge's meadows towards Twickenham, he [Coleridge] criticized Johnson and Gray as poets, and did not seem to allow them high merit. [That's Gray who wrote Gray's Elegy in a Country Churchyard] The excellence of verse, he said, was to be untranslatable into any other words without detriment to the beauty of the passage; — the position of a single word could not be altered in Milton without injury. Gray's personifications, he said, were mere printer's devils' personifications — persons with a capital letter, abstract qualities with a small one. He thought Collins had more genius than Gray, who was a singular instance of a man of taste, poetic feeling, and fancy, without imagination. He contrasted Dryden's opening of the 10th satire of Juvenal with Johnson's: - \"'Let observation, with extensive view,Survey mankind from Ganges to Peru.'which was as much as to say, - \"'Let observation with extensive observation observe mankind.'\"After dinner he told us a humorous story of his enthusiastic fondness forQuakerism, when he was at Cambridge, and his attending one of theirmeetings, which had entirely cured him. \"And in case you were wondering how Dryden did it, he managed the same couplet in five words:Look round the habitable world, how fewKnow their own good; or knowing it, pursue.How void of reason are our hopes and fears!What in the conduct of our life appearsSo well design'd, so luckily begun,But, when we have our wish, we wish undone?But I prefer Johnson's.Observation, you have your task."},
{"title": "Vendetta", "date": "Monday 20 June 2011", "text": "On Saturday evening I let a choir sing some Renaissance madrigals to me. Among them was a song about how Italy was terribly oppressed in the sixteenth century. The country was exhorted to:Grasp, grasp, bold one, the righteous swordTo avenge yourself of a thousand other abuses.Which wouldn't have been at all interesting were it not that they were singing in Italian, so the lines went:Strigni, strign'animosa iusto ferroChe de mill'altre ingiurie fai vendettaWhere vendetta means avenge. It's funny seeing a word like that stripped of its later associations and sitting at home in its native language. It's rather like seeing a school photograph with Hitler in it (see below).Vendetta is merely the Italian word for vengeance and comes from the same root as vengeance: vindicare. An odd little aspect of vindicare is that it gave us too words - one virtuous and one vicious - vindicated and vindictive.If you are vindictive you are nasty and always seeking vengeance, but if you get your revenge you are vindicated and In The Right. This is approximately the same principle as John Harington's rhyme:Treason doth never prosper, What’s the reason?Why, if it prosper, none dare call it Treason.The vendetta was originally a custom of the Corsicans who so enjoyed the practice that between 1821 and 1852 they shot, stabbed and strangled more than 4,300 people. Luckily there is a word in the OED for what they were. They were keen vendettists.YepP.S.Two violent chefs of ValettaBegan on a bloody vendetta Several hundred were killed Braised, broiled and grilledWhen one dishonoured the other's bruschetta."},
{"title": "Isaac Watts", "date": "Sunday 19 June 2011", "text": "I took a necropolitan stroll yesterday through Abney Park, which is a jumbled and bramble-covered cemetery in North London. One might easily deduce from the chaotic state of the grave stones that the Second Coming had happened years ago. Everything is overgrown with brambles and ivy, and the whole thing is like Ozymandias run riot in Stoke Newington.Hidden right in the middle is a monolithic monument to Isaac Watts, whose writings, dear reader, you are familiar with.What's that? You've never read any Isaac Watts? Well, you have. Sort of.Do you remember the poem in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland that goes:How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail, And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale! How cheerfully he seems to grin, How neatly spreads his claws, And welcomes little fishes in With gently smiling jaws!You do? Do you remember how it is introduced? Alice says:I'll try and say 'How doth the little - ',\" and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come out the same as they used to do...The lesson that Alice is trying to recite was Against Idleness and Mischief. It's a moral poem by Isaac Watts, who was an eighteenth century moralising poet, theologian and hymn-scribbler. The original starts like this:How doth the little busy bee Improve each shining hour And gather honey all the day From every opening flower! How skillfully she builds her cell! How neat she spreads the wax! And labours hard to store it well With the sweet food she makes. And then it goes on to be the origin of another terribly well known phrase:In works of labour or of skill, I would be busy too; For Satan finds some mischief still For idle hands to do. In books, or work, or healthful play, Let my first years be passed, That I may give for every day Some good account at last.So that's two bits of the same poem that you sort of know, isn't it? Did your mother ever tell you that birds in their little nests agree? Mine did. That's another of Isaac's. The full verse goes like this:Birds in their little nests agree;And 'tis a shameful sight,When children of one familyFall out, and chide, and fight.Mind you, you can also kill two birds with one stone, which is how I dealt with my siblings. My old physics teacher told me that time always was always marked on the X axis of a graph because:Time, like an ever-rolling stream,Bears all its sons away;They fly forgotten, as a dreamDies at the opening day. As you can probably tell, Isaac Watts combined tediousness with talent in roughly equal helpings. So I am complimenting him when I say that he was pretty damned tedious. Victorian children were forced to learn and recite all his awful moralisings. However, his poetry can be turned on its head. For example, he wrote a thoroughly condemnatory poem called The Sluggard that begins:'Tis the voice of the sluggard; I heard him complain,\"You have waked me too soon, I must slumber again.\"As the door on its hinges, so he on his bed,Turns his sides and his shoulders and his heavy head.Which I think I shall print out and pin to the door of my bedroom. Later in the poem we are told of the Sluggard's garden:I pass'd by his garden, and saw the wild brier,The thorn and the thistle grow broader and higher;Which would be a perfect description of Abney Park, in which his memorial now stands among grandiose brambles."},

{"title": "The Tittle in the Title", "date": "Thursday 16 June 2011", "text": "During the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus, who seems to have liked obscure words, said:For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.Raising the question, what in the name of all that's holy is a jot or a tittle?The Hebrew law to which Jesus was referring was written down, and Jesus is talking about handwriting. The gospels were written in Greek and the smallest letter in the Greek alphabet was ι. This ι was the equivalent of our i and was called iota. That's why the Vice President of FIFA recently said that he was guilty of:Not a single iota of wrongdoing.Meaning not even the smallest amount. I believe him.Jesus' jot is referring to exactly the same thing: a very small thing indeed. But English has the advantage of Greek. We go smaller than ι.What's the difference between the Greek ι and the English i? The tittle on the top. Tittle has nothing to do with titillate (which comes from titillationem meaning tickling) or with tit (which is a variant of teat). The tittle is the little dot over an i or a j and, because it's up at the top of the letter like a title, it comes from the same Latin route: titulus. Oddly, the Romans didn't call it a titulus. They called it an apex. The Greeks called it a keraia and the Hebrews called it a qots, which meant thorn. So the title of this post contains three tittles, but none of them, unfortunately, are as beautiful as the tittles on the London Underground. The Tube has its own special typeface called Johnston in which the tittles are diamonds. They're beautiful, and not one of them shall pass away until the ends of all eternity, or until the Tube runs smoothly, whichever happens first.A good Christian font"},

You see, the Greek for mosquito was konops. Guess the word yet?The Greek for a couch with a mosquito net around it was konopeion?

This plays havoc with my prose as bathycolpian is corrected to Bathe impish and malbolge comes out as Map Olga. There's a whole website called Damn You, Autocorrect that is devoted to such amusing alterations. However, it doesn't always get it wrong.On Saturday I was in Clerkenwell, which is a bit of London mentioned by T.S. Eliot:Driven on the wind that sweeps the gloomy hills of London,Hampstead and Clerkenwell, Campden and Putney,Highgate, Primrose and Ludgate. And I tried to send a text message saying where I was. But Autocorrect was having none of it. Clerkenwell was, according to Autocorrect, Clerks Well. And the odd thing is that that is absolutely right.Thomas á Beckett had a subdeacon called William Fitzstephen who wrote a brief description of the City of London in 1174 praising \"the respectability of its citizens, and the propriety of their wives\". He also describes how:There are also in the northern suburbs of London springs of high quality, with water that is sweet, wholesome, clear, and \"whose runnels ripple amid pebbles bright\". Among which Holywell, Clerkenwell and St. Clement's Well have a particular reputation; they receive throngs of visitors and are especially frequented by students and young men of the city, who head out on summer evenings to take the country air.The description was written in Latin, but the old English for students was clerken, from which we get the modern English clerk (and clerical). So the well where students hung around on summer evenings was the clerks' well, or Clerkenwell.But Autocorrect knew that already.The well, incidentally is still there, now contained within an office block called Well Court (pictured). And while we're on the subject of clerks, here's an interesting little detail about a poem by Auden.Auden once wrote a poem called The Fall of Rome about the end of a civilisation that is, nominally, ancient Rome. However, there are all sorts of modern details (like trains and musclebound marines) that suggest he was thinking about a more modern civilisation. But which?Auden was an Englishman who had emigrated to America so he knew that in Britain we pronounce clerk to rhyme with ark, but in America clerk rhymes with Turk. So the fifth stanza of this poem shows exactly which civilisation he's thinking about.The piers are pummelled by the waves;In a lonely field the rainLashes an abandoned train;Outlaws fill the mountain caves.Fantastic grow the evening gowns;Agents of the Fisc pursueAbsconding tax-defaulters throughThe sewers of provincial towns.Private rites of magic sendThe temple prostitutes to sleep;All the literati keepAn imaginary friend.Cerebrotonic Cato mayExtol the Ancient Disciplines,But the muscle-bound MarinesMutiny for food and pay.Caesar's double-bed is warmAs an unimportant clerkWrites I DO NOT LIKE MY WORKOn a pink official form.Unendowed with wealth or pity,Little birds with scarlet legs,Sitting on their speckled eggs,Eye each flu-infected city.Altogether elsewhere, vastHerds of reindeer move acrossMiles and miles of golden moss,Silently and very fast.God, I love that last stanza. Incidentally, cerebrotonic means:Designating or characteristic of a type of personality which is introverted, intellectual, and emotionally restrained, classified by Sheldon as being associated with an ectomorphic.Clerkenwell Gaol (or maybe Jail)"},

Browse once meant a bud or leaf and so browsing is eating little bits of vegetation. In fact, the OED rather sternly points out that browsing and grazing are quite different things. Grazing is grassing and browsing is eating browse - leaves and buds and the like - which animals only usually do when there's no grass left.The first recorded humans to browse were in Shakespeare and the browse that they browsed was cold meat. Nobody browsed a book until the nineteenth century, and the idea of going into a shop and just browsing the buds of commerce rather than buying anything is a purely twentieth century notion. And only twenty years ago did people start to browse the Internet.It's rather appropriate, really. If there were grass in the real world we would graze; but for lack of proper pasture one ends up clicking on links, reading blogs and metaphorically and etymologically chewing at the sparse vegetation that grows in the central reservation of the Information Super-Highway.I would say that it was impossible to use a browser to surf, but then I found this picture.

{"title": "Error, Milton, Coleridge and the Opiate of Influence", "date": "Wednesday 8 June 2011", "text": "On the contrary, it means a wandering.Once upon a time there was a happy little Latin word errare, which meant to wander. That is why a wandering knight is a knight errant, and also why a knight errant is necessarily erratic. Indeed, he is an aberration, so long as he is wandering away from something, which he couldn't reasonably help doing, I suppose. A knight errant is therefore also erroneous, he errs, he is in error.That's why, back in the seventeenth century, Milton could write in the fourth book of Paradise Lost that streams flowed through the garden of Eden:With mazy error, under pendant shadesBy an extraordinary coincidence Coleridge used mazy to describe the flow of a stream through a garden in Kubla Khan:Five miles meandering with a mazy motionFunny that. Not that there's much more connection. I mean, it's true that both poems have a river flowing through a garden and that both rivers flow underground:Southward through Eden flowed a river largeNor changed its course, but through the shaggy hillPassed underneath engulfedandThence united fellDown the steep glade, and met the nether flood,Which from his darksome passage now appearsWhile Coleridge has:Where Alph the sacred river ranThrough caverns measureless to manDown to a sunless sea.But there isn't much more in common between the \"fertile ground\" of Milton's Garden of Eden and the \"fertile ground\" of Coleridge's poem. I mean, Milton's garden hasGroves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balmsWhile Coleridge's is a place where:Blossomed many an incence-bearing treeWhich is a completely different wording. Nor could Coleridge's Abyssinian maid . . . Singing of Mount Abora have much to do with Milton'sNor where Abyssin Kings their issue Guard,Mount Amara, Could it? And as for the bit in Milton where a moonlit demon comes across:...a steep wilderness, whose hairy sidesWith thicket overgrown, grotesque and wild,Access denied; and overhead up grewInsuperable height of loftiest shade,Cedar. . .That couldn't have anything to do withBut oh! that deep romantic chasm which slantedDown the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!A savage place! as holy and enchanted As e'er beneath a waning moon was hauntedBy woman wailing for her demon lover.Kubla Khan is often described as a pure vision that sprang from Coleridge's unconscious. It's not. Most of the imagery, right down to the ancestral voices, comes from Book 4 of Paradise Lost. This is rather important from a critical point of view.Where is Mount Abora and what does it represent? Is a less perplexing question when you realise that it's just a misspelling of Mount Amara. Are the river and the chasm Freudian symbols of semen and vagina springing from Coleridge's sex-starved psyche? Well, I admit that Coleridge was a bit screwy on the subject of sex, but the images come from Milton, not from his dreams.What does it mean to have drunk the milk of Paradise? It means you've read Paradise Lost.P.S. There's a slight controversy over where errant comes from, which I have ignored.P.P.S. Full text of Kubla Khan here. Read it!"},
{"title": "The Kubla Khan Crescendo", "date": "Tuesday 7 June 2011", "text": "Yesterday, I wrote a rather puerile parody of the last section of Kubla Khan. The original contains one of the greatest crescendos in English poetry, which is all down to meter. It goes like this:A damsel with a dulcimerIn a vision once I saw:It was an Abyssinian maid,And on her dulcimer she played,Singing of Mount Abora.Could I revive within meHer symphony and song,To such a deep delight 'twould win me,That with music loud and long,I would build that dome in air,That sunny dome! those caves of ice!And all who heard should see them there,And all should cry, Beware! Beware!His flashing eyes, his floating hair!Weave a circle round him thrice,And close your eyes with holy dread,For he on honeydew hath fed,And drunk the milk of Paradise.The crescendo to which I refer is in the linesCould I revive within meHer symphony and song,To such a deep delight 'twould win me,That with music loud and long,The trick is in the trimeter.Most of Kubla Khan is in tetrameters, that there are four beats to each line. te-TUM te-TUM te-TUM te-TUMA damsel with a dulcimerIn a vision once I sawIt was an Abysinnian maidAnd on her dulcimer she playedSinging of Mount Abora.But then Coleridge very cleverly drops down to the trimeter. He starts by merely missing off that last stressed syllable:Could I revive within me,'Ooh,' feels the reader, 'There's something missing here.' And then Coleridge cuts off the last unstressed syllable.Her symphony and song.We're down to three beats and only six syllables. We are noticeably short. And the reader, whether or not he can explain why, feels a frustration and a desire to break back into the proper rhythm. It is all much too short, too compressed, too stuffy and claustrophobic. Will we never be set free? Will the line never get its last syllable back? Yes, it will. Ready for the release? Here goes!To such a deep delight 'twould win me,Not only do you get back to the four-beat tetrameter, but you have beautiful release of a whole extra unstressed syllable. The dam has been broken, the torrent is flowing freely again. The compression was necessarily followed by an explosion, and the famine by a feast.That with music loud and long...Now, we're back to the tetrameter, and perhaps something should be said about the meaning of the words rather than just the rhythm. The change in meter has not happened alone. For starters it's been bound into one sentence. This means that the reader can't think to himself that the differing line-lengths signify different sections of the poem. This is reinforced by the fact that the rhyme scheme runs straight over the metrical variation. Moreover, the two trimeter lines have been part of one conditional clause. And here's the beautiful thing: in terms of meaning he's talking about what he'd like to do and can't (revive within me), in terms of grammar he's talking about a hypothetical condition that can't be fulfilled, and in terms of meter he's nearly getting to the end of the tetrameter, but no quite.Then he gets into a hypothetical success, a subjunctive reality and a metrical release.All at once.Clever, isn't it?And the lovely thing is that, though not everybody can write Kubla Khan, the metrical trick is infinitely reusable.

{"title": "Bathycolpian", "date": "Monday 6 June 2011", "text": "There is a damned fine reasonfor this picture.A bathometer is, so saith the OED:A spring balance of peculiar construction for ascertaining the depth of water without actually measuring the sounding line.And can therefore be used to measure the depth of your bath. The odd thing about this is that there is No Connection Between The Words. Bathometer comes from the Greek bathos (meaning depth), and bath comes from the Old English baeth (meaning bathe).Bathos has made a good little career in the English language. Alexander Pope used it to mean the art of sinking in poetry. I've already written a blog post on bathypelagic. But I have never mentioned (and I very much doubt that you already know) the beautiful and buxom word bathycolpian.Bathycolpian means deep-bosomed is an absurdly oblique and beautiful way of saying that a lady has voluptuous and luxuriant boobies.The advantages of describing a lady in such an incomprehensible manner will be evident to anyone who has ever been slapped or released on strict parole. As Samuel Taylor Coleridge didn't put it:A damsel with enormous breastsIn a movie once I saw:It was a bathycolpian maid,Who in the Trevi Fountain played,Each bosom like Mount Abora.Could I revive within meThose mammaries so proud,To such a deep delight 'twould win meThat with music long and loud,I would build those domes in air,Those happy domes! so round and nice!And all who heard should see them thereAnd all should cry, Beware! Beware!His flashing eyes, his flowing hair!Weave a circle round him thrice,It is too late to intervene,For he Fellini's films hath seen,And drunk the milk of Paradise.(With apologies to Mr Coleridge)"},

You have the aspect of one whom Fate has smitten in the spiritual solar plexus, or of one who has been searching for the leak in Life's gaspipe with a lighted candle. What's wrong?'And it made me wonder why the solar plexus is solar, and indeed what a plexus is, and furthemoreover why I don't hear the term any more.The answer to the first two of these questions is that the solar plexus is a complex of nerves that sits in the middle of the body just as Sol sits in the middle of the solar system. The plex of plexus is the same plex that you find in complex or indeed perplex and comes straight from the Latin for braid: plectere.This also means that if you encircle something with braids you complicate it. The reason that you don't hear it much any more is that it is now called the coeliac (bowel) plexus, which is much less fun.

{"title": "How to Write to a Literary Agent", "date": "Friday 3 June 2011", "text": "So you write a novel and send it off to your agent, let's call him Mr Pinker. Mr Pinker shows it to a publisher - Duckworth for example - and writes back to you saying that they didn't like it, but he accidentally includes the reader's report in with the letter. You don't know how to respond to his mistake and it's terribly awkward.Unless of course you're James Joyce, the novel is Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and you have Ezra Pound dealing with the agent on your behalf. Then you're fine and dandy. Because Ezra Pound writes letters like this:Dear Mr Pinker,   I have read the effusion of Mr Duckworth's reader with not inconsiderable disgust. These vermin crawl over and beslime our literature with their pulings, and nothing but the day of judgement can, I suppose, exterminate 'em. Thank god one need not, under ordinary circumstances, touch them. Hark to his puling squeak: too 'unconventional'. What in hell do we want but some change from the unbearable monotony of the weekly six shilling pears soap annual novel; ... the dungminded dungbearded, penny a line, please-the-mediocre-at-all-cost doctrine. You English will get no prose till you enterminate this breed ...Canting, supercilious, blockhead... I always supposed from report that Duckworth was an educated man, but I can not reconcile this opinion with his retention of the author of the missive you send me. If you have to spend your life in contact with such minds, God help you ...Why can't you send the publisher's reader to the serbian front, and get some good out of the war...Serious writes will certainly give up the use of english altogether unless you can improve the process of publication.In conclusion, you have given me a very unpleasant quarter of an hour, my disgust flows over, though I suppose there is no use in spreading it over this paper. If there is any phrase or form of contempt that you care to convey from me to the reeking Malebolge of the Duckworthian slum, pray, consider yourself at liberty to draw on my account (unlimited credit) and transmit it.Please, if you have occasion to write again either in regard to this book or any other, please do not enclose the publisher's readers opinions. Sincerely yours,EZRA POUNDP.S.  ...  as for altering Joyce to suit Duckworth's readers - I would like trying to fit the Venus de Milo into a piss-pot ....Since you ask, enterminate isn't a word, but Malebolge is.

{"title": "Worrywart", "date": "Thursday 2 June 2011", "text": "I have just this second been sent an e-mail containing a word I'd never hear before: worrywart. Isn't that a lovely word? It means exactly what you'd think it means: somebody who frets too much*. It's beautifully alliterative and the OED says that it's been around since 1956, and I've just found it in a magazine from 1937. So far as I can tell, the only reason that I've never heard of worry-wart before is that it's an Americanism, but such a beautiful one.I was told last night that worriers live longer. I'm such a carefree and debonair sort of fellow that this threw me into a panic.Worry, by the way, originally meant to strangle, but its meaning has slowly weakened over the years until throttling has become a mere irritant. Mind you, my tie still worries me.Which reminds me of a concrete poem by Guillaume Appolonaire. The idea of a concrete poem is simply that you write it in the shape of the subject. The following translates approximately as: The painful tie that you wear so smartly, take it off, civilised one, if you want to breathe easily.*And I don't mean a guitarist, although guitars are highly strung."},
{"title": "Kinetic Cinema", "date": "Wednesday 1 June 2011", "text": "The other day, a chap asked me where cinema came from, and I had no idea. So I dashed home and looked it up. First, I found that it is not, of course, cinema, but cinematograph, which means moving picture, or more precisely it means kinetic picture, because it's exactly the same Greek root, kinemat, which meant movement.This means that cinema and movie (or cinmatograph and moving picture) are exactly the same thing, except that one is Latin (via movere) and the other is Greek.However, as the images don't actually move, but only appear to, a stickler for facts should really go to the pictures.The other word that comes from kinema is cite, because if you bring a fact into your argument (something that I never do as I abhor facts and prefer my opinions) you cite it.Now, run!"},
{"title": "Nothing Compares...", "date": "Tuesday 31 May 2011", "text": "Yesterday, I heard Nothing Compares 2U playing on the radio and I was reminded of how bloody fantastic the first line is.I've mentioned before that I think first lines are overrated things, but they have a job; indeed they have a couple of jobs. There are two things that a first line should do. First: it should establish something important. The sky was blue and the grass was green is a bad first line because it could be prefixed to almost any story without adding anything (unless your hero is colour-blind). The other thing that a first line should do is throw the reader off slightly. Only slightly. There's always a danger that a chap will settle down to appreciate your book, and books should not be appreciated, they should be experienced. You don't want your reader to appreciate that your joke is funny, you want him to laugh. You don't want your reader to appreciate your plot-twists, you want him to be startled. This problem is horribly acute when the reader picks up the book for the first time, because of course he is probably going to use his judgement of your first line to decide whether to continue. So you need to, as it were, pull his seat of judgement out from under him.But here's the paradox: if you do that too obviously, the reader is likely to say 'Oh! How wonderfully unexpected! He's pulled my seat of judgement out from under me in a very clever way.'This is a failure. So you must be cunning. You need to be subtle. That's why Call me Ishmael is the best first line in history. On the surface, nothing has happened. The main character is called Ishmael. Onwards to the second sentence. But he's not named in a normal way. The first line is not My name is Ishmael. It's Call me Ishmael. Most readers don't notice that the narrator of Moby Dick is anonymous. Instead, a sort of ad hoc deal is set up between narrator and reader that Ishmael is the name we shall use, but that for all we know he's really called Brian.And the vital thing is that that ad hoc deal is set up just quickly enough and just subtly enough that the reader barely notices. He's on the second sentence, but somewhere at the back of his mind there's that nagging feeling that something is wrong.The same thing goes with It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. Right ho! On to the second sentence, barely wondering whether this is a statement of truth (It is a truth universally acknowledged, that the sun rises in the East) or of satire (It is a truth universally acknowledged, that if a girl doesn't have a Gucci handbag she might as well be dead). Is this the omniscient or sarcastic narrator? Does Jane believe this, or is she laughing at those who do?Subtle. The reader barely notices, but they are that much less able to stand in dissociated judgement.Which brings me around to the song by Prince, first recorded by The Family, and made famous by Sinead O'Connor. It's not on a level with Melville or Austen, but it's damn close.It's been seven hours and fifteen daysSince you took your love away.All Prince did was to reverse the usual order of weights and measures. Most people start with the largest - three pounds and fifty pence, eleven stone and six ounces, fifteen days and seven hours.It's hardly a dramatic shift. Seven hours and fifteen days is quite comprehensible, you might not notice. But it's enough to tip you off balance so subtly that you don't even notice your fall. Moreover - and this is the beauty of it - it establishes the character. After the first two lines the rest of the song is barely necessary. It's somebody who split up with his girlfriend* more than a fortnight ago, but is still counting their separation in hours. That's why they're listed first. That's all you need to know about the poor fellow: lovelorn enough that his measurements are reversed. And the real beauty is that the listener might never notice that all that information has been conveyed in the first seven words.It's enough to make you forgive the 2U instead of To You.Almost enough.*Working from the original version."},

A pilgarlic is an ancient and derogatory term for a bald man. It was invented by John Skelton who once wrote:Your peeled-garlic headCould occupy there no stead.And has been used off and on ever since. As late as 1978 the Oxford Times wrote:BBC 1 offers those pilgarlic gentlemen Yul Brynner (in an adventure movie) and Telly Savalas (as Kojak).But despite the continued absenteeism of hair, the word has fallen, unjustly into disuse.

{"title": "Morris Dancing and Othello", "date": "Friday 27 May 2011", "text": "Pausing on Lamb's Conduit Street yestereve I saw a troop of Morris dancers waving their sticks about. For those of you who have never seen or heard of morris dancing, it's the most traditional olde-worlde, merrie-Englande form of folk dancing. Except it's not English. It's Arab.Morris is a corruption of Moorish (via Morisk). Moorish is of or pertaining to the Moors and Moor is an old word for an Arab.Well, in fact, Moor used to be used indiscriminately to mean Arab, negro, Indian, Muslim or pretty much anything that originated from beyond Kent. That's why nobody, to this day, is quite sure whether Othello, the Moor of Venice, was meant to be black (as we would understand the term) or Arab.The dance that I witnessed yesterday has been called a Morisk, Moresque, Moorish or Morris dance since the fifteenth century. So I assume that it was Othello's favourite jig.Moor itself comes from Mauritania which was the ancient name for Morocco, although, weirdly Morocco doesn't have anything to do with Moor. Nor does Moorish, meaning Arabian, have anything to do with More-ish meaning appetite-whetting, a fact that was lost on the writers of a wine list in a restaurant I once visited. Here is a rather blurry photo:A Scotsman once told Arnold Bax that \"You should make a point of trying every experience once, except incest and folk-dancing.\" This phrase is usually now repeated with the folk replaced by Morris. But poor Desdemona would tell you that you should also strike from the list a dangerously Moorish husband.The hankerchiefs were all stolen from Desdemona"},
{"title": "Fits and Starts and Leaps and Bounds", "date": "Thursday 26 May 2011", "text": "An American* chap called Barack Obama gave a speech yesterday in which he lyrically waxed upon the origins of things like liberty and the rule of law, but not upon the origins of phrases. It was his analysis of developing economies that caught my ear: And that is why countries like China, India and Brazil are growing so rapidly -- because in fits and starts, they are moving towards the market-based principles that the United States and the United Kingdom have always embraced.Because:Countries like China, India, and Brazil are growing by leaps and bounds.Fits and starts and leaps and bounds! What strenuous movements!Fits and starts goes back to a sermon of 1620 by a chap called Robert Sanderson who compares Christian virtue to actually having a fit thusly:A man of a cold complexion hath as much heat in a sharp fit of an ague, as he that is of a hot constitution, and in health, and more too; his blood is more inflamed, and he burneth more. But whether do you think is the more kindly heat, that which cometh from the violence of a fever, or that which ariseth from the condition of a man's temper? . . . Then for constancy and lasting,—if the heat come by fits, and starts, and paroxysms, leaping eftsoons and suddenly out of one extreme into another, so as the party one while gloweth as hot as fire, another while is chill and cold as ice, and keepeth not at any certain stay, that is an ill sign too, and it is to be feared there is an ague either bred, or in breeding...Personally, I do everything by fits and starts, except for having a fit, which I do constantly. I live in a semi-permanent fit of poetic inspiration, which is no good, because as Nicolas Boileau pointed out in his L'Art Poetique: A Poem, where we all Perfections find, Is not the work of a fantastick [crazy] Mind:There must be Care, and Time, and Skill and Pains;Nor the first heat of unexperienced Brains.Yet sometimes artless Poets, when the rageOf a warm Fancy does their Minds engage,Puff'd with the vain Pride, presume they understand,And boldly take the Trumpet in their hand;Their fustian Muse each Accident confounds;Nor can she fly, but rise by leaps and bounds,'Till their small stock of Learning quickly spent,Their poem dies for want of Nourishment.Well, obviously that's not what Boileau wrote. He was French, poor chap. But luckily for him John Dryden and Sir William Soames produced that translation in 1694. Which one of them actually wrote the words leaps and bounds is unknown, but I like to think it was Soames as I can't find anything else about him.Nicolas Boileau's Art of Poetry, even in the Dryden and Soames translation, isn't a classic. Sensible: yes. Famous: no. Voltaire liked it and so did Dr Johnson. But in Dr Johnson's opinion it was nothing as compared to Pope's translation of the Iliad which was (apparently): \"a performance which no age or nation could hope to equal\". That's absolute hogwash. Chapman's Homer is much better, but we'll let that pass. I've written about Iliad translations before and the only reason I mentioned Pope's was that he uses the phrase leaps and bounds twice: first in the introduction where he says of those who would translate Homer: Methinks I see these different followers of Homer, some sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the certain signs of false mettle), others slowly and servilely creeping in his train, while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal majesty before them.And then in Book 21 when a river is trying to drown Achilles (and no: that shouldn't be passive):High o'er the surging tide, by leaps and bounds,He wades, and mounts; the parted wave resounds.Not a whole river stops the hero's course,While Pallas fills him with immortal force.It is Pope's poem that, I suspect, made the phrase famous and slyly inserted into the language. As this blog proved a year ago, Pope is the most quoted English poet by quite some way, even if he is scandalously underread in these seedy times. So Obama's speech about the basis of democracy is itself based upon John Dryden, Alexander Pope and God.*Although I have compelling evidence he was actually born in Tring."},
{"title": "A Dildo For A Song", "date": "Wednesday 25 May 2011", "text": "Last night I went to see All's Well That Ends Well at the Globe. A line in the play made me think of the Beatles and Our Mutual Friend. Clown: By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy man.Countess: By what observance, I pray you?Clown: Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.What is the connection to the Beatles? Well, it's an obscure aspect of the song Your Mother Should Know (video beneath), the lyrics of which run:Let's all get up and dance to a songThat was a hit before your mother was bornAnd though she was born a long, long time ago,Your mother should know,Your mother should know.You see, Paul McCartney's mother was born in 1909, which means that the song was probably a hit in 1908 or earlier, in which case its hittiness would not have been measured in record sales, but in sales of sheet music. Do you remember Silas Wegg in Our Mutual Friend? No? Oh well. He's a poor street vendor who develops a rather weird obsession with the occupants of the house outside of which he sells ballads and sheet music.Sheet music used to be everywhere. Before the gramophone existed it was the only way of obtaining a song for keeps. Hearing a song was no more than hearing a recitation of a poem. If you liked it, you bought it on paper. So selling music was an essential part of everyday life, and the salesmen were (often) the lowest of the low. The same character, essentially, pops up in A Winter's Tale. Autolycus, who describes himself as \"a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles\", is an itinerant ballad-seller who:...hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; nomilliner can so fit his customers with gloves: hehas the prettiest love-songs for maids; so withoutbawdry, which is strange; with such delicateburthens of dildos and fadings...I fear an aside on dildoes is required. The word is first recorded in 1598 meaning exactly what it does today, but it also appeared in lots of ballads as a meaningless refrain. Just as our songs have sha-la-las and yeah-yeah-yeahs, so Elizabethan ballads had fa-la-las, hey-nonny-noes, and dildoes. All of which brings us full circle to that line from All's Well That Ends Well which is the very first recorded example of selling something for a song. When the melancholy man of whom the clown speaks sold a goodly manor for a song, he was exchanging his real estate for a piece of sheet music because he needed something new to sing.Perhaps, for the price of his land he got hold of the Roxburghe Ballads, which contain the beautiful lines:She prov'd herself a Duke's daughter, and he but a Squire's son. Sing trang dildo leeNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to sing trang dildo lee all over London until I get arrested."},

I had no idea. Moreover, the powerful spirits of the neolithic gods were interfering with my iPhone so I couldn't find out instantly. A Swedish chap suggested that henge meant stone, which would have made Stonehenge mean stonestone. This would have been fun, but was not true.Henge relates to hang and to hinge. A hinge is the centre upon which the everything else hangs. A henge-cliff is an overhanging rock and so Stonehenge is the Hanging-Stones. This may be because the horizontal stones hang upon the others, or because the monument could usefully double as a gallows. Stonehenge has only been called by that name since the twelfth century, before that it was known as the Giant's Dance.

{"title": "Irriguous Poetry", "date": "Wednesday 18 May 2011", "text": "Much of the time this blog is merely an excuse to quote poetry. It's like a money laundering joint, with etymology at the front and stacks of used verses in the back room. So today's word is irriguous which means moistened, and comes from the same root as irrigated. I came across the irriguous in an obscure eighteenth century poem by a chap called Lord Dreghorn who was hopelessly in love with his housemaid.He writes so sweetly of how she won't have sex with him even for money, of how she's hit him with a broom, a mop and a frying pan, of how he spies on her when she's bathing, and of how love has made him loathe his greenhouse.Lord Dreghorn is also very good with his compound adjectives: tub-enclosed, coal-fraught, turf-kindled, heiress-married, art-created and fortune-hunting.In fact, I shall copy out the whole thing, just for you, dear reader, just for you.Nor Hammond's love, nor Shenstone's was sincere, For, they, though poor, to high-born maids laid claim; A handsome house-maid causes my despair,And Nelly, not Neaera, is her name. What though devoid of all coquettish care,Bare-footed she, except on Sundays, goes, To wash her hands forgets, and comb her hair, Nor with her fingers scorns to blow her nose?On ev'ry feature and on ev'ry limb,Beauty and strength have lavished all their care; A food too rich is skim-milk cheese for him That would with her the city-flirt compare. In vain, to win her, proffered oft have IThe gaudy ribbon, and the curious lace,In vain displayed, to her relentless eyeThe guinea's seldom unsuccessful face.Repulsed, I often have indignant sworn;Some freedoms often struggled hard to force; But soon, too soon, severely checked forbore, She more enraged, and my reception worse.The brimful milking-pail, the empty can, Th' unwieldy besom, big with prickly fate; The nauseous mop, and hissing frying-pan,Have fall'n, vindictive, on my guardless pate. Yet I, infatuate! pursue her still;Happy to lurk, insidious, and unseen, Among the willows, nurslings of the rill, That winds irriguous, through the washing-green;For there, with forcible alternate tread,From the soaked linen ev'ry stain to press, The tub-enclosed, and unsuspecting maid, Furls, unashamed, th' impediments of dress.This scene augments my ardour to proceed,Nor from the heart her cruelty to me; Nay, she acknowledged once it did proceed, Not from dislike, but difference of degree.‘Tis true, for though she spurns my fond address,Yet to her equals is no coyness shown;She, unconstrained, will Tom the gard’ner kiss,Toy, romp and wanton with the ploughman John.Heav’n knows, for thee, sole mistress of my heart!I to the meanest station would descend,Drive whistling cheerfully the coal-fraught cart,Or buttered milk from unscoured barrels vend.With scanty wages and with weekly meal,A thatch-roofed cottage and turf-kindled fire,Content and happy, I through life would steal,Nor envy once the heiress-married squire.By thee rejected me my fields no more,No more, my art-created gardens please;I loathe my greenhouse, so admired before,And undelighted wander through my trees.Since I in grief must pine my youth away,If disappointed of this virtuous maid,How weak, how foolish, is it to delay,The low, but lovely villager to wed.What would my parents, what my kindred say?What defamation would I undergo,At rout, ball, concert, opera and play,The jest of ev’ry fortune-hunting beau!No four-wheel chaise, of nice new-fashioned shape,Would ever stop at my dishonoured house;No well-dressed footman, with tremendous rap,Announce a visit to my humble spouse.Fond youth, t’indulge the mean idea cease,A flame disgraceful to extinguish strive,And bear resigned, when, of the jolly piece,A country-wedding shall they hopes deprive.The besom filled with prickly fate is, by the way, a broom (here used by Nell as a weapon). I looked up Lord Dreghorn in the Dictionary of National Biography. I hoped desperately to find that he had married an Eleanor, but no. Two years after that poem was written Lord Dreghorn married a woman called Esther Cunninghame and had ten children.The guinea's seldom unsuccessful face"},

After it is over we return to the village.Other than the betel-nut, that is my method precisely. You may wonder, dear savage reader, why I was reading this and the answer is that I promised you a post on the missionary position and it is from Malinowski's Sexual Life of Savages that the term ultimately derives. However, the term appears to be a Big Mistake and a calumny on poor missionaries. Here are the two relevant passages:Above all, the natives despise the European position and consider it unpractical and improper. The natives, of course, know it because white men frequently cohabit with native women, some even being married to them. But as they say: \"The man overlies heavily the woman; he presses her heavily downwards, she cannot respond (ibilampu).\"Well, each to his own, I suppose. But you may well notice that there is no mention of missionaries in this passage. Nor do they pop up anywhere nearby. I checked. The missionary fashion doesn't appear until a hundred and something pages later and it's not a sexual position. Here's the full passage:Even courting is conducted most decorously. Scenes of frequent occurrence in an public park in Europe, after dark or even before, would never be seen in a Trobriand village. Holding hands, leaning against each other, embracing. . . are not permitted to lovers in public. I observed once or twice that Yobukwa'u and his betrothed used to lie together on a mat in broad daylight decorously leaning against each other and holding hands, in a manner which we would find perfectly natural in a pair of lovers soon to be married. But when I mentioned this in discussing the whole subject with some natives, I was told at once that it was a new fashion and not correct according to old custom. Tokolibeba, once a famous Don Juan, now a peppery old conservative and stickler for proprieties, insisted that this was misinari si bubnela, \"missionary fashion\", one of those novel immoralities introduced by Christianity. He spoke with as much feeling and righteous indignation as the late Rev. C.M. Hyde of Honolulu might have against heathen pruriency.So, you have the awkward European coital posture, and the scandalous European habit of hand-holding. They're described separately and are utterly distinct. Who could possibly confuse the two? Alfred Kinsey, that's who. In a book of 1948 he refers to The Sexual Life of Savages thusly:Malinowski. . . notes that caricatures of the English-American position are performed around the communal campfires, to the great amusement of the natives who refer to the position as the ‘missionary position’.No. Malinowski does not. Not in the slightest. The missionary fashion he describes is holding hands. The sexual position he describes is the European position.By such mistakes is language formed; and those poor missionaries can only weep at the injustice of it all. The Inky Fool's sermon went down rather well.P.S. This post was meant to come out on Friday, but a combination of technical problems and personal faineancy have delayed it until now."},
{"title": "Eliot on Typewriters", "date": "Thursday 12 May 2011", "text": "In August 1916 T.S. Eliot was working as a book reviewer and wrote this in a letter to Conrad Aiken:I have reviewed some good books and much trash. It is good practice in writing and teaches on speed both in reading and writing. It is bad in this way, that one acquires an extraordinary appetite for volumes, and exults at the mass of printed matter which one has devoured and evacuated. . . . Composing on the typewriter, I find that I am sloughing off all my long sentences which I used to dote upon. Short, staccato, like modern French prose. The typewriter makes for lucidity, but I am not sure that it encourages subtlety.I'm always interested in how external, physical circumstance affects writing. Oddly, I think the reverse would be true of me. I type much faster that I can write and this leads to a voluptuous superfluity of words. Were I to take up my old fountain pen, I would probably become much more stern and efficient.Eliot's words are more appropriate to the lapidary style of my text messages, of which I have already written here.And here, because life needs a spoonful of poetry, is Eliot on the subject of a typistThe typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lightsHer stove, and lays out food in tins.Out of the window perilously spreadHer drying combinations touched by the sun's last rays,On the divan are piled (at night her bed)Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.A peek behind the scenes at Inky Fool"},
{"title": "Ventripotent", "date": "Wednesday 11 May 2011", "text": "You musn't call people fat. They get offended. Call a man tubby and he will bubble with resentment, call a lady plump and she'll give you a slap. Even pleasant sounding words like podgy can get you in trouble. The whole thesaurus - meaty, stout, obese, overweight, chubby, pudgy, fubsy, squat, five by five, square, dumpy, chunky, portly, corpulent, paunchy, pot-bellied, gorbellied, convex, puffy, pursey, bloated, double-chinned, plump as a dumpling, plump as a partridge, fat as a quail, fat as butter, fat as brawn, fat as bacon, fat as a pig - will get you in similar trouble.So what are you to do when you need to describe a fatty-fattener? Inky Fool and a three-hundred year old dictionary have the answer: Ventripotent.Sounds good, doesn't it? Everybody wants to be potent and, unless they know what the ventri is, I suspect they'll take it well. Of course, if they looked in a copy of Cawdrey's Table Alphabeticall (1604) they would find the following:Ventripotent, big-paunch, bellie-able, huge-guts.But as they are very unlikely to have a copy to hand you're safe. Ventri, you see, was the Latin for stomach and potent means, well, potent. It's the same ventri that you find in ventriloquism, which means speaking from the stomach. In fact, ventriloquism was originally the belief that you had a loquacious demon in your belly. Another antique dictionary, Blount's Glossographia, has this:Ventriloquist, one that hath an evil spirit speaking in his belly, or one that by use and practise can speak as it were out of his belly, not moving his lips.The Inky Fool resented being pointed at like that."},
{"title": "Editor", "date": "Tuesday 10 May 2011", "text": "Editor was once a Latin word meaning one who puts forth. That's why the chap or chappess who puts forth a book came to be known as an editor. As the putter-forth of a book usually has to make some alterations we then got our familiar verb edit. As those alterations are usually deletions, edited has come to mean cut.However, it's worthwhile remembering that editor only got attached to books by coincidence. Etymologically, somebody who threw you out of a nightclub or a window could have been called an editor. Moreover, the original Roman editors were much more brutal people.In the high and palmy state of Rome the Editor was the man who put out the games at the Colosseum. He obtained the Christians, the lions, the gladiators and decided, in his pomp, which would live and which die. A couple of descriptions will help:The editor giving the games, usually to curry political favor with the mob, rode behind on a chariot perhaps drawn by exotic wild animals such as zebras or even ostriches. And:If the emperor was not in attendance, the producer (editor) of the games decided the fate of the victim. Even if defeated, a gladiator might be granted a reprieve (missus) if he fought well or, if neither fighter prevailed, both could be reprieved stans missus. But a gladiator also could be forced to fight again the same day, although that was considered bad form, and there were contests in which no reprieve was granted the loser (sine missione). Ask any writer: nothing has changed.The Inky Fool asks whether something should be cut"},
{"title": "The Return of the Mission", "date": "Monday 9 May 2011", "text": "I met a distressed vicar yesterday. The source of his troubles was not guilt or doubt or the approach of the rapture: the terror facing this particular vicar was that this week he has to write a Mission Action Plan.The management jargon shuddered on the preacher's lips like a blasphemy. He had to write down goals and objectives and mission statements and feed forward his blue-sky ideas from outside the box. That's what a Mission Action Plan (or MAP!) is.He asked me whether I would write it for him, assuring me that it would be a work of pure fiction anyway. I refused because I am lazy. But as I wandered away from God and towards the pub, it occurred to me that the word mission has come full circle. The primary meaning of mission, as defined in the OED, is:In Trinitarian theology: the sending into the world of the Son or Spirit by the Father, or of the Spirit by the Son, esp. for the purpose of salvation.This is the sense that the word had in 1530. Mission was a solely religious word for the first hundred years of its existence in English. It's from the Latin misso, meaning send, and is, or was, the exclusive preserve of missionaries. It wasn't until 1626 that Francis Bacon invented the idea of godless, diplomatic mission, and it wasn't until 1910 that anybody had the idea that soldiers might be sent on a mission. The missions impossible and accomplished of soldiers and spies are a twentieth century invention.And shooting people, as everybody knows, is cool and efficient. So it's the military sense of mission that was eventually stolen by business-speak and by management consultants. The modern Director of Regional Sales no longer has a job, he has a mission, just like a soldier, a mission that he must complete at all costs (or, preferably, minimum cost). And guess who appropriated the word mission from the horrid world of management jargon and gibberish? That's right. The Church of England. So mission has come full circle: from theology to diplomacy, to the military, to management-speak and back at last to its true home in the church. It is the prodigal son of the language, sleeping among the swine.Indeed, I think the story of mission has already been described in the Ecclesiastes:The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. And that is, of course, the origin of the phrase nothing new under the sun.I cannot believe that this graph existsP.S. Yes. There will be a post on the missionary position some time later in the week. I may have to do some research in the British Library."},
{"title": "Garnered", "date": "Friday 6 May 2011", "text": "According to the news :Intelligence garnered from waterboarded detainees was used to track down al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and kill himThis is one of those awkward statements that will make any right-thinking person wrestle with the thorny question of where the word garner comes from and what exactly it means.Garner is one of those strange verbs that lives only inside the pages of a newspaper. I don't believe that in my long and intricate life I have ever garnered anything. It's not one of those verbs that you use. 'What are you planning to do this afternoon?''Oh, I'm planning to garner.'Doesn't work, does it? Even if you put in an object for the verb you still end up with:'I was planning to garner some stamps for my collection.'But newspapers get to use garner without an eyelid being batted. This seems unfair, why should journalists keep all the garnering to themselves? It comes, since you ask, from the French word grenier, which meant granary. The R got moved by a process that etymologists call metathesis and so we ended up with the noun garner which also meant granary.Then the noun was changed to a verb. Just as a person can be housed or hospitalized, so grain could be garnered, or put into the garner. To garner is to granary-ize.The metaphorical use of garner was, of bloody course, invented by Shakespeare. In every marriage guidance counsellor's favourite play Othello tells Desdemona that she is the place:...where I have garner'd up my heart,Where either I must live, or bear no life;The fountain from the which my current runs,Or else dries up...And then kills her a few scenes later. Anyway, the OED traces garner as a rather obscure word meaning to store up, as in a granary, until the nineteenth century when it disappears. There's no sense in the dictionary of obtain, as in the news article above.So what the hell happened? Some strange agricultural journalist with a penchant for granarizing facts? Must be, I suppose. And it seems to have happened in about 1980. Here's a graph of the frequency of the use of the word garnered in English.From that graph garner what you can. And remember, it has nothing to do with garnish."},
{"title": "Medioxumate", "date": "Thursday 5 May 2011", "text": "If you are medioxumate it means that you are a god, but only a middling sort of god. You aren't a top god like Allah or Jehovah, but you aren't a godling either. It's a rather useful sort of word for bringing in a qualification when discussing divinity. If you hear somebody described as a sex god, you can agree, but add that they are only a medioxumate one. This won't cause offence: partly because being a medioxumate sex god is better than not being a sex god at all, and partly because nobody in their right mind knows what medioxumate means.The Toothache God of Kathmandu is a proper example of a medioxumate god. He's the chap in the picture and is only usually worshipped when a dentist is unavailable, because as Shakespeare put it: There was never yet philosopher that could endure the toothache patiently."},
{"title": "Dinosaurs and Tennyson", "date": "Wednesday 4 May 2011", "text": "I was shocked to learn recently that brontosauruses never existed. Not only does that mean that the toy of my childhood was mischristened, it also means that there is no creature called a thunder lizard, and I think that's a shame.You see, sauros was just the Greek word for lizard so all those sauruses that we know and love are just something-lizards. Brontes was a cyclops whose name meant The Thunderer so a brontosaurus was a thunder-lizard. A stegosaurus, whose back was covered with armour plating, was a roof-lizard; and a tyrannosaurus was a king-lizard, from the same root as tyrant. Tyrannosaurus rex is funny name. Sophocles' Greek play Oedipus Tyrannos was known in Latin as Oedipus Rex because tyrannos and rex are the same thing: a king. So a tyrannosaurus rex is a king-lizard king.Dinosaur itself comes from the Greek deinos and means frightening-lizard.The reason that brontosauruses never existed is that the species had already been discovered and named. The chap who thought that he'd found a new kind of dinosaur had, in fact, merely found a slight variant on the old apatosaurus. And what does apatosaurus mean? Deceptive-lizard.Oh, the lies of my youth!Anyway, when I think about dinosaurs I always go back to what I believe is the first dinosaur poem. It's a section of In Memoriam by Tennyson probably written in the 1840s. Tennyson has been comforting himself with the thought that though individual humans die, humanity remains. Nature doesn't care about individuals, but looks after species and types. He then remembers that the (reasonably) newly-discovered dinosaurs prove that that is not the case. This results in renewed misery for Tennyson and one of the greatest passages of poetry in English.\"So careful of the type?\" but no. From scarped cliff and quarried stone She cries, \"A thousand types are gone: I care for nothing, all shall go. \"Thou makest thine appeal to me: I bring to life, I bring to death: The spirit does but mean the breath: I know no more.\" And he, shall he, Man, her last work, who seem'd so fair, Such splendid purpose in his eyes, Who roll'd the psalm to wintry skies, Who built him fanes of fruitless prayer, Who trusted God was love indeed And love Creation's final law -- Tho' Nature, red in tooth and claw With ravine, shriek'd against his creed -- Who loved, who suffer'd countless ills, Who battled for the True, the Just, Be blown about the desert dust, Or seal'd within the iron hills? No more? A monster then, a dream, A discord. Dragons of the prime, That tare each other in their slime, Were mellow music match'd with him. O life as futile, then, as frail! O for thy voice to soothe and bless! What hope of answer, or redress? Behind the veil, behind the veil. Tennyson contemplating the brontosaurus"},

{"title": "Nothing to do with ABBA", "date": "Monday 2 May 2011", "text": "A fellow was shot today in Abbottabad. It may have been yesterday. I'm not sure. What I can say for certain is that it is no coincidence that Abbottabad sounds like the English word Abbot, for the town is named after an English general named James Abbott.This brings us to the central mystery of the shooting in Abbottabad: how did the surname Abbott come about. 'Simple!' I hear you cry. 'One of his ancestors must have been an abbot.'Not so simple. The earliest Mr Abbot (Alwoldus Abbas) is recorded in 1111 AD, by which time priests were absolutely and completely banned from getting married and making babies. Of course, they still did have babies, but the babies were illegitimate.Abbot as a surname probably arose not as a description of a profession (like Smith or Baker), but as a nickname, presumably for somebody rather pious and fatherly.For abbot, ultimately means father. It comes from the Latin abbatem, which is the accusative of abbas, which comes from the Greek abbas, which comes from the Aramaic word abba. How did an Aramaic word get into Latin? From Jesus, or more specifically from Mark's Gospel. Jesus would have spoken Aramaic, but the Gospels were written in Greek. Occasionally, though, the evangelists, for some reason, felt it necessary to mention the original word* that Jesus had used. For example:And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.So abba was an Aamaic honorific meaning Father. How Mr Laden felt about living in a place named after a Christian priest and a Jewish father is unknown. I hope that if the special forces were able to get one answer out of him, it would have been that.None of which has anything at all to do with the Swedish pop maestros ABBA, who are named after a Swedish fish-canning company.Since 1838*Well, sort of. The quote actually comes from the agony in the garden, of which there were no waking witnesses. So, like me, it's either odd or inspired."},

Wondrous! I suppose it means to think out  - excogito ergo summarise.Indeed, the OED says that it does mean think out, and moreover contains the wonderful adjective excogitous, used only once in 1646 in the sentence \"Impatience is very excogitous.\"An excogitous statue"},

You'll need to know that Richard Burbage was the lead actor in Shakespeare's company. He was the first Hamlet, the first Macbeth, and the first Richard III. Now read on:Upon a time when Burbage played Richard III there was a citizen grew so far in liking with him that before she went from the play she appointed him to come that night with her by the name of Richard III. Shakespeare, overhearing their conclusion, went before, was entertained, and at his game ere Burbage came.

Lethologica was invented by Carl Jung and is simply a combination of lethe - forgetfulness - and logica- wordy. In Greek mythology there was a river of forgetfulness in the underworld called Lethe. When you bathed in Lethe you forgot everything and were washed in sweet oblivion. That's why Keats opens Ode to a Nightingale with:My heart aches and a drowsy numbness painsMy senses, as though of hemlock I had drunk,Or emptied some dull opiate to the drainsOne minute past and Lethewards had sunk.Similarly, when Hamlet's dead daddy reveals that he's been murdered, he's pleased to see that Hamlet gets antsy:...duller shouldst thou be than the fat weedThat roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,Wouldst thou not stir in this. There's also some poem where Time sits on the banks of Lethe throwing people's names in to the water, but I can't remember what it is. Perhaps it's Dante. It sounds like Dante. Anybody know?

Gay abandon can survive in football, of all sweaty and uncouth places, without anybody batting an eyelid. But gay?

{"title": "Cry Havoc", "date": "Tuesday 19 April 2011", "text": "Havoc is a funny old word. I think that I only use it myself in the phrase play havoc, as in \"Ortolan plays havoc with my digestion\". This is because I never realised that havoc is, technically, a military command. There are two bits, you see, to being a soldier. There are the battles, which are rather difficult and require discipline. Then, when the battle is won and there are only civilians left, the soldier's fun really starts.So once the general is happy that the enemy has been routed and the city is ours he gives the order to his men that they may plunder, pillage and ransack everything that isn't bolted down and some things that are. This order is Havoc, because havoc literally means plunder.  And once the general has cried havoc the troops can do whatsoever and whomsoever they like. Once you realise that crying havoc was a standard part of warfare and, indeed, goes straight back to the French crier havoc, Mark Antony's promise to Julius Caesar's corpse makes a lot more sense:Blood and destruction shall be so in useAnd dreadful objects so familiarThat mothers shall but smile when they beholdTheir infants quarter'd with the hands of war;All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,With Ate by his side come hot from hell,Shall in these confines with a monarch's voiceCry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;That this foul deed shall smell above the earthWith carrion men, groaning for burial.Ate, by the way, was a goddess who personified a mad impulse towards destruction.

{"title": "The Four and Twenty Letters", "date": "Monday 18 April 2011", "text": "In Sir Francis Bacon's essay Of Friendship, I came across this:As for business, a man may think, if he will, that two eyes see no more than one; or that a gamester seeth always more than a looker-on; or that a man in anger is as wise as he that hath said over the four and twenty letters; or that a musket may be shot off as well upon the arm as upon a rest; and such other fond and high imaginations, to think himself all in all. The reason it is four and twenty lessons is that, in the orthographically straitened times in which Bacon lived, there were only twenty-four letters in the alphabet. They managed this because u and v were considered the same letter, as were i and j. That's why in those renaissance paintings of the crucifixion the letters INRI are written on the cross. INRI stands for Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum, or Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews. We would therefore write JNRJ, but that's because we have more letters than we know what to do with.What really strikes me about Bacon's allusion is that reciting the twenty four letters was the standard method of calming down. Where we would say \"Take a deep breath and count to ten\", they would take a deep breath and recite the entire alphabet, which must, I suppose, be 140% more effective, assuming emotions to run on linear mathematics. This means that renaissance England must have been a much calmer place than modern and furious Britain.Mind you, a few pages away there's a lovely comment that:...it is the nature of extreme self-lovers, as they will set an house on fire, and it were but to roast their eggs. Which seems a pretty damned furious method of cookery. I confess, though, that what I really love about that last quotation is that it is, technically, Bacon on eggs.Breakfast is on its way"},
{"title": "Logopandocie", "date": "Sunday 17 April 2011", "text": "There's often a slight problem when I do one of these posts on obscure yet delightful words: Is it a real word? And what can you possibly mean by the word real? If lots of people use a word, then it's real. But what about words there were used only once or twice? Any fool can invent a word - let's say flobdollody - and claim that it means a desire to eat unicorns, and use it once. Nobody will take any notice of it, of course, and it will never make the dictionary. If Shakespeare thinks up a word it automatically qualifies for the OED, because Shakespeare was the greatest writer who ever breathed. But there are other scribblers who seem to get all their coinages into the hallowed Oxonian pages of the Richard Snary. Sir Thomas Urquhart, for example, has 372 of his own inventions tucked away in the dictionary, one of which is logopandocie.Logos was Greek for word, and also for meaning and truth and all sorts of other things. When John's Gospel opens with \"In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God\", it's logos in the original* Greek.Meanwhile, pandokeia was inn-keeping, it was the practice of running a tavern. Now the thing about a tavern is that anyone who feels like it can wander in, and they often do. So logopandocie is running a word tavern, or, as the OED puts it, a readiness to admit all kinds of words. It's applicable to a dictionary, to a language, and this blog.An editorial meeting at Inky Fool Mansions*Well, it was probably originally in Aramaic, but that's another story."},

{"title": "Terror, Pity and Soup", "date": "Wednesday 13 April 2011", "text": "Inexplicably, I have been reading a book from 1765 called Tour to London. It's by a Frenchman called Pierre-Jean Grosley who wanted to explain to his countrymen exactly what's wrong with the English. There's the obvious stuff about English cooking (we are, apparently, \"strangers to soup\"), but there's some interesting stuff about the theatre. It's in the section on why the English are so melancholy.Bascially, Grosley thinks it's all Shakespeare's fault. His analysis is fascinating because it's essentially a brief account of English dramatic theory in the mid-eighteenth century, with all sorts of funny details about staging.The theatrical exhibitions of the English equally contribute to feed, or rather increase the national melancholy. The tragedies, which the people are most fond of, consist of a number of bloody scenes, shocking to humanity…Scenes of battery and carnage are generally preceded by laying a large thick carpet upon the stage, to represent the field of battle, and which is afterwards carried off with the dead bodies, to leave the trap doors at liberty for the ghosts…[The ghosts torment their murderers and...]It is easy to guess what effect this must have upon the imaginations of the English. They are very ready to carry their children to the playhouse; alleging the same reasons for this practice that are elsewhere given for sending young persons to public executions. The impression they make upon the young people is so lively and durable, that, notwithstanding  they have none of those prejudices, which are kept up in Roman Catholic countries  by the belief of purgatory, and several stories relative to that article, there are few nations, which, without believing in apparitions in theory, are really more afraid of them in practice.What struck me about this last bit was that in 1765 the English still saw the point of tragedy as essentially moral. Plays had a purpose, and that purpose was to teach you not to be bad by showing rotters getting their comeuppance. It's exactly the same idea that Sidney had put down a couple of centuries before:The high and excellent tragedy, that openeth the greatest wounds, and showeth forth the ulcers that are covered with tissue; that maketh kings fear to be tyrants, and tyrants to manifest their tyrannical humoursThough Oscar Wilde put it more succinctly:The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what Fiction means.These days, when presented with the choice between pity and terror, we usually choose the former. A tragedy is about a blameless chap who gets cancer, or a little kitten that strays too close to the kebab van. We still like our criminals, but Tony Soprano doesn't get killed. So there is no terror, and the old idea of tragedy is only half there. Tragedy is now as much a stranger to crime as the English are to soup.Means nothing to me"},

I know that sounds like a lot to get into two syllables but it's probably something like mannikin. I don't know. I don't speak Tibetan, and the way things are going I probably never will.What really surprised me was that they were little, but the OED insists on it and quotes Sherpa Tensing:He describes it as half man half beast, about five feet six inches tall, covered with reddish-brown hair but with a hairless face.Which is rather less impressive than I had imagined. I was at school with someone like that. The Tibetans also call them Meetoh Kangmi, which means Abominable Snowmen. This is a much older and much better name than the badly transliterated yeti. Abominable is such a lovely word: a bit religious and a bit old fashioned: like a communion wafer dipped in gentleman's relish.

In Medieval wedding services the wife would promise the following:I take thee, John, to be my wedded husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer and poorer, in sickness and health, to be bonny and buxom, in bed and at board, till death do us part, and thereto I plight thee my troth.Now, this seems to our modern eyes to be a strange sort of promise. How could a wife guarantee that she would be buxom? Were thin women unable to marry in church? However, the word buxom has changed in meaning over the years. The first citation of buxom in the OED comes from the twelfth century and is defined as: Obedient; pliant; compliant, tractable. The sense then changed to happy, then to healthy, and thence to plump.Meanwhile bonny comes from the French bon and the Latin bonus, both of which mean good. So a bonny and buxom wife was a good and obedient one, which is why it was eventually replaced by loving, honouring and obeying. There's even a sixteenth century reference to being \"bonnaire and buxome to the Pope\".Anyway, this form of the service is still occasionally used. There's a story about it here."},

{"title": "The Literary Boot", "date": "Sunday 3 April 2011", "text": "I said a few weeks ago that I'd be putting up poems that were hung on the walls of pubs, and I found a bit of verse in the Boot in Bloomsbury. The Boot has already achieved literary immortality as Dickens put it into Barnaby Rudge:This Boot was a lone house of public entertainment, situated in the fields at the back of the Foundling Hospital; a very solitary spot at that period, and quite deserted after dark. The tavern stood at some distance from any high road, and was approachable only by a dark and narrow lane; so that Hugh was much surprised to find several people drinking there, and great merriment going on. He was still more surprised to find among them almost every face that had caught his attention in the crowd; but his companion having whispered him outside the door, that it was not considered good manners at The Boot to appear at all curious about the company, he kept his own counsel, and made no show of recognition.Nothing whatsoever has changed, although there are now many more buildings around and about, and what the pub lacks in salubriousness it makes up for in proximity to the British Library*. Anyway, up on the wall they had a framed poem by a chap called Herbert Wilkes, of whom I can find no trace on the Internet. As it's a little hard to read from my photograph, I've copied out the poem. Essentially, he's just trying to work lots of pub names into rhyme. It's not a good poem, exactly, but it is fun. Incidentally, pub names are always things that you can paint pictures of, because in preliterate England people would meet at the sign of the red lion/unicorn/mitre et cetera, and recognise it by the picture hanging outside.A Run Across the SignsThere's my Black horse he'll face the LionAnd make the Bay horse flyHe'll turn the Wheat Sheaf upside downAnd drink the Fountain dryHe'll leave a mark upon the FleeceTake shine out of the StarAnd make King William sue for peaceBefore the Castle barHe'll crush the Midland on his tourAnd make the Shepherd screamDespatch Commercials any hourTo Devonshire for creamHe'll twist the Cross Keys out of shapeAnd fill the Nag with dreadThe Albion shall not escapeThe Hart must lose it's headHe'll make the New Ship spring a leakGive Craven Arms a jerkAnd make the Kings afraid to speakWhen Joiners are at workHe'll straighten up the Rose and CrownThe Royal Oak must fallHe'll knock the Cock and Bottle downAnd close the Hole in t'WallHe'll slip the Thanet's down a nickAnd make the Heifer grinThen cater off and throw the BrickBeyond the Railway InnHe'll make the Craven look forlornAnd strain Old George's hipDestroy the boasting UnicornAnd the upset the ShipHe'll make the White Horse scrape and bowThe Jolly Sailors fightThe Mason's Arms will strike a blowBefore the Sun is brightHe'll trample on the Woodman's sconeT'Black Bull will turn awayAnd flight alone will save the SwanBefore he meets his day*Down Judd Street and off to the left."},

So when the Roman Empire had turned to Christianity and moved to Constantinople they decided to do away with the poor old month of Claudius and instead call it the Mensis Salvatoris de Christi in Excelsior, which thankfully didn't catch on.Instead, the month was named for the ancient tradition of Apus Regalus, or the Kingly Ape, which had existed in the kingdom of Pontus prior to the Roman invasion. Choroides puts it best in his second century classic Geographies:And in the Kingdom of Pontus they would, at that time, hold the ceremony of the Kingly Ape, which was a monkey that was given a crown of pure gold upon his head. Then each citizen of the place, both man and woman, would arm himself with a feather and all would pursue that monkey attempting to touch it's belly with the feather. It was said that if a citizen could make the monkey laugh by stroking its belly in this way, he would be given a position of great power within the state for the space of a year.

To sell, they needed to prove their potion's efficacy, and for that they needed a toad-eater.Toads, as everybody knew, were poisonous. So the toad-eater's job was to eat one and collapse into a shivering, floccillating heap. The doctor would then give the toad-eater a dose of his patent medicine and, before the eyes of the crowd, the toad-eater would regain his health.Obviously being a toad-eater was not a great job. Whether or not you actually ate your toad or only pretended to, it was a pretty humiliating way of making a living.A toad-eater called William Utting is recorded in 1629, and the word was shortened to toady in 1828, by Disraeli.P.S.

Once upon a time it meant with rapt attention, but as people only really attend to the things for which they yearn, the meaning shifted and drifted to its sorrowful modern form.The OED tries to take it all back to whistly, which meant silently once. This means that there may just perhaps maybe a connection to the card game. Originally, there was a game of whisk, but whisk became whist for no reason that anybody can really work out. It may have been that it was a game where you were meant to keep quiet about the cards you had, and play whistly.We need a word like wistful, there's a very particular human emotion and it doesn't really matter whether we know what wist is, we're all brimming with it now and then.And here is some unrelated wisteria."},

Or it has in London.This is the time when hibernating creatures yawn, stretch and emerge from the hibernacles: a hibernacle being the place where you spent the winter. Hiber was* Latin for winter. Those Romans who visited Ireland decided that the weather there was so bloody awful that they would call the land Hibernia, which means winterland.But there is an opposite of hibernation. All you need to do is take the hiber out, replace it with the Latin for summer, aestas, and you get aestivation. Aestiavating (sometime estivating) is the practice of going to sleep until it's autumn again. It's a rather tempting prospect, but the only mammal that does so is the Malagasy fat-tailed dwarf lemur, and I'd hate to be mistaken for one of them. In fact, I feel that whichever naturalist named the Malagasy fat-tailed dwarf lemur was probably in a malevolent mood at the time.Oddly enough, I've already written one post on Malagasy lemurs. You wouldn't have thought it would be a subject that repeats on a blog about the English language. But lemurs are fascinating creatures. Lemur itself comes from the Latin lemures, which meant the malignant spirits of the unburied dead. You see, lemurs only come out at night and make very strange noises.If attacked by an ancient Roman lemur you should offer it black beans to eat, or failing that bang brass pans together to frighten it away. This is the reason that in Goethe's Faust Mephistopholes summons up a terrifying troop of lemurs, which sing:LEMUREN:Wir treten dir sogleich zur Hand,Und wie wir halb vernommen,Es gilt wohl gar ein weites Land,Das sollen wir bekommen.Gespitzte Pfähle, die sind da,Die Kette lang zum Messen;Warum an uns den Ruf geschah,Das haben wir vergessen.Look, fat-tailed dwarf lemurs!*I know, hiems, but I'm keeping it simple."},

Zooming can only happen in cameras and in the imagination, and it was the imagination that got there first, with the lens-makers scuttling along behind. The first zoom is credited to Milton.The article misses, though, my favourite poetic zoom, which comes from the opening of an Auden poem:Consider this and in our timeAs the hawk sees it or the helmeted airman:The clouds rift suddenly - look thereAt cigarette end smouldering on a borderAt the first garden party of the year.The parted clouds to the cigarette end, faster than any film could make sense of the matter.Two other little linguistic points were suggested by the article. First, an animalcule is a small or worthless animal. The word isn't in the OED, but that's what -cule always means. Second, zoom is onomatopoeic. The word was originally applied to the flight of aircraft, and specifically to the noise made when the throttle is opened and the aircraft shoots upwards - zoooom. The camera meaning is recorded from 1948.Anyway, go and have a look at the article. The weather's horrible* and any notion that you have something better to do with your Sunday is a delusion.

{"title": "Hotbed", "date": "Friday 18 March 2011", "text": "While listening to the radio yesterday, it occurred to me that I had no idea what a hotbed was. I've heard the phrase a thousand times (usually in relation to sin), and it turns out that I've seen them too. I simply didn't know what they were.A hotbed is a flowerbed enclosed in a glass case. This bed is heated, usually by the fermentation of manure, to make a flowerbed that is hot and therefore good for growing things in (but not, unfortunately for sinning in).Here is a diagram:As you can see, there is little room for those who like their sins spacious. There is, though, another sort of hotbed. Apparently in the cheapest of cheap American lodging houses one can, or could, be given a bed that was used by different people in rotation. The hotness here is the same hotness that warms a hot-desk, and is ideal for sinners. Neither hotbeds nor hot-desks, though, have much to do with a hotseat, which was, originally, the electric chair."},
{"title": "Nervous Nations", "date": "Thursday 17 March 2011", "text": "This is from the preface to Nathan Bailey's Universal Etymological Dictionary of 1721:Some have remark'd that there is a constant Resemblance between the Genius of each People and the Language which they speak, and thenceThe French who are a People of great Vivacity have a Language that runs extreme Lively and Brisk, and the Italians who succeeded the Romans have quite lost the Augustness and Nervousness of the Latin and sunk into Softness and Effeminacy, as well in their Language as their Manners.The Spaniards, whose distinguishing Character is a haughty Air, have a Language resembling their Qualities, yet not without Delicacy and Sweetness.The Romans who seem'd to be a People design'd for Command, us'd a Language that was noble, august and nervous.The Greeks who were a polite but voluptuous People, us'd a Language exactly adapted thereto.The English who are naturally Blunt, thoughtful and of few Words, use a Language that is very short, concise and sententious.Quite aside from the truth of all this, it's strange to see how the word nervous has changed in meaning. Nerves were once identified with the sinews. So nervous was a synonym for sinewy, and meant tough.Similarly, sententious was once a word of praise. A sentence used to be an opinion or judgement (which sort of survives, in that a trial ends up with a judge giving a sentence). From that you got the idea that a single opinion could be expressed in a sentence, hence a grammatical sentence. So, if your speech is not vapid and meaningless, if it contains a thought, it is sententious.T.S. Eliot used the old sense of sentence in The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock. It should therefore be stressed on the second syllable.No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be; Am an attendant lord, one that will do To swell a progress, start a scene or two Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool, Deferential, glad to be of use, Politic, cautious, and meticulous; Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse; At times, indeed, almost ridiculous— Almost, at times, the Inky Fool.

So the word is nearly virginal and should be taken out and shown to the world.The Latin for kiss was osculare, and the obscure English words thence derived are wonderful. There's an osculatrix (a lady who kisses), an oscularity (a kiss), and an osculary (anything that can and should be kissed (although this was usually a religious relic)).So repeat after me:Pretty? She's a regular osculary.It's one short of fangast.There are also a fair few osculatory words in geometry, for when two curves touch at a single point they are said to kiss."},

The Merchant of Venice contains not a solitary reference to gondolas or canals, and nor does Othello. As Holofernes says in Love's Labours Lost:I may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice;Venetia, Venetia, Chi non ti vede non ti pretia. Which means Venice, Venice, he who has not seen you cannot appreciate you.And that seems to have been the case with Will. To be fair, Venice in Shakespeare's time ruled a lot of territory on the mainland.

{"title": "The Handkerchief's Cargo", "date": "Wednesday 9 March 2011", "text": "I have been suffering from a horrid cold for the last week. Every couple of minutes I put a vast, sail-like handkerchief to my face and imitate the mating cry of the victorious walrus. Here are some useful words for those similarly bemucused.Snite was an Old English word that meant to blow your nose. It is now out of use, though its meaning is still obvious because its wordchild, snot, survives.Emunction is a very posh form of nose-blowing indeed. I picked up the word from Beckett's Trilogy which has:...certain habits such as the finger in the nose, the scratching of the balls, digital emunction and the peripatetic piss...According to the OED, emunction is both obscure and obsolete; but it's awfully good for rhymes.You need to be careful, though, as it can technically mean the emptying of any bodily passage.Gleimous means full of phlegm (but not, necessarily phlegmatic).Finally, handkerchief is an oxymoron. Hand means hand (isn't etymology complicated?). Kerchief comes from Old French couvre-chief, which meant head-covering. So a handkerchief is a head-scarf for your hand (and nose).Othello says of his handkerchief:'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:A sibyl, that had number'd in the worldThe sun to course two hundred compasses,In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;And it was dyed in mummy* which the skilfulConserved of maidens' hearts.What a terrible thing it would have been if Desdemona had had a cold like mine.*A medicinal liquid extracted from mummies.

As Auden put it:They never forgot That even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot Where the dogs go on with their doggy lifeIn the end, our heroic autobiographies are all written in doggerel, which means little dog. Nobody is quite sure why. Perhaps doggerel is the sort of writing that would appeal to a puppy. But perhaps there is a better explanation deducible from the words first* recorded use in The Canterbury Tales. When it finally comes round to Chaucer's turn to entertain the pilgrims with a story, the narrator starts to tell the Tale of Sir Thopas. It's a truly terribly story about a knight and a not very frightening monster, and nobody wants to hear the end, for, as the landlord says:Mine ears achen of thy drasty [shitty] speech.Now swich a rhyme the devil I biteche!This may well be rhyme doggerel,\" quod he.\"Why so?\" quod I, \"why wilt thou lette meMore of my tale than another manSyn that it is the best tale I can?\"\"By God,\" quod he, \"for plainly at a wordThy drasty rhyming is not worth a turd.\"So I humbly submit, dear reader, that doggerel is the little bit of dog that is left behind on the pavement, and that rhyme doggerel was originally dog-turd rhyme.*There are earlier records of doggerel as a name, but they don't appear to have anything to do with poetry."},

This was true of cappuccinos and Capuchin monks, and is just as true of inauguration.When you begin something new, it is a good idea to call in a soothsayer, or augur, to see how it will turn out. They can tell you whether today is a good day to start, and whether you should start at all. This is the inauguration.Augur itself may come from avis, meaning bird, because Roman augurs used to chop up our feathered friends in order to find the future in the belly of a pigeon. Augur may, though, be the cousin of augment because the purpose of an augur was to predict an increase (or augmentation) in crops.If augur does come from augment, then it relates to author, as an author is somebody who increases and augments the number of a books in the world.

{"title": "Thomas Paine, Confucius and the Three Monkeys", "date": "Sunday 6 March 2011", "text": "A pleasant detail about Confucius: Confucius is a Latinization of the Chinese Kong-zi, which means Master Kong, or...Oh, yeah.Confucius is King Kong.What's the relevance of this?Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.This phrase is usually (and understandably) taken to refer to a seventeenth century Japanese sculpture that sits over the door of a shrine at Toshogu. Here's a picture.Why monkeys? Because the Japanese phrase for hearing, seeing and speaking no evil is mizaru, kikazaru, iwazaru, and zaru is pronounced the same as saru, which means monkey. Hence the sculpture. This is the explanation given in all the dictionaries as the origin of the phrase Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.It's all very well, but what about this passage from a letter of Thomas Paine in 1802?As to the hypocritical abuse thrown out by the federalists on other subjects, I recommend to them the observance of a commandment that existed before either Christian or Jew existed.\"Thou shalt make a covenant with thy senses, \"With thine eye, that it beholds no evil. \"With thine ear, that it hear no evil. \"With thy tongue, that it speak no evil. \"With thy hands that they cemmit no evils. If the Federalists will follow this commandment, they will leave off lying.THOMAS PAINE. Federal City, Lovett's Hotel, Nov. 20, 1802. So what? I hear you cry. Thomas Paine must have been to Japan. But Japan, at the time, was under Sakoku, a policy of splendid isolation whereby nobody was allowed in and nobody was allowed out*. Sakoku lasted from 1633 to 1853 so Thomas Paine cannot possibly have known about the three monkeys in the shrine at Toshogu.So where did he get it from?That's where Confucius comes in. Section Twelve of the Analects has this:\"Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to propriety.\"Thomas Paine was rather keen on Confucius and he must have imported the phrase directly from the Analects, and not from the three Japanese monkeys. This leads us to the vital question of whether Paine is right to assert that the phrase is older than \"Christian or Jew\".Confucius' birth is usually given as 551 BC, which I reckon is pre-Christian. The word Jew is a shortening of Judaean, meaning the fellows from the Kingdom of Judaea. Israel was united (probably) by Saul in the eleventh century BC. In the tenth century there was a civil war and it split into two halves: one half in the north called the Northern Kingdom and one in the south called Judaea. This situation continued until around 720 BC when the Assyrians came and wiped the Northern Kingdom out, leaving only the Judaeans.So the usual system of nomenclature is that prior to 720 they were Israelites and after that they were Jews. By my calculation this means that Thomas Paine was out in his dating by a minimum of 169 years.*There were limited exceptions to Sakoku, but the prospect of somebody making notes about one sculpture at one shrine is pretty damned unlikely."},

The following from the second edition.At present, after exchanging a few parting words, and a few final or farewell farewells with my faithful female agent...But there's a footnote to this half-sentence. The footnote reads:Some people are irritated, or even fancy themselves insulted, by overt acts of alliteration, as many people are by puns. On their account, let me say, that, although there are here eight separate f's in less that half a sentence, this is to be held as pure accident. In fact, at one time there were nine f's in the original cast of the sentence, until I, in pity of the affronted people, substituted female agent for female friend.I always attempt to add as many alliterations as I am able to without awkwardness. For example, the luxuries of life above was originally the pleasures of life. Mind you, nine in a row is pushing it. Alliteration is like picking pockets: very profitable so long as it's not noticed.

I thought so. You never were one for hard work, were you, dear reader? The connection is in the sedge.Sedge is any kind of plant that grows on the banks of a lake or stream. More recently its meaning has dwindled to refer to plants of the cyperaceae family; and, really, unless you're a water-vole, the only place that you'll have heard of it is in the Keats poem.This takes us to a suburb of Harrogate in Yorkshire with a small stream flowing through it. Here is a picture of that stream*:You will notice the depressing lack of sedge. It must have wither'd, for there was sedge there once, as the suburb's name is Sedge-stream, except it's not. Yorkshire was, a thousand and bit years ago, overrun by Vikings, so most of their place names are Scandinavian, and the Viking word for Sedge-stream is Star-beck.Starbeck is only recorded from 1817 but it must have been around before because a) It has a Viking name and b) there were people there who had sex as early as 1379. This sex produced families, and those families were called, by a slight alteration in the name, Starbuck. Since 1379 two things have happened: the Quaker movement was founded and America was discovered.The result of this double-catastrophe was that among the first settlers on Nantucket Island was a Quaker family called Starbuck. Nantucket was a centre of the whaling industry and the Starbucks took up their harpoons and set off to seek their oily fortunes at sea. Valentine Starbuck met the King and Queen of Hawaii and took them to London where they got measles and died. Obed Starbuck sighted a coral atoll in the middle of the Pacific which was later named Starbuck Island in Valentine's honour. The point is that the Starbucks were famous whalers, which brings us to Moby Dick.Moby Dick is about a bunch of sailors having a whale of a time (whale, in case you were wondering, was early C20th American slang for a lot - whale of a job etc). The first mate of the whaling ship Pequod is called Starbuck, because the Starbucks were such prominent whalers. Moby Dick, aside from having a vaguely amusing name, is a favourite with American schoolteachers, which brings us to Jerry Baldwin.Jerry Baldwin was an English teacher from Seattle, who in 1971, along with a couple of friends, decided to start a coffee shop. He wanted to name it Pequod, after the ship in Moby Dick but was shouted down by his partners who pointed out that Pee is not a good syllable to have in a shop selling liquids.So the others cast around for a local name and found that there was an abandoned mining town near Mount Ranier called Camp Starbo. At this point Jerry Baldwin piped up and suggested a compromise. If he couldn't have Pequod, what about Starbucks,which sounds a little like Starbo and is a character in Moby Dick. They decided that this was a good name, and the rest is bad coffee.And it all goes back to a sedge-covered stream in Yorkshire.Gone fishin'*Stolen from Flickr without a flicker of conscience."},

{"title": "Galvanise", "date": "Monday 28 February 2011", "text": "According to a beautiful sentence on the BBC website:Almost spontaneously, the Libyan city of Benghazi has been galvanised into action.That this sentence is nigh-on meaningless is not our concern, our concern is with the word galvanised, and what it has to do with a frog's testicles.Once upon a time, in 1791, there was an Italian fellow called Luigi Galvani who thought that frogs' testicles were contained in their legs. Even the best of us have stray thoughts like that occasionally, but Galvani decided to cut a frog's leg open to see if he could find them.He couldn't, but something odd happened. He had previously been experimenting with static electricity and one of his scalpels contained enough charge that when it touched the frog there was a little spark and the frog's leg kicked. This was odd as the frog was dead and the leg had been cut off.Galvani became excited. Luckily his friend Alessandro Volta had just started making primitive batteries called Voltaic piles (from which we get volt), so Luigi was able to have great fun massacring frogs, hooking them up, and making them dance. I remember my old science teacher explaining that he had attached a thousand frogs to a huge metal frame and waited for a thunderstorm and watched them kan-kan. I do not know whether this is true.Anyway, Volta suggested that the phenomenon should be called galvanism, and so it was. The world was fascinated by the idea that a dead frog could be reanimated by electricity. It made people wonder. In 1818 Mary Shelley wondered:Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated; galvanism had given token of such things: perhaps the component parts of a creature might be manufactured, brought together, and endured with vital warmth.And thus wrote Frankenstein. Charlotte Brontë wrote about being galvanised to \"new and spasmodic life\" and Sydney Smith advised \"Galvanise a frog, don't galvanise a tiger\".This illustration should make it all clear.P.S. You can also use galvanism to coat things in metal.P.P.S. Whilst researching I came across this passage in Havelock Ellis, which tells you lots of fun stuff about the Scientific Mind:Goltz confirmed Spallanzani's observations and threw new light on the mechanism of the sexual instinct and the sexual act in the frog. By removing various parts of the female frog Goltz found that every part of the female was attractive to the male at pairing time, and that he was not imposed on when parts of a male were substituted. By removing various of the sense-organs of the male Goltz further found that it was not by any special organ, but by the whole of his sensitive system, that this activity was set in action. If, however, the skin of the arms and of the breast between was removed, no embrace took place; so that the sexual sensations seemed to be exerted through this apparatus. When the testicles were removed the embrace still took place. It could scarcely be said that these observations demonstrated, or in any way indicated, that the sexual impulse is dependent on the need of evacuation. Professor Tarchanoff, of St. Petersburg, however, made an experiment which seemed to be crucial. He took several hundred frogs (Rana temporaria), nearly all in the act of coitus, and in the first place repeated Goltz's experiments. He removed the heart; but this led to no direct or indirect stoppage of coitus, nor did removal of the lungs, parts of the liver, the spleen, the intestines, the stomach, or the kidneys. In the same way even careful removal of both testicles had no result. But on removing the seminal receptacles coitus was immediately or very shortly stopped, and not renewed."},

The breakthrough had been made by none other than Colonel Gaddafi. He had realised and then proved that Shakespeare was not called Shakespeare, he was called Sheik Zbir (or Zubair) and that he was, in fact, an Arab.Gaddafi's reasoning is so simple that I need hardly repeat it here. Suffice to say that Macbeth is taken from The Thousand Nights and One Night, that Romeo and Juliet is just a combination of Leila and Manjoon and Quys and Lubna, and that Othello is simply a reworking of the Tale of Kamar Al Zaman.I went to have a look at the Tale of Kamar Al Zaman, and, though I couldn't quite see how William Sheik Zbir had plagiarised it, I did find the lovely word wrongously, as in:...the Prince had been falsely accused and wrongouslyWrong as wrongously may sound today, it was a common word right up until the nineteenth century. As wrongously's meaning is so clear I think that wrongously could and should and must be revived.

{"title": "Fluke", "date": "Tuesday 22 February 2011", "text": "A Word A Day, has just put up the word fluke. Fluke has several meanings: it can be a funny little fish, the point of an anchor, or a stroke of luck. This latter is put down by AWAD as \"of uncertain etymology\" (1857).The OED is a little more helpful. It says that fluke was originally a lucky shot in billiards, and suggests that it might have something to do with the Whitby dialect word fluke, meaning guess, although that wasn't recorded until 1876, so it's probably the other way round.This all made me curious.I chased up the OED's first citation of fluke. It's from Notes and Queries and is actually about the origin of the word fluke:Billiards. — In playing at billiards, if a player makes a hazard, & c. which he did not play for, it is often said that he made a crow. It may be derived from the expression of \" Shot at a pigeon and killed a crow\". Another term is, \" He made a flook (or fluke).\" It seems to me that, as there are two flooks to the anchor of a ship, and as when the anchor shall be dropped either flook may take hold of the ground (as both do not, so that it is accidental which takes hold), the flook, at playing at billiards, may have reference to the same cause (accident). The favour of an answer will oblige.A Billiard Player.Oriental Club.Good, but not good enough for the OED.So I did some sniffling around of my own. It turns out that the billiard player at the Oriental Club and the OED have both missed an easy pot: namely a comic novel of 1853, four years before Notes and Queries. It's called The Adventures of Mr Verdant Green, An Oxford Freshman by Cuthbert Bede (well, in truth, it's not by Cuthbert Bede, that was just the pen-name of Edward Bradley, but we'll let that pass); and the relevant passage is herefollowing:Besides these out-of-door sports, our hero also devoted a good deal of his time to acquiring in-door games, being quickly initiated into the mysteries of billiards, and plunging headlong into pool. It was in the billiard-room that Verdant first formed his acquaintance with Mr. Fluke of Christ Church, well known to be the best player in the University, and who, if report spoke truly, always made his five hundred a year by his skill in the game. Mr. Fluke kindly put our hero \"into the way to become a player;\" and Verdant soon found the apprenticeship was attended with rather heavy fees.Now, there are two possibilities here: the first is that the slang word fluke was already around in 1853 and the author wanted to give his character a funny name. This seems unlikely. It's hardly a good joke to use a word so obscure that it had never appeared in print before.The other possibility is that the word came from the novel. But is this possible? Was it an influential tome? You need to sell a lot of copies to get a word into the language. Did anyone read Verdant Green?Yes!According to the DNB:The first edition of The Adventures of Mr Verdant Green sold out in Oxford on the first day and the continuing success of the three narratives was affirmed when the outright copyright was acquired by James Blackwood in 1858 and a collected cloth-bound edition was issued. (By 1870 it had sold 100,000 copies.) So fluke, meaning a lucky shot at billiards, could have come from the once-famous, now-forgotten novel. Or was it just a coincidence?Then I thought of a simple test. If it was a comedy name derived from billiards slang, there wouldn't be any real Mr Flukes (reality tends to elude me rather a lot, like a bitter ex-girlfriend). The name would be like Gradgrind or Micawber or Doasyouwouldbedoneby.But if it was a real surname then it would be probable to the point of persuasion that the flukey chance derives from a pre-existent surname.With quivering fingers I Googled the words Fluke surname.Millions of the damn fellows. So far as I can tell from the Internet you can't move for real people called Fluke. My absolute favourite Fluke is John M. Fluke Jr. who runs the family financial business.Now, I'm sure that John Fluke is a good and competent man, in fact he must be super-competent to get anybody on earth to invest in a company called Fluke Capital Management.All of which convinces me that fluke, the chance, comes from Mr Fluke of Christ Church.Mr Fluke is back right, smoking and chalking."},

They would then stamp it with the mark of the Goldsmith's Hall, which guaranteed its value to a buyer.In the racy classic An Exact Abridgement of All the Statutes of King William and Queen Mary (1700) it says:Any Persons, Natives or Foreigners, who by themselves or others shall bring any sort of Wrought Plate between 1 Jan 1696. and 4 November, 1697. to any of his Majesty's Mints, or to such Persons as shall be Authorized to Recieve the same, shall be then and there paid for such Plate at 5 s. 4 d. per ex. And all such Plate, having the Goldsmiths Hall Mark and Workman's Mark, shall be Received as Sterling Silver*And that, my child, is where the word hallmark comes from. It's the mark of quality given out in Goldsmith's Hall. It's also why the building in the picture is the origin of all those greetings cards and the American TV channel.Well, in fact, that building wasn't erected until the 1820s. In William and Mary's time it looked like the picture below.By 1809 the word was being used figuratively to mean a characteristic stamp. So a sermon could have the hallmark of orthodoxy. Thus the cards.*The OED doesn't have a citation for hallmark until 1721, and nothing for the figurative use until 1864. Do I get a prize?"},

Meretricious sounds as though it should mean good and worthy, but in fact it means gaudy and flashy.The reason for this oddness is that the Latin word mereo meant I deserve or I earn, and that's where we get merit from. However, a lady who earned was therefore called a meretrix, and, ancient Rome being what it was, there weren't that many ways that a lady could make a living besides prostitution, and that's what meretrix came to mean.And from meretrix we got meretricious, which means tarted up.Incidentally, what do you call a woman who can balance a pint of ale on her nose?Beatrix."},

He was an Englishman but he ended up teaching theology to thirteenth century Parisian monks. As a teacher he would set aside three days during which his students were allowed to dispute with him upon any question they pleased. These were called quodlibets, which was Latin for whatever you want. Quodlibet is simply a much grander sounding word for what is now called a Q & A session.So great a quodlibetist was Alexander of Hales, that in all these disputes nobody ever managed to outdebate him. It was from this that he earned the title The Irrefragable Doctor, meaning the Doctor whose arguments can never be defeated.Irrefragable is a wonderful word, especially as it's a useful argumentative term. You can drop it into a dispute (The first two points are irrefragable, but point three is interesting because...) and thus put your opponent off his stride out of sorts.Not everybody liked Alexander of Hales. Roger Bacon said of his book the Summa Theologica Alexandri, that it weighs more than a horse and was made by other people.This may be why there is now a racehorse named after him.Incidentally, the Glossographia; or, A dictionary interpreting all such hard words, whether Hebrew, Greek or Latin... as are now used in our refined English tongue defines quodlibitaries as those that run after their own fancy or imagination, and do what they list, which sounds rather fun."},
{"title": "Thomas Jefferson's Mysterious Shag", "date": "Tuesday 15 February 2011", "text": "Here is a mystery that I can't solve, and it's driving me mad.Shag is an English verb for the world's most popular pastime.That it is English and not American was a central joke of Austin Powers, and a central flaw in the British marketing of the 1989 American romantic comedy Shag.So I was astonished to read the first citation in the OED. It's not English, but American. We've lost! Not just any old American, either: the first recorded shag is by Thomas Jefferson.He had shagged his mother and begotten himself on her body.That, I think you'll agree, is a pretty weird sentence. But the OED, of course, don't give context. They just have the line and the name of the book. So I ran down to the British Library to get hold of a copy and see what Jefferson was talking about.I don't know whether it's that Thomas Jefferson isn't important enough, but the British Library have never bothered to buy a copy. It's recent too. Though Jefferson wrote it in 1770, it wasn't published until Princeton University press put it out in 1997.But it's not there, dammit. It's not on Google Books either. So I'm left with this one enigmatic sentence:He had shagged his mother and begotten himself on her body.What the hell does it mean? I've been thinking long and hard about this. Who shagged his mother? It's not Oedipus because he didn't beget himself. I looked up Sin and Death in Paradise Lost, but they don't fit.Then I came up with an odd idea. Maybe he's talking about Jesus. If you consider Jesus and God the Father to be one, then Jefferson's Shag might make sense. It's more than a trifle blasphemous, but I can't see what else he could have been writing about.Does anybody have a better suggestion?Does anybody have access to the original book? Any Princetonians? Anybody with another copyright library round the corner?If you do then it's:Thomas JeffersonJefferson's Memorandum Books volume II (ed.

The context is that it's all brief notes of court cases in which Jefferson was acting:Now, I'd like to say that that cleared it up, but really it's caskets within caskets. I still can't work out what the phrase means. It's hard enough to see who's suing who for what and why. The open vestry is mysterious.

(I've just conducted a brief field trip and didn't see any feathered fornication, but there was a frisky looking pigeon flapping about in a suggestive way.) How does this connect to Chaucer? Because he wrote a poem about birds falling in love. It's called the Parliament of Fowls, and if you like you can read it here.Essentially, Chaucer dreams that he goes to the garden of love and witnesses a bunch of birds choosing their spouses.For this was on Saint Valentines day,When every fowl cometh there to choose his mate,Of every kind that men thinke mayAnd that so huge a noise 'gan they makeThat earth, and air, and tree, and every lakeSo full was that unethe [hardly] was there spaceFor me to stand, so full was all the place.And that is the first ever reference to Valentine's Day being the day on which creatures choose their sweethearts. Slowly the idea was transferred from birds to people, and that's the cause of all the trouble.The Parliament of Fowls opens with some great lines on Love:The life so short, the craft so long to learn,Th'assay so hard, so sharp the conquering,The dreadful joy alway that slit so yerne [slides away]All this mean I by Love, that my feelingAstonyeth [is astonished] with his wonderful workingSo sore, iwis, that when I on him thinkNat wot I well wher [I don't know whether] I float or sink.And then these bookish and lonely lines:For all be that I know not Love in deed,Nor wot how that he quitteth [pays] folk their hire,Yet happeth me full oft in books readOf his miracles and his cruel ire.So unruffle your feathers, get your hackles up and find yourself a bird."},

Greek carpenters.Greek carpenters needed measuring rods to act as rulers. These were called kanons, so canon came to mean a rule or an accepted standard. For example, the Biblical canon, which is all the books conventionally included in the Bible; and the literary canon, which is the secular equivalent. Then there's the canon, or official list, of saints that you can enter if you are canonised. And there's the rule, or canon, of a religious order under which you can live and thus become a canon like Canon Kir.Finally, you can compose music using complicated rules.

{"title": "The Cardinal's Sinful Numbers", "date": "Thursday 10 February 2011", "text": "Once upon an ancient Roman time, there were hinges, which were called cardos. If something belonged to the hinge it was cardinis. The word was of great metaphorical use as the centre-point around which things turned, for example the celestial poles. So the central and most important priests, those who elected the Pope, were called cardinalis ecclesiae Romanae: etymologically hinges of the church of Rome.Catherine of Aragon told Cardinals Wolsey and Campeius:The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;    (Recorded by Shakespeare and Fletcher in Henry VIII)But there isn't really a connection, only a common ancestor. Religious cardinals do not, or should not, commit cardinal sins. Nor did they decide which sins would be named after them. Cardinal sins are so-called because they are the central sins, on which all the other minor sins depend. They are the sinful hinges.So for example, the central cardinal sin of lust might result in your committing the particular sin of animal husbandry. Wrath might lead to murder, or violence, or simply taking the Lord's name in vain.Pope Paul VI may have had this in mind when, in 1974, he made Jaime Sin a cardinal, thus creating Cardinal Sin. Jaime himself liked the joke and referred to his official residence as the House of Sin.One of the many idiots who have tried to prove that Shakespeare didn't write Shakespeare, was a chap called Georg Cantor. He was a mathematician and invented set theory. He also coined the term cardinal numbers. As with the sins, cardinal numbers are the proper numbers (one, two, three, four) on which the ordinal numbers (first, second, third, fourth) depend.I shall leave you with Edmund Spenser's parade of the Seven Cardinal Sins from the Faerie Queen.

Notable primates include Saint Hilarius and Santa Claus.A bishop is defined in Grose's Dictionary as:A mixture of wine and water, into which is put a roasted orange. The lexicographic significance of this drink is recounted by Boswell in his life of Dr Johnson:One night, when Beauclerk and Langton had supped at a tavern in London, and sat till about three in the morning, it came into their heads to go and knock up Johnson, and see if they could prevail on him to join them in a ramble. They rapped violently at the door of his chambers in the Temple ,till at last be appeared in his shirt, with his little black wig on the top of his head instead of a nightcap, and a poker in his hand, imagining, probably, that some ruffians were coming to attack him.

Johnson made some attempts to help them ; but the honest gardeners stared so at his figure and manner, and odd interference, that he soon saw his services were not relished. They then repaired to one of the neighbouring taverns, and made a bowl of that liquor called Bishop, which Johnson had always liked : while in joyous contempt of sleep, from which he had been roused, he repeated the festive lines,Short, O short then be thy reign, And give us to the world again.They did not stay long, but walked down to the Thames, took a boat, and rowed to Billingsgate.

Cure and care come from the same Latin root: curare, which has nothing to do with the South American poison.A curate is exactly the same thing, etymologicalwise, as a curator, and the sense of taking care of pork or salmon is a reasonably obvious eighteenth century extension.In these fallen days, a curate is usually someone who substitutes for a vicar, which is odd as we've already seen that vicars are vicarious substitutes. None of which explains eggs.Here is a cartoon by George Du Maurier. It was published in Punch in 1895. Much of its humour has been lost because it satirises two things: the ambitious sycophancy of the Church of England and boiled eggs in the days before refrigerators. The joke is, of course, that an egg cannot be part-rotten.If you reworked it with a CEO and a middle manager, and replaced the eggs with lap-dancers you might have a good modern equivalent.

The OED's lackadaisicality means that I have no idea where the word lanspresado comes from. However, I can give you an explanation of a more English sounding equivalent: the snecklifter.You see a lanpresado has to prowl around. He goes to the pub, but of course he can't approach the bar unless he sees a friend already there. So he lifts the latch of the pub door, pokes his head in, sees if there's someone who'll buy him a drink and if there isn't he walks calmly away.An old word for a latch is a sneck and so a snecklifter is a chap who pokes his head into the pub to see if there's anyone who might stand him a little drink.Though I've checked that that's all true, I originally learnt it from the back of a bottle of beer, which goes to show something, but I'm not sure what.

{"title": "Minimal or Maximal", "date": "Wednesday 2 February 2011", "text": "I have been having fun today. I have been rewriting, improving and cutting. Here are the first ten pages of Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit by P.G. Wodehouse, but I've altered them slightly. I've cut out the unnecessary verbiage and rewritten them in the style of Ernest Hemingway. It is, I think you'll agree, a great improvement. I've also retitled it.A Farewell to the Old Man without Women Chapter OneI was in the bath. My Aunt had written asking me to meet some people called Trotter. I didn't want to go, but I would. It was business. I heard footsteps and sat up, alert. My valet was back. He told me that another letter had arrived by special courier asking me to invest a thousand pounds in a play. I refused. I had the money, and the play was written by my cousin. But I didn't care.Here, on the other hand, is the first paragraph of L'Etranger by Camus, rewritten in the style of P.G. Wodehouse. I've also retitled it.Hang It All!Chapter OneUsually, you know, I like to begin these memoirs of mine with something cheery. A good book, in my opinion, should brighten up the world, put a spring in the reader's step and a merry song on his lips. Some fellows love to be sombre and I suppose that they've got a right to it. There are those who don't consider a book worth reading unless they're sobbing their eyes out by the end of the first page. I've never understood that line myself and have always tried to start with something to rouse the sagging spirit and bend the corners of the mouth in an upward direction; but today I really can't. You see, I've had a bit of a blow. Today my dear old mother, the lady to whose tender dandling I owe my all, has kicked the proverbial bucket. I mean, I say today, but it could have been yesterday. All I got was a bare and bleak telegram with one sentence on it. Wallop! Well, you can imagine that I didn't take it too well. Really, these telegram chaps have all the compassion of an angry tigress. You'd think, wouldn't you, that when you're telling a fellow news like that you would at least give the chap some warning? Blows should be softened and pills sugared. They could begin:Dear Meursault, Poor yourself a triple snifter and sit down somewhere where you won't fall off, we've got some dark and drearies to impart.Then they could slip in some stuff about splendid innings and God gathering up his sunbeams and I wouldn't be sitting here foisting all this unpleasantness on you like a whining willow. I suppose I ought to catch the bus to Marengo.Why have I been making these improvements? Well, it's all to do with George Orwell.You see, I used to have a link up on the right of the blog to Orwell's essay Politics and the English Language. It's one of the classic essays on English prose and its general drift is that the words you use tend to fuddle your thoughts and those of the reader. Therefore, says Orwell, you ought to prune, prune, prune until you are left with the bare minimum needed to convey meaning.Anyway, a few weeks ago I noticed that there were far too many links up on the right and it was all getting rather cluttered. I had to take something down. I looked at the links and felt rather like the chap operating the lifeboat concession on the Titanic. But in the end I decided that Orwell could go. He'd had his spot for ages and it was time to make way for new blood etc etc.Then, last week, I posted a link to an article on prose that suggested the exact opposite. This other article had the idea that you should use as many words as you possibly could.It has been pointed out that this seems to be an inconsistency. I post one link and then I post another and you dear reader are left dizzy and disappointed by my traitorous tergiversations.Whose side am I on? Minimalist or maximalist? Am I a prosaic and prosodic Vicar of Bray? Do I have no loyalty, no constancy, no honour?Well, the truth is that I'm not on either side. I just thought that both arguments were interesting and carefully thought out. Being well dressed for a funeral is quite a different thing to being well dressed for the beach. The occasion is all and you're going to look a bit silly emerging from the sea in a black suit and tie or weeping over the coffin in your speedoes and flip-flops. It's the same with prose. Prose has a place and purpose and though I thought that I was improving Wodehouse and Camus, helping them out of their stylistic rut, sometimes I'm not so sure.Horses for courses, dear reader, and each to his own."},
{"title": "Re-Hearsing", "date": "Tuesday 1 February 2011", "text": "This from Wilt by Tom Sharpe. Mr Wilt is being questioned about the disappearance of his wife.'Interesting word \"rehearsal\",' he said. 'It comes from the old French, rehercer, meaning...''To hell with where it comes from,' said the Inspector, 'I want to know where it ends up.''Sounds a bit like a funeral too when you come think of it,' said Wilt, continuing his campaign of semantic attrition.Inspector Flint hurled himself into the trap. 'Funeral? Whose funeral?''Anyone's,' said Wilt blithely. 'Hearse, rehearse. You could say that's what happens when you exhume a body. You rehearse it though I don't suppose you fellows use hearses.'Well, if a passage like that won't send you scurrying to the dictionary, nothing will; and the connection to hearses is more than coincidental, it is rakish.Once upon a terribly long time ago there was a French word hercer, which meant to rake. This gave us three words: the first was herse, meaning rake which is now forgotten and mouldering in the garden shed of language.In modern English we still have the phrase to rake over something and that's exactly what rehearse meant. By Shakespeare's time rehearsal had already come to mean the preparation for a play, but you can, and I often do, rehearse old arguments and doctrines.Hercer gave us a candlestick, but to explain why I shall have to briefly explain Tenebrae. Tenebrae is a morning service performed over Easter. You have a great, big, fifteen-branched candlestick with fifteen lit candles. You say fourteen psalms and after each one you extinguish a candle, until there is only one flame left. At that point the priest slams his Bible shut with a strepitus, or great noise, and the last candle is then hidden under the altar to symbolise the death of Christ.Now, the first thing you'll notice is that strepitus is a fantastic word for the final, satisfying slamming shut of a long book that you've been reading for the last year. The second is that a fifteen branched candelabra is going to be huge. It is; and just for you I've added a picture on the right.Looks a bit a rake, doesn't it? It does. And that is why Tenebrae candlesticks are called hearses.Then people started putting candles over coffins: not directly on coffins, but on a framework just above, and that framework was called a hearse. And from that, in 1650, you got the carriage that carries a chap's last, wooden, bijou residence.All of which casts a glimmering light on the word rehearse in this Shakespeare sonnet:No longer mourn for me when I am deadThan you shall hear the surly sudden bellGive warning to the world that I am fledFrom this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:Nay, if you read this line, remember notThe hand that write it; for I love you soThat I in your sweet thoughts would be forgotIf thinking on me then should make you woe.O, if, I say, you look upon this verseWhen I perhaps compounded am with clay,Do not so much as my poor name rehearse,But let your love even with my life decay,Lest the wise world should look into your moanAnd mock you with me after I am gone.The Inky Fool's taxi had arrived"},

I cannot recommend it energetically enough. Imagine, if you will, that I am there in the room with you, brandishing a harpoon and with your loved ones trussed up in a corner telling you to click on the link.Enough for you?The one fault that I would find with the article is that it repeats the old canard that e-mail and the Internet are killing prose, that constant reading and writing have debased the art of writing by rendering it common and workaday.This is tripe. When I was a child, back in the 1980s, communication was by telephone and entertainment was obtained from the goggle-box. My infant fascination with prose was therefore somewhat strange. It was a useless talent because nobody wrote letters any more. The advent of e-mail changed that. A fixation on the difference between apposite and relative clauses suddenly became a social advantage; an apt colon was no longer the preserve of sodomites. I felt as a survivalist must feel when the bomb finally drops.Absence does not make the heart grown fonder; absence makes you forget. The crappiest lounge-bar pianist will have more appreciation of a virtuoso than somebody who has never touched a piano. Nudists are not wonderful judges of haute couture. Familiarity breeds knowledge, and knowledge breeds appreciation.The last ten years have been a decade of prose: the first really prosaic decade since the manufacture of the radio. People spend all day every day sending e-mails and each e-mail has a purpose: deal-clinching, informing, party-organising, raise-demanding, joke-telling, introduction and seduction. People want their e-mails to succeed, so they think on their words.An e-mailed joke must be funny without the aid of a winning smile and a funny accent. It must be constructed. Philanderers can no longer trade on a wink and a leer, they must get on a dating website and work on writing an irresistible profile.You can't spend all day wondering exactly how to phrase something, without beginning to see how clever Shakespeare was.It may change. In ten years time we may all be communicating by means of smell or sonar. But for now, the wordsmith rules and the poet prevails. This is the age of the word.The Inky Fool begins a long sentence"},
{"title": "Survival of the Fittest Fiddle", "date": "Friday 28 January 2011", "text": "A little note on Darwin. When we think of the adjective fit we are inclined to think of someone in jogging shorts and other such hideousness. Fit to us means physically capable and the fittest person is the fastest runner, or something of the sort. This is not the sense in which Darwin* used the phrase.We still use phrases like fit and proper parent or fit for purpose or not fit to hold office, and that was the original meaning of the word fit. It meant appropriate. The fittest word, is the word most appropriate to the situation.As Stephen Jay Gould once remarked, it doesn't matter how wonderfully developed a fish is, if all the oceans dry up it will die. Similarly, Darwin couldn't have cared less whether a Galapagos turtle could run fast, only that it was well suited to its environment.If the cap fits, it doesn't mean that it's been to gym.How did the word get from one to the other? On horseback. Or more precisely, via horse racing. If a horse was in fit condition for a race then it was fit in the modern sense.And fiddles? Nobody is quite sure why fiddles are fit, although it is certain that the older sense was being used. There also used to be a phrase as fine as a farthing fiddle, which makes more sense and is more fun to pronounce.The Inky Fool contemplating the gym*The phrase pops up in the fifth edition of On The Origin Of Species, although it was in fact invented by a chap called Herbert Spencer, who was trying to describe the ideas set out in the first edition of On The Origin Of Species.

It is a story about a small town. It is not a gossipy yarn; nor is it a dry, monotonous account, full of such customary “fill-ins” as “romantic moonlight casting murky shadows down a long, winding country road.” Nor will it say anything about tinklings lulling distant folds; robins carolling at twilight, nor any “warm glow of lamplight” from a cabin window. No. It is an account of up-and-doing activity; a vivid portrayal of Youth as it is today; and a practical discarding of that worn-out notion that “a child don’t know anything.”Any guesses? I'll give you a clue. It's not about what's there, but what isn't. Still no idea? Another clue: the idea was repeated thirty years later by Georges Perec. Yes? No? All right, I'll tell you.There are no Es. Not one. Gadsby is 50,000 words long and the fifth letter of the alphabet makes not a single, solitary appearance. He even went so far as to not allow himself Mr because it is a shortening of mistEr. You can read the introduction, and indeed the whole of Gadsby here. Its skill of composition is matched only by its insanity of purpose.The word for such a work is, incidentally, a lipogram.I was having a drink the other night with a girl who used to work for Bloomberg, the famous mayor manufacturer. Apparently, Bloomberg's style guide absolutely forbids the use of the word but. Nor can you replace it with however, yet, nonetheless or albeit. Each fact is an island, and they must remain in Gradgrindian lines and not use connectors to cancel each other out.Moreover, at Bloomberg you can't use adjectives of value. Profits can be neither good nor bad, large nor minor. They certainly can't be unexpected.It's good to know that the torch that Mr Wright lit has not gone out.N.B. The reason the for the picture. This post is about things that aren't there, which makes illustration tricky. This picture is of Dickens' study and was painted just after his death. It is called The Empty Chair because the chair implies the man who is not sitting in it. The picture was wildly popular and thousands of copies were made. My tutor at Oxford had a copy in his study. Van Gogh, who was a big Dickens fan and moved to London a few years after the novelist's death, loved the picture. That's why Van Gogh did all those paintings of empty chairs and empty beds, because the furniture implies the absent person."},

The strap in cash-strapped is a strap, but it is being used for safety reasons, not sensual ones.If you are falling or drowning then you need a strap to hang on to.

That loan is a metaphorical strap onto which you can hang above the oceans of insolvency.Therefore, if I have loaned you money, I have strapped you. Thus you are strapped for cash, or cash-strapped.Or at least that's how people talked in the mid-nineteenth century. These days we keep the same metaphor but call the strap a lifeline.

Bible-black is a lovely phrase because, even though my own copy of the King James Version is obstinately brown, I know exactly what he means. The alliteration of Bible-black also makes it a pleasure to say aloud.The Bible infects and infests our imaginations and our language. This is, dear reader, a Good Thing, because the language of the King James Version is bloody beautiful. John Ruskin once wrote:Walter Scott and Pope's Homer were reading of my own election, but my mother forced me, by steady daily toil, to learn long chapters of the Bible by heart; as well as to read it every syllable through, aloud, hard names and all, from Genesis to the Apocalypse, about once a year; and to that discipline -- patient, accurate, and resolute -- I owe, not only a knowledge of the book, which I find occasionally serviceable, but much of my general power of taking pains, and the best part of my taste in literature. From Walter Scott's novels I might easily, as I grew older, have fallen to other people's novels; and Pope might, perhaps, have led me to take Johnson's English, or Gibbon's, as types of language; but once knowing the 32nd of Deuteronomy, the 119th Psalm, the 15th of 1st Corinthians, the Sermon on the Mount, and most of the Apocalypse, every syllable by heart, and having always a way of thinking with myself what words meant, it was not possible for me, even in the foolishest times of youth, to write entirely superficial or formal English.Anything that keeps you away from Walter Scott is a blessing. However, Ruskin's mother must have been a terrifying woman: Psalm 119 is jormungandrian in length (it's an abecedarian acrostic in Hebrew). Deuteronomy 32, though, was a fine choice:My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grassAnd so it did, through the strange and sumptuous language of the KJV.I was reminded of all this by a splendid little article over at the BBC on the King James Bible and how it changed English.

You might be happy to be described as a Monet, if you didn't realise that it meant that you were beautiful from a distance, but rather disappointing from close up.Others are as obscure as a comma in hell. Few people have heard of the Venetian painter Vittore Carpaccio (1465-1526). He wasn't the greatest artist ever. In fact, his main talent was in the mixing of paints. He did the most lovely reds, and became famous for them. Have a look at the picture of the bedroom on the right. That is the work of a man who knows what his talent is.There was an exhibition of Carpaccio paintings at the Doge's Palace in Venice in 1961. Just round the corner from the Palace, at Harry's Bar, a chef called Giuseppe Cipriani was wondering what to call his brand new dish of thinly sliced red meat. And that, dear reader, is why carpaccio is called carpaccio.The dish and its name caught on, and that is why if you do a Google image search for Carpaccio, poor old Vittore is now down in ninth place, behind the food to which he posthumously donated his name.Giusseppe Cipriani also invented a cocktail, which he called a Bellini after another Venetian painter, Giovanni Bellini*. Giovanni Bellini painted what's probably my favourite painting: the San Giobbe Altarpiece.*I assume. I haven't checked up whether it was the Elder (and that's the worst line in Brideshead)."},

I once saw an advertisement for an exhibition at the British Museum that was continuing 'til April.So let's be very clear: round is not a shortening of around, to is not a shortening of unto and till is not a shortening of until. If you want to argue it historically (and I suspect you do), till has been around since 800, until didn't crop up ti'll 1200.There's something shuddersome about errors such as these. To be lazy is no disgrace, indeed it's rather charming.

Meanwhile a singer holds a note and that's the reason that the tenor of an article is not necessarily Pavarotti....where was I? Oh yes, modern novels. Too long.I am the slowest reader I have ever met. Years ago I did some involuntary voluntary* work in a homeless shelter. There was a chap there who called himself Animal. He told me that he had left school aged ten or thereabouts. He needed glasses and didn't have any. He was drunk. He still read more quickly than I did.To be fair, I make up for it by remembering everything I read, but it still means that I look at the printed breeze-blocks...Right, breeze is an old word for ash, which is why breeze-blocks are called cinder-blocks in America. Basically, there's ash in the concrete....I look, as I say, at the cinder-blocks that pass for novels these days and I think to myself that life is too short, and if The Blind Assassin is really that good, then they ought to have a copy in Heaven.

Pendle used to be called Penhul, from Pen in the Cumbric language meaning hill, and hul in Old English meaning hill. Once we moderns had added the Hill onto Pendle, we got Pendle Hill, or Hill-Hill Hill.Timor comes from timur in Malay, and guess what timur means? You're damned right, dear reader, it means East, because Timor lies at the Eastern end of a chain of islands. So East Timor is East East.The Mongolian for desert is Gobi, thus the Desert Desert; and the same thing applies to the Sahara Desert (from Arabic çaḥrā, meaning exactly what you guessed).And so on and so forth round and round this sad and repetitious globe. People, of course, name things for what they are. Then new people arrive, don't understand the name and think that they are clarifying things, when in fact they are building an unnecessary yet delightful heap of verbiage.Yet I only know of two places that have achieved the hat trick: Pendle Hill and Bredon Hill in Worcestershire, which comes from Bre (Celtic) Don (Old English) Hill, and therefore also means Hill Hill Hill.Which leads me to a not-that-good A.E.

His verse is filled with the three Victorian vices: unnecessary piety, unnecessary children, and unnecessary medievalisms. His most famous work is probably the following:A GARDEN is a lovesome thing, God wot!Rose plot,Fringed pool,Ferned grot—The veriest schoolOf peace; and yet the foolContends that God is not—Not God ! in gardens ! when the eve is cool?Nay, but I have a sign;‘Tis very sure God walks in mine.Reading that first line is like fighting George Foreman. There's the little jab of lovesome and just as you're disorientated, wondering why it wasn't lovely or pleasant - BAM! - you're hit full in the face by God wot!God wot meant God knows and was used for emphasis in the seventeenth century, but what's it doing here? It reads like the stained glass in a Victorian porch and then you realise it's only there to rhyme with the affected grot, and then with the clumsy construction God is not. Dear me, and pass the laudanum.But this terrible poem became terribly popular. It was anthologised in such works as Ye gardeyne boke: a collection of quotations instructive and sentimental, gathered and arranged and Scouting for Girls: The Official Handbook of the Girl Scouts. It's the sort of thing Mr Pooter probably wrote above his garden door.So famous did the line become that, in the 1930s, it gave a new and wonderful word to the English language: godwottery.Godwottery can mean two things. First, it can mean the use of affected archaisms, and verily, the poet that useth godwottery is a tosser, iwis.Godwottery can also mean tacky gardening. The collective noun for a horde of gnomes and charming water-features is godwottery. Here, for example, is Anthony Burgess writing in 1960:...little girls in pinafores of an earlier age shnockled over stained half-eaten apples; all the boys seemed to have cleft palates. Still, it seemed to me far healthier than the surrounding suburb. Who shall describe their glory, those semi-detacheds with the pebble-dash all over the blind-end walls, the tiny gates which you could step over, the god-wottery in the toy gardens?And, before you ask: No. I have no idea what shnockled means.

{"title": "Amazing Clues", "date": "Friday 7 January 2011", "text": "How vainly men themselves amaze...Old meanings are confusing enough without shoving two into a line, yet that is what Andrew Marvell did without a flicker of compunction in the opening line of The Garden. The modern reader would be almost excused for thinking that narcissistic men are going about impressing themselves. Though that may be so, Marvell is writing about men who futilely consign themselves to a labyrinth, or maze.Labyrinths are terrible places, teeming with minotaurs and littered with lost threads, or at least that's how I imagine them. Hampton Court was a disappointment. The reason, of course, is that I was exposed to the myth of Theseus as an infant, though the really dirty bits were thoughtfully concealed from me until I was six.Anyway, Theseus had to run into the labyrinth, kill the Minotaur and dash out again, all in time for tea. Ariadne, fearing that the tea would go cold, suggested the preposterously obvious idea that he take some thread with him, unwind it on the way in, and follow it on the way out. That way he would not be amazed.What with the Trojan horse and Ariadne's thread, one can see the Attic genius for the bleeding obvious. To stop himself getting lost he had a thread. And what was the medieval term for a ball of yarn? It was, dear threadbare reader, a clue.It was a clue that Theseus laid for himself in the labyrinth, it was a clue that led him back and dismazed him. If he had not had a clue of thread he would not have had a clue about how to escape. As John Pomfret wrote of the ideal woman:She knows the best, and does the best pursue,And treads the maze of life without a clue,That the weak only and the wavering lack,When they're mistaken, to conduct them back. She does, amidst ten thousand ways, prefer The right, as if not capable to err.Slowly, of course, the clue that leads you through the labyrinth became the key that solves the puzzle, and then became the hint that helps you to solve the puzzle, and then, in 1914, received its apotheosis when it was attached to crosswords.Incidentally, the original labyrinth (etymology uncertain) in which the Minotaur resided was designed by Daedalus, and has therefore been called a Daedal.Now read this lovely poem by Auden. It's called The Labyrinth.Anthropos apteros for daysWalked whistling round and round the Maze,Relying happily uponHis temperament for getting on.The hundreth time he sighted, though,A bush he left an hour ago,He halted where four alleys crossed,And recognized that he was lost.\"Where am I?\" Metaphysics saysNo question can be asked unlessIt has an answer, so I canAssume this maze has got a plan.If theologians are correct,A Plan implies an Architect:A God-built maze would be, I'm sure,The Universe in minature.Are data from the world of Sense,In that case, valid evidence?What in the universe I knowCan give directions how to go?All Mathematics would suggestA steady straight line as the best,But left and right alternatelyIs consonant with History.Aesthetics, though, believes all ArtIntends to gratify the heart:Rejecting disciplines like these,Must I, then, go which way I please?Such reasoning is only trueIf we accept the classic view,Which we have no right to assert,According to the Introvert.His absolute pre-suppositionIs - Man creates his own condition:This maze was not divinely built,But is secreted by my guilt.The centre that I cannot findIs known to my unconscious Mind;I have no reason to despairBecause I am already there.My problem is how not to will;They move most quickly who stand still;I'm only lost until I seeI'm lost because I want to be.If this should fail, perhaps I should,As certain educators would,Content myself with the conclusion;In theory there is no solution.All statements about what I feel,Like I-am-lost, are quite unreal:My knowledge ends where it began;A hedge is taller than a man.\"Anthropos apteros, perplexedTo know which turning to take next,Looked up and wished he were a birdTo whom such doubts must seem absurd.

That's why there's Cheapside and East Cheap in London. Cheap meant any sort of trade or bargaining or financial push-me-pull-you. If prices were low, it was a good cheap, just as with the French bon marché. If prices were high, it was a dear cheap, as in the Promptorium Parvulorum's:He byeth in tyme and at hour, so that he hath not of the dere chepe So a market man, a buyer or a seller, became a chapman. Then chapman dwindled to chap so that in The Beggar's Opera (1728) Peachum can say:Wife, rip out the Coronets and Marks of these Dozen of Cambric Handkerchiefs, for I can dispose of them this Afternoon to a Chap in the CityBy which he does not mean fellow, but customer.

{"title": "Expressly Expressing Express Espressos", "date": "Tuesday 4 January 2011", "text": "If you have ever expressed yourself on an express train, you may have wondered about the origin of the expression and why it should expressly mean that. You may then have settled down with an espresso and forgotten all about it.Once upon a terribly long time ago there was a Latin word exprimere, which meant to press out, and the past participle of which was expressus. When you press your seal* into soft wax you produce an image, and, so far as anybody can tell, that's why the Latin word took on the meaning of describing or representing something.Cows expressed milk, sores expressed pus and human beings were expressed by God. Very quickly people got the idea of expressing thoughts as words, as though the mouth were the udder of the mind. Thus Chaucer's:Thy virtue and thy great humilityThere may no tongue expressAlso from this came the idea of something that was specifically, or expressly, designed for one purpose and for no other. If God expressed man, he did it rather well, or at least that's what Hamlet thought:What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god!We still use this meaning when we say expressly. Thus today's Guardian:In a work expressly intended for students to perform, Pountney has created a dramatic structure that interlocks three stories of 20th-century student political action...So how do you send a letter? Do you entrust your epistle to the general mail, or do you employ somebody expressly to deliver it? Do you find a chap, give him one letter and express instructions? If so, then you have sent the letter express.The same sort of thing happened to trains. Some trains dawdle. They may say on the front that they are going to Euston, but once aboard you discover that they are in no great hurry to get there and that you will probably be pausing at Moreton-St-Davids for an hour or so while they load up the baggage car with sheep. What you need is a train that is meant expressly and exclusively for Euston, a train that does not stop anywhere else.These days express trains aren't very express and will probably terminate at Preston on a whim, but that's not how it once was, dear reader.And so a word that meant press out came to mean describe and intentional and specific and fast and non-stop.And espressos? Though an espresso should be drunk quickly and is probably expressive of something or other, the dwarf coffee owes its name to the original Latin. You see, the steam is pressed out through the coffee grains and into the bonsai cup.Like a cow expressing milk*By which I mean a coat of arms, not a marine mammal.

{"title": "Pisgah-Sight", "date": "Monday 3 January 2011", "text": "Moses led the chosen people to the Promised Land which flowed with milk and with honey and must therefore have been a rather sticky place. But God, keeping one eye on the OED, did not allow Moses to enter the Promised Land, only to glimpse it from a high promontory.I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.And from Moses' misery the English language gained the word Pisgah. A Pisgah-sight is a glimpse of something that can never be obtained. The phrase has been doing steady but slow business for four centuries now. Pisgah is eminently useful when describing window-shopping.Pisgah's advantage is that either you know about Pisgah and the Old Testament and understand the reference, or you hear syllables - Piss! Gah! - and get some sense of Moses' frustration. One can imagine him up on the mountain top cursing and swearing and wiping the Sinai sand from his feet.And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.Given that Moses is meant to have written the book of Deuteronomy, that last passage has always troubled the commentators. How, they ask, was Moses able to describe his own death? And what's that unto this day doing if it was written back in the day?The answer is, of course, that God dictated the book of Deuteronomy to Moses and Moses wrote down the story of his own death with the tears flowing down his face, and probably muttering \"Pisgah, pisgah, pisgah!\"The Bible does not record whether the sign was there at the timeFor Pisgah the OED cites a reference that refers to the OED's original editor, Sir James Murray who died before his dictionary could be published:Sir James Murray planned and led to within a Pisgah sight of completion a larger and more scientifically organized work of linguistic reference than Dr. Johnson could have produced.This is either James Murray or Moses; nobody is sure."},

I had also thought that it might be acceptable when passed round the section, but I didn't expect any takers for Shakespeare, intellectual snob that I was.

Three days later it had not been returned, and having exhausted Jerome and the magazines, I was making do with the Fourteenth Army newspaper, SEAC, famous for its little cartoon character, Professor Flitt, a jungle infantryman who commented memorably on the passing scene. And I was reading a verse by the paper's film criticI really do not care a heckFor handsome Mr Gregory Peck,But I would knock off work at fourTo see Miss Dorothy Lamourwhen Hutton loafed up and tossed Henry V down beside me and seated himself on the section grub-box. A silence followed, and I asked if he had liked it. He indicated the book.\"Was Shekspeer ivver in th'Army?\"I said that most scholars thought not, but there were blanks in his life, so it was possible that, like his friend Ben Jonson, he had served in the Low Countries, or even in Italy. Hutton shook his head.\"If 'e wesn't in th'Army, Ah'll stand tappin' [I'm a Dutchman]. 'E knaws too bloody much aboot it, man.\"This was fascinating. Hutton was a military hard case who had probably left school long before 14, and his speech and manner suggested that his normal and infrequent reading consisted of company orders and the sports headlines. But Shakespeare had talked to him across the centuries - admittedly on his own subject. I suggested hesitantly that the Bard might have picked up a good deal just from talking to military men; Hutton brushed the notion aside.\"Nivver! Ye knaw them three - Bates, an' them, talkin' afore the battle? Ye doan't get that frae lissenin' in pubs, son. Naw, 'e's bin theer.\" He gave me the hard, aggressive stare of the Cumbrian who is not to be contradicted. \"That's my opinion, any roads. An' them oothers - the Frenchman, the nawblemen, tryin' to kid on that they couldn't care less, w'en they're shittin' blue lights? Girraway! An' the Constable tekkin' the piss oot o' watsisname -\"\"The Dauphin.\"\"Aye.\" He shook his head in admiration. \"Naw, ye've 'eerd it a' afore - in different wurrds, like. Them fower officers, the Englishman an' the Scotsman an' the Irishman an' the Welshman - Ah mean, 'e's got their chat off, 'esn't 'e? Ye could tell w'ich wez w'ich, widoot bein' told. That Welsh booger!\" He laughed aloud, a thing he rarely did. \"Talk till the bloody coos coom yam, the Taffies!\" He frowned. \"Naw, Ah nivver rid owt be Shekspeer afore - Ah mean, ye 'ear the name, like...\" He shrugged eloquently. \"Mind, there's times Ah doan't knaw w'at th' 'ell 'e's talkin' aboot -\"\"You and me both,\" I said, wondering uneasily if there were more passages obscure to me than there were to him. He sat in for a moment and then misquoted (and I'm not sure that Shakespeare's version is better):\"There's nut many dies weel that dies in a battle. By Christ, 'e's reet theer. It's a good bit, that.\" He got up. \"Thanks for the lend on't, Jock.\"I said that if he'd liked it, he would like Henry IV, too. \"Falstaff's bloody funny, and you'd like Hotspur -\"\"'Ev ye got it?\"I apologised that I hadn't, and promised to write for it. By way of a trailer I told him as much as I remembered of Hotspur's \"When the fight is done\" speech, but I'm no Sean Connery, and although he nodded politely I could see I was a poor substitute for the written word.He went off, leaving me to reflect that I had learned something more about Henry V, and Shakespeare. In his own way Hutton was as expert a commentator as Dover Wilson or Peter Alexander; he was a lot closer to Bates and Court and Williams (and Captains Jamy and Fluellen) than they could ever hope to be. And I still wonder if Shakespeare was in the Army. Of course, by this rationale Shakespeare was also a king and, for that matter, an occasional woman. He would have been a prolific murderer and almost permanently suicidal. Some sort of allowance should, and never is, made for imagination. It's terribly unlikely that Shakespeare was in the army, or on the throne, or transgendered. However, his imagination was first rate.In particular, his was an imagination not easily seduced. His wars are as horrid as they are heroic. Even in Henry V, which has its bellicose moments, he maintained terror among the valour and horror in the heroics.I feel a trifle bad reproducing so much of a book, so run and buy it from Amazon here.Another family Christmas turns sour"},
{"title": "To Gruel", "date": "Monday 27 December 2010", "text": "Listening to a snatch of the cricket commentary last night, I was informed that the contest in Melbourne was gruelling. I confess that from my snowbound Cumbrian igloo I couldn't quite see how sunny Australia managed to gruel, but gruel it did.Gruel is one of those odd words, like ailing, that exists only as a participle. This should be not be so. Too few conversations go:Bill: How was the atmosphere at the party last night?Ben: Oh it gruelled.Bill: Really? Did it gruel an awful lot?Ben: More than I can say, old boy, more than I can say.Why is so much gruelling when so little gruels, and how does this all relate to broth?When gruel began its career as an English word, back in the fourteenth century it was content to simply mean flour. From there it began to mean soup made with flour, which was probably a lot tastier than it sounds. Here's a 1688 definition:Grewel, is a kind of Broth made only of Water, Grotes brused and Currans, some add Mace, sweet Herbs, Butter and Eggs and SugarDelicious. If the contest in Melbourne was so well spiced and so eggy, I am sure that the cricket would be wonderful. But this is not so, for gruel came to be part of a phrase, a phrase that can be best illustrated by this little snippet from the eleventh canto of Lord Byron's Don Juan. Juan has just been attacked by highwaymen on the way to London. He whips out a pistol and shoots the brigand and......Juan, who saw the moon's late minion bleedAs if his veins would pour out his existence,Stood calling out for bandages and lint,And wish'd he had been less hasty with his flint...But ere they could perform this pious duty,The dying man cried, \"Hold! I've got my gruel!Oh for a glass of max! We've miss'd our booty;Let me die where I am!\" And as the fuelOf life shrunk in his heart, and thick and sootyThe drops fell from his death-wound, and he drew illHis breath, -- he from his swelling throat untiedA kerchief, crying, \"Give Sal that!\" -- and died.To get your gruel is to get your just deserts, to take what's coming to you or, like a feral gardener, to make your bed and lie in it. And from this sense of gruel as a punishment, came the modern sense of a gruelling contest. Though I still can't see how Melbourne in December can gruel that much.Ricky Ponting asking for more referrals"},
{"title": "Boxing Day and the Perils of Poetry", "date": "Sunday 26 December 2010", "text": "Today is not boxing day.Once upon a time, there was a thing called a Christmas box. A Christmas box was a box with a small hole cut in it, like a piggy bank, through which coins could be dropped. It was kept in a church and, like a piggy bank, it could not be opened, only smashed. The smashing was done at Christmas, hence the name: Christmas box.Christmas boxes were used by servants, apprentices, bloggers and other impoverished fools to save up some money for the frosty and festive season. In gambling dens there would be a Christmas box of tips for the benefit of the butler. As one chap put it in 1634:It is a shame, for a rich Christian to be like a Christmas boxe, that receives all, and nothing can be got out, till it be broken in peeces.Anyway, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the idea of the Christmas box shifted. There were lots of chaps like postmen and milkmen and butchers' boys and bloggers who didn't have loose change to be stowing away all year. Yet they still felt they deserved a little something at Christmas. So generous Victorians would make a little box of presents which they would present to all the delivery boys on the first weekday after Christmas, thus insisteth the OED.The first weekday after Christmas therefore became known as Boxing Day. And today?Today is a Sunday.All those pleading postmen, beggarly bloggers and other assorted lazzaroni will arrive at your door on Monday morning, their usual truculence usurped by a poor smile and rich words. As Mr Weller remarks of his son's attempt at a Valentine's card in The Pickwick Papers:''Tain't in poetry, is it?' interposed his father.'No, no,' replied Sam.'Wery glad to hear it,' said Mr. Weller. 'Poetry's unnat'ral; no man ever talked poetry 'cept a beadle on boxin'-day, or Warren's blackin', or Rowland's oil, or some of them low fellows; never you let yourself down to talk poetry, my boy.'You have, dear poetic reader, been warned.(A beadle, by the way, was a sort of policeman paid for by the parish)."},
{"title": "The Feast of the Uncarnation", "date": "Saturday 25 December 2010", "text": "On matters spiritual, as on all others, the Inky Fool defers to Thomas Browne, and in particular to Pseudodoxia Epidemica [Popular Misconceptions, or Epidemic Wrong-Teaching]. For example, on the blazing question of Did Jesus Ever Laugh? Browne has this to say:The same conceit there passeth concerning our blessed Saviour, and is sometimes urged as an high example of gravity. And this is opinioned, because in holy Scripture it is recorded he sometimes wept, but never that he laughed. Which howsoever granted, it will be hard to conceive how he passed his yonger yeares and childhood without a smile; if as Divinity affirmeth, for the assurance of his humanity unto men, and the concealment of his Divinity from the devil, he passed this age like other children, and so proceeded until he evidenced the same. And surely herein no danger there is to affirm the act or performance of that, whereof we acknowledge the power and essential property; and whereby indeed he most nearly convinced the doubt of his humanity. Nor need we be afraid to ascribe that unto the incarnate Son, which sometimes is attributed unto the uncarnate Father; of whom it is said, He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh the wicked to scorn. Not only did Browne answer the question, but in doing so he invented the word uncarnate. This is a lesson to us all, dear reader. You can see how Browne worked. Browne wrote the incarnate son and then wanted to balance that with an adjective father. No fitting adjective existed that would balance incarnate both antithetically and syllabically, so he made one up.Just as carnal sins are sins of the flesh and carnivores are flesh-eaters so incarnate simply means made flesh and uncarnate means not made flesh. It's thus a terribly useful word that can refer to anything metaphysical and whose meaning is clear after an athomus of thought.So incarnations and uncarnations are expounded and explained, but what of flowery and petalled carnations?Carnation was originally just another word for incarnation: a fleshing out. But what colour is flesh? It's pink. (Well, for some of us it's pink. In my case it's a sallower shade of pale, and for others, I am reliably informed, it can be brown, yellow, red, or, in the case of daytime TV presenters, orange.)But let's stick to pink for a moment. Pink is the colour of flesh and therefore carnation came to mean pink, as in the death of Falstaff so sorrowfully described in Henry V:HostessNay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur'sbosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom. A' madea finer end and went away an it had been anychristom child; a' parted even just between twelveand one, even at the turning o' the tide: for afterI saw him fumble with the sheets and play withflowers and smile upon his fingers' ends, I knewthere was but one way; for his nose was as sharp asa pen, and a' babbled of green fields. 'How now,sir John!' quoth I 'what, man! be o' goodcheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three orfour times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him a'should not think of God; I hoped there was no needto trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. Soa' bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put myhand into the bed and felt them, and they were ascold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, andthey were as cold as any stone, and so upward andupward, and all was as cold as any stone.NymThey say he cried out of sack.HostessAy, that a' did.BardolphAnd of women.HostessNay, that a' did not.BoyYes, that a' did; and said they were devils incarnate.HostessA' could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour he never liked.And so from flesh to colour and from colour to flower, and that is why you may now wear a pink carnation.Mary showing Jesus a carnationFor an older post upon matters carnal click here."},

{"title": "Mortgage and Death", "date": "Tuesday 21 December 2010", "text": "Those landed readers who have invested in the property market will be unsurprised to discover that a mortgage is, literally, a pledge to the death. The idea is that a mortgage is a gage, or pledge, that can die in one of two ways. Either you pay the whole debt and the deal dies, or you can fail to make a payment and the deal dies and your house is repossessed and you are forced to live under a railway bridge exchanging amusing etymologies for crack.Or to put it another way:It seemeth that the cause why it is called mortgage is, for that it is doubtful whether the Feoffor will pay at the day limited such summe or not, and if he doth not pay, then the Land which is put in pledge vpon condition for the payment of the money, is taken from him for euer, and so dead to him vpon condition, etc. And if he doth pay the money, then the pledge is dead as to the Tenant, etc.   - Institutes of the Laws of England (1628)It's mortifying.Of the six surviving signatures of Shakespeare, two are on a mortgage. Shakespeare's views on such deals are amply displayed in sonnet 134, where he is complaining to his mistress about her having an affair with his best friend:So, now I have confess'd that he is thine, And I myself am mortgaged to thy will, Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine Thou wilt restore, to be my comfort still: But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free, For thou art covetous and he is kind; He learn'd but surety-like to write for me Under that bond that him as fast doth bind. The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take, Thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use, And sue a friend came debtor for my sake; So him I lose through my unkind abuse. Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me: He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.That, dear reader, if you can follow the metaphor, is some sub-prime loving.Mortgages were, at least, prettier then."},

However, by that time everybody will have stopped singing. So this post must go up five days before Jesus and Mary began their stable relationship, thus giving you five days to stride around sounding clever.I assume, dear reader, that if you love anybody truly you have been off spending your savings on partridges, turtle doves, French hens and the like. This is all right and proper, but don't whatever you do buy them a pear tree, four calling birds or five gold rings, for these are all linguistic illusions.Diligent and paleomnesiac readers of this blog will remember that the Old French for partridge was pertis (meaning fart) and the pear tree of the song is almost certainly a confused anglicisation of pertis to pear-tree.Similarly, there is no such thing as a calling bird; but a colly bird is a blackbird because colly (from coal) means black.Finally, the gold rings. I hope you have not already bought them, dear amorous reader, or that if you have you have kept the receipt.Let's have a look at the list for the first week, shall we?1) Partridge2) Turtledoves3) French hens4) Calling [colly=black] birds5) Gold rings6) Geese a-laying7) Swans a-swimmingAll birds. Notice the odd one out? Neither did I, for the gold rings are almost certainly ring-necked pheasants, or ring pheasants as they used to be called. The gold would be the colour of the wings, or perhaps the female plumage.Or the rings could be ring-bills, ring-birds, ring-blackbirds, ring-buntings, ring-dotterels, ring-pigeons, ring-plovers, ring-sparrows or ring-thrushes. There's a veritable aviary of birds that could be called rings and that, given the feathered context, is what the song is about.As an oven-ready pheasant costs four quid, you could have saved yourself a lot of money by consulting me before consulting the jeweller.Oven-ready, dear reader, oven-ready."},
{"title": "Antanaclasic Verse", "date": "Sunday 19 December 2010", "text": "There's a Chinese poem called Shi Shi Shi Shi Shi.

In Chinese the same word can have different meanings when pronounced at a different pitch.It's an exercise in what the ancient and rhetorical Greeks called antanaclasis, the repetition of a word in different senses. As Benjamin Franklin said: 'Your argument is sound. All sound.' Or Shakespeare's:Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,And will to boot, and will in over-plus...Make but my name thy love, and love that still,And then thou lovest me, for my name is will.(These verse are often ignored by the Shakespeare-was-all-written-by-Walter-Raleigh-dressed-as-Queen-Elizabeth brigade.)Shī Shì shí shī shǐ, put me to pondering whether it was a possible to write something slightly similar in English.

It relates, as you would expect, to beckon.So Wycliffe's Bible of 1382 gives Job 26v11 as:The pileris of heuene togidere quaken and dreden at his bek.Whereas the King James has:The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.The OED and other authorities say that beck was married to call in 1875. However, I've found hundreds of earlier examples and can trace the affair all the way back to the man who traced things all the way back: Archbishop Ussher.James Ussher was the fellow who worked out that the earth was created on October 23rd 4004 BC (a view that's now a trifle disputed); he also mentioned in a sermon of 1640* that:...but for the wicked God will use no such restraint: Satan shall use them at his pleasure: both in soul and body they shall follow him at his beck and call.And quite right too.P.S. Poor old Ussher comes in for a lot of stick these days from people who don't realise that his chronology was a brilliant work of scholarship that simply happened to use a different methodology to our own. Stephen Jay Gould wrote an essay on how clever Ussher was, which is collected in Ever Since Darwin. It's sort of on the Internet but in an awkward form. If you go to this page and click on p0009.htm, then go back and click on p0010 and so forth and so on, you can read the whole thing. Otherwise go and buy the book.*Published 1660 from the memory of the publishers. So the phrase may have been theirs not his.

Then I found that karaoke means empty orchestra and now I cannot hear those plaintive tuneless ululations without imagining the void among the violins, the emptiness filled only in remote repetitions.And the empty orchestra of karaoke therefore relates to the empty hand of karate.And manga, the darling of the spotted adolescent, seems pimpled by association until you find that manga means involuntary images, and that the term was popularised, if not coined, back in the 1814 by the great artist Hokusai, who painted the Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji, and the Great Wave Off Kanagawa.Yet we have not, dear occidental (and maybe accidental) reader, imported Japan's most delectable phrase: the nightingale floor. A nightingale floor, or uguisubari, is the creaky floorboard that sings as you tread upon in your noctivagant wanderings.

Thus did digits become numbers and when information is stored in numbers it becomes digital.The Old English names for the fingers are much more fun than those which have been more recently fangled.The index finger was once the towcher, or toucher, because it was used for touching things. We non-tactile moderns no longer use this finger for touching things and instead only point at, or indicate them. Hence index finger.Though you may, dear reader, run your inky index finger down the index of a book, that's not where the name comes from. Like a co-owned onion, they merely share a root.The index of a book indicates where a passage may be found (and the index expurgatorius indicates where the good, dirty stuff is). From this idea of indicating come all the other dull and dreary stock market and scientific indices.The dully-named middle finger was, to our forbears the fool's finger, but not, alas, because it was covered in ink. Instead we got the name from the Romans who called it the digitus infamis (infamous), obscenus (obscene), and impudicus (rude). Nobody is sure why the Romans bore such a grudge against the middle finger, but it seems that it was they who invented the habit of sticking it up at those they did not like.As Martial so delicately put it:Rideto multum qui te, Sextille, cinaedumdixerit et digitum porrigito mediumWhich translates extraordinarily loosely as:If you are called a poof don't pause or lingerBut laugh and show the chap your middle finger.What do leeches have to do with love? A leech is an old metonym for a doctor, and doctors are interested in the heart. Because it was believed that there was a nerve that ran from the fourth finger to the heart, doctors thought that they could influence the one through the other. Lovers believe that by putting a ring around the fourth finger they had, so to speak, lassoed the loved one's heart. And that's how the leech finger became the ring finger.And the little finger? It was called the ear-finger. Why? Because it's just the right size for digging wax from your shell-like.The Inky Fool consults the future"},

I am in the latter camp. Somehow I managed to get through three decades of life without noticing that cappuccinos - those caffeinated concoctions covered with froth and chocolate - must have something to do with Capuchin monks.They do. That light, creamy brown of a well-stirred cappuccino is the same as the light creamy brown of a well-hooded Capuchin's. Hence the name of the coffee.Capuchin itself is merely the diminutive of the Italian capuccio, which means hood. The Capuchins originally wore hoods to hide from the Pope; and by the time the Pope got bored and stopped searching for them, the monks had grown too attached to their little hoods to let them go. It had become, so to speak, a habit.Monks used to be the butt and target of medieval satire. People would write poems about them. You get some idea of their reputation from the fact that the first definite record of the word fuck comes from a fourteenth century poem about East-Anglian monks.Non sunt in celi quia fuccant uuiuys of heliWhich is a Latin-English mish-mash meaning:They are not in heavenWho fuck the wives of ElyMonks also wore brown and black.

So what do you call a monkey that looks like it's wearing a hood?That's right, dear reader, that's right. You call him a capuchin monkey.P.S. Incidentally, the idea for this post came to me when I was wandering around the Capuchin crypt in Rome, which is decorated entirely with the bones of dead monks [see picture]. It is without doubt the most screwed-up place I have ever been to, with the possible exception of Stranraer.*The OED says this is the most likely derivation."},

It is the same as a tatter-wallop, a ragabash, or a flabergudgion; and, given the threadbare state of modern fashion, it is an eminently useful word.Tatterdemalion should even be immediately comprehensible to the uninitiated because everybody knows what tatter means, and the demalion bit was never anything more than a linguistic fascinator.Tatterdemalion is a lovely word with a suggestion of dandelions towards the end (although it is pronounced with all the stress on the may of malion).More wonderfully still, there are spin off words: tatterdemalionism and tatterdemalionry. This latter word means all tatterdemalions. So, for example:The tatterdemalionry of Shoreditch cannot endure the glory of my silk scarf.Tell me that's not a useful phrase.Dress-down Friday at Inky Fool Mansions"},

King John wanted to renew his coronation, to which the Duke of Salisbury objected:Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,To guard a title that was rich before,To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,To throw a perfume on the violet,To smooth the ice, or add another hueUnto the rainbow, or with taper-lightTo seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.And by a strange, forgetful laziness, that line has been contracted to the phrase \"gild the lily\", which is not at all what Shakespeare meant.Lily-gilding might sound silly, but it would make a difference. Your lily would end up covered with gold, and might be rather pretty. Shakespeare talked of gilding gold, which wouldn't make any difference at all. Just as perfuming violets or smoothing ice is wasteful and ridiculous excess.The same objection might also be made to unnecessary nuptials.Jump forward a hundred years to 1697 and a tragedy by William Congreve was all, or at least most of the rage in London. It was called The Mourning Bride and opened with the line \"Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast\". It doesn't quite keep up that standard, but it's really Not Too Bad.There's a character in The Mourning Bride called Zara who's a bit of a bunny-boiler. She's in love with Osmyn, and doesn't realise that not only is Osmyn secretly married to a princess, but that he's not called Osmyn at all. Anyway, she discovers that he and the princess are all sighs and cuddles and decides to work their downfall, or more precisely to have Osmyn (not his real name) executed. She tells him in his prison cell:Vile and ingrate! too late thou shalt repentThe base injustice thou hast done my love:Yes, thou shalt know, spite of thy past distress,And all those ills which thou so long hast mourned;Heav'n has no rage, like love to hatred turned,Nor hell a fury, like a woman scorned.There isn't a hath in sight.So now you know. But in order that you should know I just had to sprint pell-mell through The Mourning Bride, which doesn't seem to have been printed since they turned f to s.

{"title": "Organic, Organised Organs", "date": "Thursday 9 December 2010", "text": "Organic food is food grown in a church organ. Organised crime is crime committed by organists.Well, etymologically speaking.Once upon a time, the ancient Greeks had the word organon which meant something you work with. An organon could be a tool, an implement, a musical instrument or a part of the body.Originally, an organ was any musical instrument, but in the ninth century people decided that every church should have a pipe organ in it for, as Dryden put it, \"What human voice can reach the sacred organ's praise?\"Slowly the pipe part got dropped and other instruments ceased to be organs (except the mouth organ, which, if you think about it, sounds a bit rude).Organ continued to mean part of the body, hence the old joke:Why did Bach have twenty children?Because he had no stops on his organ.Anyway, the body is beautifully and efficiently arranged (at least my body is). Each organ has a particular function. I have a hand to hold a glass, a mouth to drink with, a belly to fill, a liver to deal with the poison and so on and so forth. Heart, head, lungs, liver, kidney and colon each performs a particular task; and the result, dear reader, is the glory that is I.So if you arrange a group of people and give each one a particular job, you are making them act together like the organs of a body. You are organising them.Thus an organisation: something in which each person, like each organ of the body, has a particular task. And though that shift happened in the sixteenth century when everybody liked metaphors about the body politic, crime didn't get organised until 1929 in Chicago, which shows how lackadaisical most malefactors are.A bunch of organs put together make up an organism, and things that are produced by organisms are therefore organic. In the twentieth century, when artificial fertilisers were strewn upon our not-green-enough fields, we started to refer to organic farming and thus organic food.However, the church organ survives. If you add pipes to an instrument, you are organising it; and organ music can still be referred to as organic.A reluctant organ donor"},
{"title": "Christmas Trees and Peep-Shows in New Zealand", "date": "Wednesday 8 December 2010", "text": "Christmas trees, like Boney M. and spray-on condoms, were a German idea. Prince Albert brought the festive fir over to Victorian Britain. But as the OED puts it, it remains:a famous feature of Christmas celebration in Germany, frequently but imperfectly imitated in EnglandPrince Albert arrived in 1840 and by 1850 the Christmas tree was so well known that Charles Dickens could write a whole essay on the subject that began thus:I have been looking on, this evening, at a merry company of children assembled round that pretty German toy, a Christmas Tree. The tree was planted in the middle of a great round table, and towered high above their heads. It was brilliantly lighted by a multitude of little tapers; and everywhere sparkled and glittered with bright objects. There were rosy-cheeked dolls, hiding behind the green leaves; and there were real watches (with movable hands, at least, and an endless capacity of being wound up) dangling from innumerable twigs; there were French-polished tables, chairs, bedsteads, wardrobes, eight-day clocks, and various other articles of domestic furniture (wonderfully made, in tin, at Wolverhampton), perched among the boughs, as if in preparation for some fairy housekeeping; there were jolly, broad-faced little men, much more agreeable in appearance than many real men--and no wonder, for their heads took off, and showed them to be full of sugar-plums; there were fiddles and drums; there were tambourines, books, work-boxes, paint-boxes, sweetmeat-boxes, peep-show boxes, and all kinds of boxes; there were trinkets for the elder girls, far brighter than any grown-up gold and jewels; there were baskets and pincushions in all devices; there were guns, swords, and banners; there were witches standing in enchanted rings of pasteboard, to tell fortunes; there were teetotums, humming-tops, needle-cases, pen-wipers, smelling-bottles, conversation-cards, bouquet-holders; real fruit, made artificially dazzling with gold leaf; imitation apples, pears, and walnuts, crammed with surprises; in short, as a pretty child, before me, delightedly whispered to another pretty child, her bosom friend, \"There was everything, and more.\"What lovely lists! A teetotum, since you ask, is a spinning top with letters on its sides. And a peep-show box in that more innocent age was a box with a magnifying glass in the side through which you could see little painted wonders. In the twentieth century some bright and drooling spark had the idea of putting dirty pictures inside, and eventually somebody decided to shove a whole girl in there. This is called Progress.I'm not sure, but that child may, according to my dated Google Book search, have been the first person ever to utter the words everything and more*.In New Zealand a Christmas Tree is the English name for the pohutukawa, which flowers at this time of year and looks like this:*I'm excluding sentences like \"I hate everything, and more precisely I hate...\".

I have none. For had I a true friend, they would have told me of my errors, and comforted me with the word pectination. It derives from the Latin for comb, for reasons that may be guessed. Indeed, Thomas Browne exported the term straight from the words of Pliny.It's amazing to think that I have been pectinating all my life without ever knowing it: amazing and a trifle humbling. It's rather like the day that I discovered that I had a philtrum. I had always known that there was a little groove leading from my nose to my mouth, but had I been asked what it was called I would have panicked and answered \"Snot-wadi?\"(A wadi, dear reader, is an Arabic term for a desert riverbed that is only filled when there's a storm).Learning that that little groove above my lip was called a philtrum was therefore terribly reassuring. It's rather like finally discovering the name of the chap behind the counter in the grocery store (so long as he's not called Snot-Wadi).Browne continues his discourse on pectination thuslyly (veneficious means poisonous):The same conceit religiously possessed the Ancients, as is observable from Pliny. Poplites alternis genibus imponere nefas olim; and also from Athenæus, that it was an old veneficious practice, and Juno is made in this posture to hinder the delivery of Alcmæna. And therefore, as Pierius observeth, in the Medal of Julia Pia, the right hand of Venus was made extended with the inscription of Venus, Genetrix; for the complication or pectination of the fingers was an Hieroglyphick of impediment, as in that place he declareth.Not like that."},
{"title": "By And Large", "date": "Monday 6 December 2010", "text": "There are two ways that a sailing ship can sail. It can sail large, with the wind behind it and the sails bulging, bellying, billowing and ballooning. As Shakespeare put it:...we have laughed to see the sails conceive And grow big bellied with the wanton wind.Sailing large is, of course, the best way to sail. You shoot along fast and free, like an escaped man who is at large. Sailors would love to be large all the time, but they cannot. The exigencies of geography and meteorology occasionally force them to sail into the wind.Well, not straight into the wind. You can't do that. No amount of nautical bluff and saltiness can defeat firm physics. But you can, with skillful sails, sail very close to the wind. Within about 45 degrees of it. Sailors call this sailing by the wind. (If they sail straight into the wind then the ship comes to a sudden and shuddering stop. Sailors call this being taken aback.)So all the sailing ships upon the face and belly of the ocean are sailing either by or large. So the long and the short of it is that whichever way you look at it, considered from all points of view, by and large means considered from all points of view or whichever way you look at it.Well, it used to. It is in the nature of words for certainty that they lose their assurance with overuse. Man is a certain creature in an dubious world. So though by and large once meant under all circumstances it now means mostly. Just as probably once meant provably and soon meant now.The Inky Fool beats the tube strikeNow, if you have the time, I suggest you click on read more for the best passage about sailing ever written."},
{"title": "Paracelsus, Gnomes, Sylphs and the Rape of the Lock", "date": "Sunday 5 December 2010", "text": "Paracelsus was an alchemist, chemist, medic, and all-round egg-head of the sixteenth century. Paracelsus was not his real name of course: that would be ridiculous. His real name was Phillippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus Von Hohenheim. Paracelsus was a moniker he acquired for being the equal of the Roman writer Celsus.Why shed foolish ink for a chemist? Because, dear reader, Paracelsus invented words. Sometimes he invented words for things that existed: he named zinc zinc because it forms into jagged crystals and zinke is Old High German for sharp. Sometimes, though, he invented names for things that he had merely imagined. And, amazingly, they caught on.Gnomes, for example, are the children of Herr Von Hohenheim's imagination. There were no gnomes until Paracelsus dreamed them. He wrote a (serious) book describing them as being about a foot tall. He contended that just as fish move through water, and we through air, so gnomes can move through solid earth.It seems likely, therefore, that gnome would be a shortening of genomos (earth dweller) and the poor creatures have no etymological truck with gnomic utterances, which are wise.Paracelsus also invented sylphs. As gnomes are earth dwellers, so sylphs are spirits that of the air, and, according to him, are mortal but soulless, like Frenchmen. Nobody's sure where he got the name. It might be something to do with sylvan nymphs, but it might not, and Paracelsus is far too dead to answer questions.Both gnomes and sylphs arrived in our language through the absurd humour of the most quoted poet in history: Alexander Pope. The Rape of the Lock (aside from having a title that makes keys uncomfortable) is a mock epic about a pretty girl having a lock of her hair cut off. Like any good epic it needed a supernatural element, so Pope took up the absurd Paracelsian spirits and made them central to his story.Pope explains that sylphs are the spirits of women so vacuous and vain that they could not properly go to Heaven. Gnomes, on the other hand, are the spirits of prudish women, descended into the earth. The two camps fight futilely and invisibly around the heroine as she suffers her sly tonsure.Pope's work was so popular that the words gained currency in English. Sylphs had, occasionally, been mentioned before by Paracelsian fans, but the English language had never known a gnome before Pope wrote his poem.So, if it weren't for the combined efforts of Pope and Paracelsus, journalists would have no cliché to describe slim girls, and garden gnomes would not exist.Incidentally, garden gnomes commit suicide."},

Exorable pleaded for survival, but the gods of philology are inexorable, and said no.I may start a solitary campaign to bring back exorable, like those Siberian scientists who are always attempting to make mammoths out of amber. If a fellow knows what inexorable is, he ought to be able to work out exorable, or at least he should after a couple of minutes' head-scratching and brow-furrowing.

It's by a civil servant who believes in UFOs. He says:Like Fox Mulder, I was the rebel, the man from the corridors of power who wouldn't play by the same 'establishment' rules as everyone else.This blog is not concerned with aliens. I have nothing against aliens. Indeed, if our stony orb is under imminent threat of invasion, I want to be in with winning side. But this blog, and this blog-post, is concerned with the fatuous, imbecilic, snot-struck inverted commas that the author has put around the word 'establishment'.You put quotation marks, dear reader, around quotations. Is that too bloody complicated? And if you're quoting, I want to know who you're quoting. 'Who', as Hamlet asks, 'calls me villain?' But I read that whole damned preface and there wasn't a sniff of a whiff of a citation.Here are the 'possibilities':A) He wants to refer to the idea of the establishment, but at the same time imply that he is too clever to believe in the idea.B) He wants to refer to the establishment, but feels that the word itself is beneath him. His vocabulary is much better than that.If A - if the the idea is too simplistic for him - then why the hell is he referring to it? If B - if the word is beneath him - then where's the better one?If you are clever, be clever. If you are eloquent, be eloquent. Man cannot take a crap in inverted commas. You do, or you don't. If you have a better way of saying it, then say it better. If you have a more subtle understanding, demonstrate it. Do not send a bastard word to wander in this weary world and then deny its parentage.Using spurious inverted commas is like telling guests that you can cook wonderfully, but you've chosen to serve them swill. It would be rude if it were true, but nobody believes you anyway.Am I perhaps being too cruel to somebody whose aim was not linguistic felicity, but extra-terrestrial revelation? Okay. Here's the introduction to the Arden edition* of Othello:The analysis of Shakespeare's 'characters' has become unfashionable....Are they not characters? If they're not, and I'm prepared to believe that, what are they? If you know the secret, do bloody tell.This introduction... cannot simply ignore 'character criticism'.Is it not character criticism? If it's not, what is it? If you don't know the right word, stop writing until you do.I cannot help feeling [Try harder] that such contrary impressions are meant to intimate Othello's 'otherness'...Whose word is that? Yours? Why deny your own writing?A comparison of two other admired Othellos prompted a 'racial' observation...I read on (wearily), and it was racial. And here is the true fatuous, pretentious, aphasic imbecility of the whole introduction. Here is why it is unpardonable in academic writing:Bradley and his followers located 'the real Othello' in the first half of the play....Now I'm stuck, flummoxed and immerded. You see, this is an introduction to a Shakespeare play. It's full of quotations. But I can't tell whether the writer is quoting Bradley here, or simply resorting to his 'turd-brained', 'incoherent', 'semi-literate', 'lack-word' 'tic'.For that which we would write about, we must find a word: of the rest we must not write.*The Arden Second Series were the best editions of Shakespeare ever published. The Arden Third Series, or at least the ones I have read, are uniform tosh. Many of the annotations in this copy of Othello end in question marks. Some end in exclamation marks.

{"title": "The Etymology of Ranks", "date": "Tuesday 30 November 2010", "text": "The Antipodean wrote to ask why the army contains many majors and no minors. This ignores child soldiers, but is a good excuse for running from the bottom brass through to the top.The modern ranks were only arranged a few hundred years ago. This means that many of the etymologies make no sense at all. Heads outrank horse-servants, and biggers are smaller.A corporal has nothing to do with corporal punishment. He comes, via caporale and capo, from caput, the Latin for head*. This is odd as a corporal is the lowest and least of non-commissioned officers.A sergeant is simply a servant, and is therefore superior to the head.A lieu-tenant is simply French for a place-holder, or a substitute. The idea is that if I can't be present in person I can send a somebody to take my place and to act with my authority. American lieutenants are loo-tenants, because they're incontinent. English lieutenants are left-tenants, because they're all socialist. French lieutenants have women.A captain, like corporal, derives from the Latin caput, meaning head.Major is Latin for bigger. A major was originally a shortening of sergeant-major or bigger servant and his rank has been steadily rising. In Catch-22 a chap whose name is Major Major Major is promoted to the rank of major through an administrative error: thus becoming Major Major Major Major.A colonel is, literally, a colonnade. A colonnade is a line of columns and a colonel is the chap marching at the head of a column. In a nutshell, colonels have nothing to do with kernels, and there is no truth in them.Generals are, in general, the general head of the army. It is a shortening of captain general, which was formed along the same lines as attorney general and Estates General and other post-positive adjectives. Generals are therefore generic and genetic, ruling over a genus of soldiers.I have always wilfully misunderstood Hamlet's line about a play being \"caviar to the general\" as referring to a gourmandising soldier. The phrase actually means that, just as caviar is disliked by the general public, but loved by gourmets, so the play he refers to is unpopular with the hoi polloi, but appreciated by those who know about such things. I am certain that Shakespeare must have used the phrase himself, before giving it to Hamlet.Fields Marshals are not, etymologically, martial. Martial comes from Mars, the god of war and relates to martians. Marshals, on the other hand, are mare-skalkaz or horse-servants. Thus putting them, etymologically, below corporals, which shows how logical the army is. It also makes Marshall Ney's name even more amusing.And soldiers themselves: the word derives, as I have already mentioned, from salt. This means that, if you're an officer, you have salty privates.Incidentally, what do you get if you drop a grand piano on a barracks?A flat major.Now repeat with a pit-shaft.*Although some say that the reverse is true."},

But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said, Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life. And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and told, Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.   - Acts 5v18-23And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him. And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison. And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.   - Acts 12v4-10The phrase peter out goes back to Michigan in 1854 and a book called Puddleford Papers or Humors of the West, which contains the line:He hoped this 'spectable meeting warn't going to Peter-out.Without the out you can get back another nine years to the Wild West of Wisconsin.

There are four speculative theories.1) It's to do with St Peter denying Jesus three times.2) It's to do with a seam of rock in mining having been exhausted, because St Peter was the rock upon which Jesus would build his church.3) It's to do with the French word péter meaning fart, because péter dans la main is a French phrase meaning fart in the hand or come to nothing.4) It's to do with a seam of rock in mining having been exhausted, because it's all been blown away with explosive saltpeter, otherwise known as potassium nitrate.I don't think any of these work. Peter's denials seem irrelevant and his rockiness doesn't have anything to do with disappearance. The French word is pronounce pay-tay and is an odd intrusion into Midwestern English. Saltpetre, which is usually considered the most convincing, doesn't work because it implies explosion, whereas petering is always about quiet and inexplicable disappearance.However, anybody who knows the New Testament knows that St Peter is forever mysteriously disappearing. In a faintly Christian country, the twelfth chapter of Acts is all you need to explain Peter as a slang term for enigmatic escape, or silently slipping away.UPDATE I've just come across the verb to peter in a dictionary of London slang from 1860 where it means \"to run short, to give out\". As the earliest American version is only 1846, that means that well... I'm no longer convinced of the US origin.Can't a chap get some sleep?"},
{"title": "Loving St Catherine's Butterfly", "date": "Thursday 25 November 2010", "text": "Today is the commemoration of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, a fourth century lady who said that she would only marry a man who was prettier, posher, wealthier and wiser than she. She ended up being metaphorically and mystically married to Jesus and was then martyred by being broken on a wheel.She is therefore commemorated to this day as a firework.Being broken on a wheel was a nasty business. Essentially you were tied to a wheel and then smashed - in the thoroughly literally and rather painful sense of being hit with a club. After this, as an added extra, your mangled members could be woven between the spokes and then left as breakfast for the birds.The practice of letting the birds eat the dead is called a sky burial. It is also the completion of the famous phrase wear your heart on your sleeve. In the first scene of Othello, Iago mocks the impracticalities of honesty thus:For when my outward action doth demonstrateThe native act and figure of my heartIn compliment extern, 'tis not long afterBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeveFor daws to peck at.Daws are, of course, jackdaws.Anyway, to return to execution by wheel, it is a practice that is famously unnecessary for lepidopterists. Pope (the most quoted poet in English) pointed out that such a grisly and gruesome method of execution is needless when it comes to butterflies, and thus spawned a proverb. The butterfly Pope was talking about was John Hervey, a camp courtier to Queen Caroline, whom he nicknamed Sporus:Let Sporus tremble — \"What? that thing of silk,Sporus, that mere white curd of ass's milk?Satire or sense, alas! can Sporus feel?Who breaks a Butterfly upon a Wheel?\"Yet let me flap this Bug with gilded wings,This painted Child of Dirt that stinks and stings;Whose Buzz the Witty and the Fair annoys,Yet Wit ne'er tastes, and Beauty ne'er enjoys,So well-bred Spaniels civilly delightIn mumbling of the Game they dare not bite.Eternal Smiles his Emptiness betray,As shallow streams run dimpling all the way.Whether in florid Impotence he speaks,And, as the Prompter breathes, the Puppet squeaks;Or at the Ear of Eve [Queen Caroline], familiar Toad,Half Froth, half Venom, spits himself abroad,In Puns, or Politicks, or Tales, or Lyes,Or Spite, or Smut, or Rymes, or Blasphemies.His Wit all see-saw between that and this,Now high, now low, now Master up, now Miss,And he himself one vile Antithesis.Amphibious Thing! that acting either Part,The trifling Head, or the corrupted Heart!Fop at the Toilet, Flatt'rer at the Board,Now trips a Lady, and now struts a Lord.Eve's Tempter thus the Rabbins have exprest,A Cherub's face [see picture, above right], a Reptile all the rest;Beauty that shocks you, Parts that none will trust,Wit that can creep, and Pride that licks the dust.Hervey was not universally unpopular. Dr Johnson was so fond of Hervey's entire family that he once announced:Call a dog Hervey and I shall love him.N.B. Hervey is pronounced Harvey."},
{"title": "Miserable Biscuit-Whores", "date": "Wednesday 24 November 2010", "text": "Once upon a time there was a Hebrew word migdal meaning tower. On the shores of Galilee was a fishing village with a tower.  This village was called Magdala Nunayya, which is usually translated as Magdala of the Fishes, but could equally be rendered The Fishy Tower.From there, probably, came a lady called Mary from Magdalen. Mary was possessed by seven demons, until a chap called Jesus drove them all out and got crucified. Mary from Magdalen was present at the crucifixion and, by all accounts, was rather upset by it.In pictures of the crucifixion she is shown crying, weeping, lamenting and ululating. So much did she weep, and so often was she painted, that her name, without the G, became a byword for misery. And that is way sad people are maudlin to this day.The disappearing (and reappearing) G is also the reason that the Magdalen[e] Colleges Oxonian and Cantabrigian are both pronounced maudlin. And the people there are miserable.It's also the reason that girls named after Saint Mary Fishy-Tower are called Madeleine. One such girl was Madeleine Paulmier, who was a French pastry chef* and invented a kind of biscuit called a madeleine. Marcel Proust ate a madeleine and it reminded him of lost time and he went to live with a swan.Finally, Mary Fishtower's reputation took an nasty knock in 591, from which it has never recovered. Pope Gregory the Great gave a sermon in which he seems to have confused and compounded several different biblical ladies. He identified Mary Fishtower with the woman taken in adultery and therefore reckoned that she was a repentant prostitute. The confusion stuck and that is why Mary Magdalene is usually portrayed as voluptuous, if lachrymose, blonde. It is also the reason that Magdalenism means prostitution.All of which means that one could theoretically have a maudlin and magdalenic Madeline eating a madeleine.A typical day at Magdalene College*This is disputed, and the OED doubts her existence."},
{"title": "Saint Pants", "date": "Tuesday 23 November 2010", "text": "I think, by default, that my long-schemed week of saints is upon us. Now gaze, dear reader, upon my all-compassionate underwear.Once upon a time there was a chap who probably didn't exist and who probably wasn't called Pantaleon. Legend has it that he was personal physician to Emperor Maximinianus. When the emperor discovered his doctor was a Christian he got terribly upset and decreed that the doctor should die.The execution went badly. They tried to burn him alive, but the fire went out. They threw him into molten lead but it turned out to be cold. They lashed a stone to him and chucked him into the sea, but the stone floated. They threw him to wild beasts, which were tamed. They tried to hang him and the rope broke. They tried to chop his head off but the sword bent and he forgave the executioner.This last kindness was what earned the doctor the name Pantaleon, which means All-Compassionate.Anyway, in the end they got Pantaleon's head off and he died. By the tenth century he had become the patron saint of Venice. Pantalon therefore became a popular Venetian name and the Venetians themselves were often called the Pantaloni.Then in the sixteenth century came the Commedia Dell'Arte: short comic plays performed by travelling troupes and always involving the same stock characters like Harlequin and Scaramouch.Pantalone was the stereotypical Venetian. He was a merchant and a miser and a lustful old man, and he wore one-piece breeches, like Venetians did. These long breeches therefore became known as pantaloons. Pantaloons were shortened to pants and the English (though not the Americans) called their underwear underpants. Underpants were again shortened to pants, which is what I am now wearing.Pants are all-compassionate. Pants are saints. So think, dear reader, upon my martyred underwear.I've always liked the lines from Kubla Khan:And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,A mighty fountain momently was forced:Because I imagine the earth to be wearing thick pants. This etymology also means that Liar, liar, pants on fire is wrong, because they couldn't burn Pantaleon.History does not record and this mosaic does not reveal whether St Pantaleone wore pants.P.S. There's also a word pantaloonery, which means either fooling around like Pantalone, or the material used for making pants."},
{"title": "A Hymn To Sheila", "date": "Monday 22 November 2010", "text": "Today, as all Australians must be aware, is Sheila's Day. That is because Sheila is merely the Irish equivalent of Cecilia, which is the female equivalent of Cecil, which ultimately derives from the Latin caecus, which meant blind.Anyway, today is St Cecilia's day, and St Cecilia is the matron saint of music. Thus this day is devoted to the muses.Sheila (as I like to call her) only obtained this honour through a misunderstanding. She was a martyr of some sort in the second or third centuries, and an early account of her death said that she was stifled by being locked in her bathroom which was then overheated with air from red hot pipes, or candentibus organis. This seems to have been misread as cantatibus organis, which meant she was stifled while the organ played.Anyway, writing hymns to St Cecilia has been a standard poetical business for years. Poets must describe music, which is a lot harder than you think. You get some lovely lines, like these by Pope:Till, by degrees, remote and small,  The strains decay,  And melt away,  In a dying, dying fall. Or these from Auden:O dear white children casual as birds,Playing among the ruined languages,So small beside their large confusing words,So gay against the greater silencesOf dreadful things you did: O hang the head,Impetuous child with the tremendous brain,But the best are the closing lines of John Dryden's , which given his usual mediocrity is a miracle attributable only to the intervention of a saint.So when the last and dreadful hourThis crumbling pageant shall devour,The trumpet shall be heard on high,The dead shall live, the living die,And Music shall untune the sky.And here is the whole Auden poem set to music by Benjamin Britten.P.S. St Cecilia's body is, allegedly, in a church in Trastevere which I visited a couple of months ago. I would have knelt and prayed but somebody was playing the organ very, very badly, and it quite put me off."},
{"title": "Sonnet 21 and the Lost Original", "date": "Sunday 21 November 2010", "text": "Imagine, dear reader, that five hundred years from now all the James Bond films have been lost, but people are still watching Austin Powers.Sonnet 21 is not a good sonnet. In fact, it's a bad sonnet. I doubt you've ever noticed it. If you have read it, you probably moved straight on to Sonnet 22 without giving it another thought, and I wouldn't blame you if you did.But Sonnet 21 is quite peculiarly bad and it gets worse the more you look at it. Here it is in full. Afterwards I shall explain what's wrong with it. Then I shall give you my fantastic theory on why it's like that.So is it not with me as with that Muse, Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,Who heaven itself for ornament doth use And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,Making a couplement of proud compare With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare, That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.O! let me, true in love, but truly write, And then believe me, my love is as fairAs any mother's child, though not so bright As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:  Let them say more that like of hearsay well;  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.Many things are wrong with this sonnet: duplication of rhyme, inelegant repetition, tautology, faulty imagery, stupid words, pointless ambiguity and ill-matched lists. Let's take them one by one.Duplication of rhymeThe second quatrain goes air-ems-air-ems, and the third goes ite-air-ite-air. You can't do that. Shakespeare doesn't do that. In no other sonnet does he allow himself to repeat a rhyme, because it's awkward and it's lazy and it doesn't work.Inelegant RepetitionShakespeare repeats the phrase Heaven's air to no rhetorical purpose. It's fine to repeat a phrase for effect (We will fight them on the beaches. We will fight them in the fields.). But to do that you need to organise your repetitions; to repeat something without reason or structure is just sloppy.TautologyHeaven's air is a tautology. Where else would the air be? What else is heaven? Shakespeare was stupidly repeating a phrase that was already stupid.Faulty ImageryBoth lines involving Heaven's air have ill-formed metaphors. How can the air hem something? The image of a hem is taken from needlework. Heaven's tapestry might hem in a huge rondure, but heaven's tautologous air cannot.Nor is air a suitable material for fixing gold candles. The walls of creation might hold many candelabra, but heaven's air can't. Imagine trying to get the wall-plugs to stay in place.Contrary to popular belief, Shakespeare did not mix his metaphors: taking arms against a sea  is not a confusion, but a deliberate image of futility.Stupid WordsCouplement and rondure are both silly, latinate words. The word couplement does crop up in Love's Labours Lost, where it used by Don Adriano De Armado whose language is so hifalutin that he \"speaks not like a man of God's making\". Shakespeare knew couplement was ridiculous, rondure he just made up.Pointless AmbiguityPainted in the second line is odd. Does it refer to make-up, as is usual in Shakespeare? If so, the idea isn't taken any further. One would expect Shakespeare to go on about how his love is naturally beautiful, and the other's love is all cosmetics. Or is it to do with painting, as in art? It's ambiguous, but it's an ambiguity that adds nothing to the poem.Ill-Matched Lists\"With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems\" is not a proper group.Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best -Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow -That's a proper group: five parts of the body. Sun, moon, earth and stars would make a proper group: but in this line you switch from heavenly bodies to gems. Moreover, you do so awkwardly because the earth looks as though it fits with sun and moon, before you realise that it's the earth's gems that he's talking about. This one is really puzzling. It would be so easy for Shakespeare to have pulled out earth, air, fire, water or any other conventional group. Why this mismatched gallimaufry?So much for the problems. Here's one solution. Shakespeare was not writing about bad poetry in general. He was writing about one particular bad poem.That original poem would have these faults:1) Duplication of rhyme.2) The phrase heaven's air3) A misplaced needlework metaphor4) References to sun, moon, earth and sea's rich gems, April flowers etc.5) Preposterous praise6) Endless comparisons7) Long, fatuous, Latinate words8) Something to do with painting9) General awfulnessHow did this poem actually go? We don't know. It is lost, gone and vanished like an old oak table. But it is possible to reconstruct it. And, just for you, dear reader, I have done exactly that. Aren't I kind? Here is my (deliberately awful) original.I saw a portrait of my love today Yet, though the painter failed not in his art,A brush and human hand could not portray The image tapestried upon my heart.The sun itself cannot her brightness feign The pulchrous moon, beside her, is not fair.Sea-sapphires counterfeit her eyes in vain, Red rubies to her lips shall not compare.Frail Nature must within her confines keep And Art, unpotented, must mutely stare.The jealous stars must gaze on her and weep Those golden candles fixed in heaven’s air!  All tellings fade, like April’s first-born flowers;  Her beauty is beyond all earthly powers.Mr W.H. tells Will that he admires this monstrosity. Shakespeare, miffed, points out all of the faults and then, just to prove his point, writes this response:So is it not with me as with that Muse, Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,Who heaven itself for ornament doth use And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,Making a couplement of proud compare With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare, That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.O! let me, true in love, but truly write, And then believe me, my love is as fairAs any mother's child, though not so bright As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:  Let them say more that like of hearsay well;  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.It makes a lot more sense now, doesn't it? They are not faults, but parodies: not accidents but allusions. Nor am I merely being kind to dear old Will. You may have noticed that the standard against which I found fault was Shakespeare himself, and Shakespeare is unlikely to be worse than Shakespeare.As I say, imagine a future where James Bond has been forgotten, but Austin Powers survives.Could have been worse"},
{"title": "The Waters Of Life", "date": "Saturday 20 November 2010", "text": "The word whisky is not recorded before 1715, when it leapt into the lexicon with the sterling sentence \"Whiskie shall put our brains in a rage.\" Philologists, though, are reasonably agreed that it comes from the Gaelic* uisge beatha meaning water of life.Why? Because alcohol was already called aqua vitae in Latin. Alchemists, who were trying to turn base metal into gold, could find consolation for their failure in the fact that it's pretty damned easy to distil alcohol, which they called ardent spirits or aqua vitae.The principle and the translation were not taken up solely by drunken Scotsmen. The Scandinavians called their home-brew aquavit, and the French called their brandy eau de vie.However, the true water of life is a delightful euphemism for human urine. This should be drunk in moderation. Some say that it shouldn't be drunk at all, but urophagia is not to be sniffed at. Morarji Desai, who was Prime Minister of India, used to start every day by drinking the liquor brewed in his own internal distillery, which he always referred to as \"The water of life\". He said that Gandhi did the same. The Gandhi Institute denies this, although Mahatma's shrine was recently washed in cow-piss.*Not to be confused with a gay lick."},
{"title": "Mugwump", "date": "Friday 19 November 2010", "text": "A mugwump is a derogatory word for somebody in charge, or for somebody who affects to be above petty squabbles and faction. The plodding boss and the pompous peacemaker are both mugwumps.Mugwump is therefore an eminently useful word. It has a preposterous sound: the ug and the ump get across the idea of plodding stupidity, and context can give it meaning.The origin of the word is extraordinary and involves the first American Bible.There was a seventeenth century chap called John Eliot who was a protestant, a puritan and a colonist in America. He wanted to convert the local natives - the Wampanoags - to Christianity and to do so he needed a Bible in their language. He learnt Massachusett, the language of the Wampanoags, and then had to invent a writing system to get it down on paper. The result was Eliot's Massachusett Bible of 1663: the first Bible ever printed in America.Eliot had the perennial translator's problem of finding words for concepts that don't exist in a language. The Algonquians had no centurions, no captains, no generals and so what was he to do when such fellows cropped up in the Bible? He decided to translate all of them using the Wampanoag word for war leader: mugquomp.Mugwump then disappeared for a hundred and fifty years. There is neither citation nor quotation until the early nineteenth century when it pops up again as a comical and derisive term for a boss.So long is the silence, that some say that John Eliot's mugquomp has nothing to do with the nineteenth century mugwump. The OED avers that there is no reason to connect the two.I might believe the OED, were it not that the first modern mugwump it cites is from Vermont in 1828. Vermont is only just to the North of the Wampanoag homeland. This alone would test coincidence to the limit. The second citation is from Rhode Island in 1832 and Rhode Island is slap bang in the middle of Wampanoag territory. Had mugwump reappeared in California or Dorset, I might credit it as an independent coinage. But geography being what it is I am as certain as certain can be that mugwump is mugquomp, and that the first American Bible produced a fine American insult.We also know that the Wampanoag population of Martha's Vineyard were still using Eliot's Bible in the mid-eighteenth century. All of which means that the OED seems to be rather too exucontian in its derivations.So bring on the mugwumpery! Insult your boss and when a petty peacemaker belittles your battle, smack the mugwump in the face.And with that our tribal hebdomadary comes to end. As John Eliot said just before he died: \"Welcome joy!\"An editorial meeting at the Inky Fool officesP.S. I'm sure there's a Sgt Bilko episode where he bets on a horse called Mugwump, but I can't find it."},

His is a combination of art and interest that cannot be commended to too high an altitude.I remember once seeing a copy of Moby Dick, on the cover of which the illustrator had put a picture of a blue whale. It is a sad truth of illustrations that they are often drawn by people who care not a jot or tittle for the content of the book. Not so here. The chap, obviously, cares. Indeed his care may border on lunacy, but that's none of my business. The point is that this is not some fly-by-night illustrator knocking out a job in a week: it is a labour of love, a work of whimsy, and an opus of obsession.The relation of all this to December 25th?His work is now being published by Melville. It will be, I don't doubt, one of the finest editions of our times. Moreover, it can be given as a present to both children and adults: from cradle to care-home. Moreover, you don't even need to worry that the receptor of the gift might already have a copy: the point is that he doesn't have a copy with those lovely illustrations. I already own four editions of Snark, but am rabid for this one.Thus the problems of Christmas are solved with one fell swoop and swooping fall.Amazon UK linkAmazon US linkAnd the blog itself is here.Others, I'm sure can find it by going to Amazon and searching.Since you ask, dear reader, my favourite lines from the Snark are the following:He had brought a large map representing the sea,Without the least vestige of land:And the crew were much pleased when they found it to beA map they could all understand.\"What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators,Tropics, Zones and Meridian Lines?\"So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply\"They are merely conventional signs!\"\"Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!But we've got our Captain to thank:\"(So the crew would protest) \"that he's bought us the best --A perfect and absolute blank!\"Christmas with the Inky FoolN.B.

{"title": "Artesian Stella Behind The Arras", "date": "Thursday 18 November 2010", "text": "If it weren't for Hamlet, nobody would know what an arras is. Had the tapestry behind which Polonius hides been called a tapestry, then the word arras would have been tossed into the river of lexical Lethe and sunk silently into the world's oblivion.It is an arras because the town of Arras, in what's now north eastern France, was once a stronghold of embroidery, just as Chesterfield must be full of sofas, and Parma full of pigs. Arras was called Arras because it was the capital of Artois, from which must have come the Artois family. The scion of this noble line was Sebastian Artois, who, in 1708, became the master brewer of the Den Horen brewery. By 1717 he had got the brewery renamed in his honour. And the rest is, as they say, is lager: that unnecessarily sweet concoction known to the world as Stella Artois or Wife-Beater.Artois is a shortening of the post-classical Latin Artesiensis. If that word sounds familiar, it is the fault of monks digging holes.Carthusian monks in the lowlands of Artois (or Artesiensis, as it then was) would tunnel their way through the impervious rocks beneath them, until they came to the pervious rocks that were sodden with water. This water was being pushed down from the highlands but now, thanks to our in-habited friends, could spurt to the surface.Such Artesian wells became known as Artesian Wells.Artesian comes from the Latin Atrabatensis, which was itself just a variation of Atrabates. What was Atrabates? Wrong question! Who were the Atrabates? They were a tribe, a Gaulish tribe who fought Caesar and lost and did all sorts of other exciting things, but never expected that they would become wells, tapestries, and Bad Lager.Atrabates, incidentally, just means inhabitants. However, the Carthusian order does not admit ants.Hamlet steals the Inky Fools duvet"},
{"title": "Hooch and Moonshine", "date": "Wednesday 17 November 2010", "text": "Admiralty Island, off Alaska, is a big island teeming not, as the name might suggest, with admirals; but with bears. Sixteen hundred of the furry monsters* wander around being ursine, befouling the woods, and outnumbering the human population by a ratio of three to one. Admiralty Island was originally named Fortress of the Bears, or in the native Tlingit language: Xoots-noowu, anglicised to Hoochinoo.Anyway, in the eighteenth century a few europeans arrived there to trade furs (it was a bear market), and then in the late nineteenth century a lot of Europeans rushed over to search for gold. When they found that there wasn't any gold they cleverly decided to get drunk. This is where they hit upon the central problem of the whole island: a lamentable lack of liquor stores.So the natives hit upon the bright idea of brewing their own booze and selling it to the despondent gold-diggers. The health-giving properties of this moonshone homebrew can be deduced from this 1915 citation in the OED:They [the Chilcat tribe] were about to set out on an expedition to the Hootsenoos to collect blankets as indemnity or blood-money for the death of a Chilcat woman from drinking whiskey furnished by one of the Hootsenoo tribe.Yeah. That kind of whisky. The good kind.Anyhow, hoochinoo was a bit of a mouthful both literally and metaphorically, and had soon been shortened to hooch. And that, my child, is why we call cheap whisky hooch to this very day.Our thanks to the wonderful people of Bear Fortress was to give them smallpox.It should be noted that though a hoochie-mama may occasionally partake of hooch before engaging in hootchy-kootchy, the terms appear to be unrelated.Incidentally, moonshine is so-called because it is brewed illicitly by the light of the moon. Moonshine can also mean nonsense or a month. As the younger and bastard brother Edmund says  of his inheritance in King Lear:Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy lawMy services are bound. Wherefore should IStand in the plague of custom, and permitThe curiosity of nations to deprive me,For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshinesLag of my brother?Things the Inky Fool does when drunk*It should be noted that I don't mind our plantigrade brethren except when they insist on nudity.

Specifically, it is an ancient Tamil drum.Like eggs, carpets, and the England football team, it is in the nature of a drum that it should be beaten. In the festivals of Kerala and of Tamil Nadu such drums are beaten by members of a particular tribe and so that tribe was named the Paraiyar.The poor Paraiyar were considered to be unclean. The first mention of them in English comes from Samuel Purchas' Pilgrimes (1613) and reads:The Pareas are of worse esteem.... reputed worse than the Divell.In fact, the Paraiyar were considered to be beneath everybody except the washermen and the shoemakers (who were a load of cobblers*). So put upon and oppressed were the Paraiyar that, among the European invaders of India, they became a byword for outcasts. The Portuguese spelt the name Paria, and we, being British and fond of unnecessary 'H's called them Pariahs. Hence the word.English has now acquired the phrase pariah state which is thrown hither and thither like a befaeced tennis ball. But in fact, no Pariah state exists. The Paraiyar are alive and well, but have neither independence nor autonomy.   There was, though, a Pariah Poet.

{"title": "Carib Cannibals", "date": "Monday 15 November 2010", "text": "We shall now have a week of posts on tribes and the tremendous words that they have given to language. (Tribes are probably tribes because there were three (tri) tribes in ancient Rome).When Christopher Columbus arrived in Cuba he discovered that the natives called themselves Los de Caniba, he then sailed on to Haiti where they told him that they were called Caribes. This is because in the old Caribbean languages Ls, Ns and Rs were pretty much interchangeable (which must have been confusing if you were called Rory and ate lollies).One word - Caribs - survived as the name of a sea. Canib, with a bal on the end, survived as the designation of the culinary eccentricities found in those tropical climes; for the Caribs were anthropophagi.So that's the Ns and the Rs dealt with. But what (I hear you cry) of the Ls? Well, dear reader, that was a good question and well asked. Now can you think of a writer who set a play on an island? Can you? Can you think of the name of the savage character in that play? Can you? Well you damned well should, you bookless freak. Caliban in The Tempest.Ban! Ban! Ca-Caliban!Got a new master, get a new man.Yeah, him. So far as anybody can tell Shakespeare took the name from his reading on shipwrecks and exploration that formed the basis of the his last play.So Caribbean, Cannibal and Caliban all come from one word with an ambiguous consonant in the middle.Columbus was terribly pleased to hear that they were Canibs, because he assumed that the Canibs were subjects of the Great Khan, and therefore that he had succeeded in reaching Asia through the West. In this the poor chap was mistaken, but it shows the hope and foolishness that etymological speculation may engender.Now, like Othello, I have spoken......of the Cannibals that each other eat,The anthropophagi and men whose headsDo grow beneath their shoulders.Just on the offchance that you're interested, Othello is here alluding to the greatest travel book ever written: The Travels of Sir John Mandeville, which is a delightful filigree of fibs from the late fourteenth century. What's interesting about the Othello line is that Mandeville had been completely debunked a few years before Othello was written.Mandeville's Travels was a wonderful medieval fantasy that could not stand up to the cruel siege of truth. There was even a satirical play put on in London about how foolish Mandeville's stories were, just before Othello came out. So Shakespeare is deliberately associating Othello with a foolish, mythical and laughable past.Mandeville itself was partly based upon the Anglo Saxon Wonders of the East which contains this piece of information, which, like me, is more beautiful than true:Then there is a certain island in the Red Sea where there is a race of men called by us Donestre. they are shaped like soothsayers from the head down to the navel, and the other part is similar to a man's body. And they know all human languages. When they see a man of a foreign race, they call him and his fellows with the names of known men, and with lying words they deceive him and seize him. and then, after that, they devour all of him, except the head, and then they sit and weep over the head.The Donestre in an Anglo-Saxon manuscript"},
{"title": "Methinks", "date": "Sunday 14 November 2010", "text": "Methinks, does not have anything to do with thinking.The Old English had two verbs that sounded alike: thenkan and thinken. Here's the rub: thinken didn't mean think, but thenkan did, indeed that's where our word comes from.Thinken meant seem. This word has just about died out. It survives only in the phrase it seems to me or me thinken, now contracted to a single word: methinks.So the thirtieth most quoted line of poetry is: \"The lady doth protest too much, it seems to me\", as Shakespeare said of the suffragette.It's an odd little rule of English that we don't like the sound enk. You cannot wenk, lenk or senk, but you can wink, link and sink (and I often do). Such words may have existed, we always turn the E to an I.English grudgingly admits the enk sound occasionally, in such words as enclosure. Yet even there we confine enk to the unstressed syllable, and tend to pronounce it inklosure, as in Inky Fool.The Inky Fool was, of course, once known as Enki, and was worshipped by the Sumerians as their god of wisdom.

{"title": "Paradoxical Workers", "date": "Friday 12 November 2010", "text": "The first two words of the Daily Telegraph the other day were \"Unemployed workers\". The article then went on about the root and branch (but not trunk) reforms of the benefits system.I liked unemployed workers. I liked it for a lot of reasons. First, it is an oxymoron in the proper rhetorical sense. Like Shakespeare's:O heavy lightness! Serious vanity!Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms!Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!Or Bart Simpson's \"This sucks and blows at the same time.\" Or \"She's hot and she's cool\" or \"Military Intelligence\". In that sense it fits happily into the language of dating and love that I wrote about the other day.Second, there is the distant ancient voice of Marxism calling from the front page of the Telegraph. Workers of the world unite! To a convinced communist there are only workers and the bourgeoisie, just as in the eyes of God there are only sinners and saints. The notion that a worker is a worker whether he works or no has a long linguistic pedigree.And in a related sense, there is the idea of the working class: from the great triumvirate of upper, middle and... working. It is the euphemism denied by context: rather like tourist or economy class on an aeroplane. Finally, unemployed workers recalls that great paradox of identity. Is doing being, or being doing? Or, as Frank Sinatra put it: do-be-do-be-do-be-do.The famous French tosspot, Jean-Paul Sartre, observed that if you spend all day every day waiting tables, then it's no use claiming that you are, in reality, an artist. In reality you are a waiter. He denied an interior truth that might, like a potent dream, outdo the mere existence.And all that in two words. The Daily, Shakespearean, Marxist, airborne, anti-Sartrian Telegraph is one hell of a read.N.B. The phrase was confined to the print edition, which just goes to show that you should fork out hard cash if you want the gems."},
{"title": "Wagering the Wages of War", "date": "Thursday 11 November 2010", "text": "You can't really wage anything other than war. You can try, but it sounds rather odd. Indeed the phrase waging war gets stranger the more you look at it. A wage war should be similar to a pay dispute, or what job advertisements so euphemistically refer to as a competitive salary.There is a connection between all these different wages, and indeed to wagers. But you have to go back to the fourteenth century.A wage was, originally, a pledge or deposit. It was something given in security. From this wage you quite easily get to the modern wager: it is merely the stake, or deposit, thrown down by a gambler. It's also reasonably simple to see how money given in security could end up meaning money given as pay. And war? That's a trifle stranger. It involves trial by combat.In medieval law it was considered quite reasonable to settle a legal dispute by duelling to the death. Though somebody had to die, lawyers fees were, at least, kept to a minimum. In Latin that was vadiare duellum; in English you waged [pledged yourself to] battle.Not war. Battle. It was, after all, a technical legal term for the violent and slicing resolution of individual arguments. You wagered your body in mortal combat. However, it's easy to see how the sense of waging battle extended from the promise of violence to the act, and then expanded from the battle to the war.This last shift in meaning could reasonably be described as wage inflation.The Inky Fool solving a wage dispute"},
{"title": "Taliban Classes", "date": "Wednesday 10 November 2010", "text": "Taliban means students, but class means called to battle.Taliban means students. There's an Arabic word tālib, meaning student, and, if you make that into a Pashtun plural, you get taliban. This is because the Taliban were, originally, just a small group of religious students who wanted to clean up Kandahar. They then got carried away, as capering students often do, and invaded Kabul.Class, on the other hand, means those called to fight. There was a Proto Indo European word *kele, that meant, shout. From that the Romans got the verb calare, meaning call to arms. The early Roman population were always getting called to arms. When there were calared, the male population would form up as a c[a]lassis, and set off to find some Sabine women to rape.The Roman king Servius Tullius divided the Romans into six classes so that he could tax them more efficiently, and so classis then came to mean a group. A classis could still be a military group like an army or a fleet, in the same way that an English division can still be military. But class could just be a part of a whole. Thus a school or a society could be broken up into classes, and the animal kingdom could be classified.Incidentally, the reason that they are classified ads, is that they are arranged by subject, just as the Roman subjects were arranged for battle.The Inky Fool found cross-dressing was much less fun in Kabul"},

Can you see the root in encyclopedia, dear reader?You should. Even pig-ignorant Welsh vigilantes can see that root. Still no idea? Then you are not qualified to attack doctors in South Wales.Ten years ago, there was one of those flurries of interest in child molesters that so regularly beset our nation. Some right-thinking, high-minded, chaps in Newport quite reasonably decided to take matters into their own hairy hands when they discovered that nearby lived a paediatrician.They, quite correctly, realised that paediatrician (child doctor) derives from the same Greek root as paedophile (kiddy-fiddler) and, in a philological frenzy, ran down to the poor doctor's place and painted the word PAEDO on the front of her house.Quite right too. Or nearly right: technically the Greek for child is pais, and paedos is the genitive, but we'll let that slide. The important thing is that the mob should have taken the same direct action against, pedagogues, practisers of orthopaedics, and encyclopedia salesmen.I mean, if you're going to terrorise people on the basis of etymology, you might as well be thorough. I know I am.An encyclopedia is called an encyclop[a]edia because of the circle of learning that Greek children undertook. There is a circle (cyclos) of the liberal arts, and youth (paedos) is, in this case, synonymous with education.So where does all this leave that peculiar portmanteau and source of all truth: Wikipedia? Well wiki is the name of a simple method of making web-pages that can be edited by many users. It was designed to be simple and Very Fast and was therefore called wikiwikiweb. Wikiwiki means very fast. It is an intensifying reduplication of the Hawaiian word wiki, which means fast.And what does that mean? It means that the biggest website in the world is called FASTCHILD, and is about be destroyed by an angry mob from Newport.This also allows for the delightful possibility that somebody who is overly fond of Wikipedia is a wikipedophile. (Incidentally, wiki should be pronounced witi, that's how the Hawaiians do it).And the cyclops? A cyclops is a round-eye or cyclic-optic. So there is the cyclic connection, but there are, thank heaven, no children involved.N.B. Anybody insisting that the plural of cyclops is cyclopes will be hurled to an angry mob of Welsh vigilantes."},

This was shortened to Lombards, and so successful was the invasion that part of Italy is known to this day as Lombardy.Invasions, incursions, revolutions and risorgimenti have terrible consequences for undefended minorities and small businessmen (by which I mean men who run small businesses, not entrepreneurial dwarfs). History is written by the victors, not the barbers; yet we may be sure that such universal hairiness destroyed the incomes of the North Italian barbers, whose business it was to cut off barbas.The Italians probably deserved to be invaded, they had for centuries been invading others and spreading their Latin lexicon to the far corners of Europe. The conquered Iberians spent a thousand years licking their salted wounds and then set off across the Atlantic to continue the cycle of abuse*.They discovered a little island whose name, in the native language was Red Land With White Teeth; and, realising that this was a ridiculous moniker, decided to call it Beardypeople, which was much more fitting and sombre.Nobody is quite sure why they called it Beardypeople. Some say that the people had beards. Others say that this is ridiculous and that it was the trees that had beards (the Giant Bearded Fig grows there). Others again say that it was the reefs surrounding the island that had beards of foam.

{"title": "The Gangs of Turl Street", "date": "Tuesday 2 November 2010", "text": "Yesterday's Evening Standard had an article on \"The Secret World of Gang Slang\". It was full of the usual nonsense about the poetry of the street and asserted the spread of such slang was because \"black street culture is still seen by white middle-class kids as the epitome of cool\".However, it then gave a list of 31 slang words. The list included Butters and Tekkers, meaning ugly and technique respectively. One doesn't need to be a wild linguistic speculator to realise that butters is a shortening of butt ugly, technique to tekkers works on the same system; and this system is neither street, nor jafaican, nor linked umbilically to the rule of the knife. It comes from late nineteenth century Oxford.The Oxford -Er was identified by a linguist called Partridge in 1937. You take a word, shorten it, and add -er to the end. The Oxford -Er is the reason that we have rugger and soccer, which I have already written about here, the word having been invented by a degenerate poet.The Oxford -Er was then made famous by Evelyn Waugh and by P.G. Wodehouse. The knife-wielding thugs of Hackney are belated arrivals at the linguistic party. They probably got the idea from Test Match Special, listening to Blowers and Aggers and sharpening their shanks.If you want to know which way the language is heading, I should look to the lobby journalists of the House of Commons. Their names are all informally shortened to -ers, unless -ers doesn't fit, in which case they suffix -ington. So a name like Dawson, which can't be Oxfordised (Dawsers sounds odd) would become Dawsington.The lobby is at the top of a vertiginous toboggan-run of downward social mobility, so I fear that it is only a matter of time before the first stabbington.The Inky Fool pops to the shops"},

The underlying principle is, of course, that the more basic a word is, the less it changes. Highfalutin words, like, for example, highfalutin, tend to be much more mutable. The most central words are as unchanging as a tramp's pants.It is possible to write whole sentences that would have been understood in Anglo-Saxon times, more than a thousand years ago.

{"title": "Jane Austen and Latin", "date": "Monday 25 October 2010", "text": "Professor Kathryn Sutherland, who, through no fault of her own, is an academic at St Anne's College at the University of Oxford in the county of Oxfordshire, has, in a paper much reported in the national press, suggested, to the surprise and consternation of many, that Jane Austen, who has for so long been regarded as the mistress of English prose, may have relied more than a little upon the corrections of William Gifford, a classical scholar in the employment of John Murray who was her publisher, a translator of Juvenal, and an imitator of Persius.Christ, it's hard to write like Austen. Take the fourth sentence of Sense and Sensibility:But her death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it.Now let's cut away the subordinated stuff:Her death....produced a great alteration...for...he invited... the family The last seventeen words are apposite clauses relating to the possessor of the object of the second main clause. The extraordinary thing is that the prose is so readable, so lucid, despite being grammatically so distant from spoken English.English doesn't like to be complicated. It's a bluff, crude language that likes to stride around in a series of main clauses. The spoken equivalent of that sentence would be something like:She died ten years before he did. That changed things. He needed someone to replace her. So he invited Henry Dashwood's family to come and live with him. Dashwood was the legal inheritor...In fact, spoken English isn't quite like that because the sentences of spoken English rarely end. But if you replace all the full stops with and then you'll end up with something approaching normal conversation.As I say, it doesn't make sense in English, but it would in Latin. English likes to be simple because English has so few inflections. Unlike Latin (or German for that matter), you can't pin a suffix to the end of the word family to show how it relates to the main verb. This means that, in English, your grammar's complexity is your reader's confusion; unless you're very, very careful.However, as Latin prose was thought the model of good writing, and Latin language the palace of good thinking, its grammar crept into our literature, if not our language. Milton read all the classics, and wrote poetry that Ezra Pound denied was English at all. Thomas Browne knocked out jormungandrian sentences that nonetheless delight. Over breakfast, De Quincey used to improvise translations of the newspapers into Greek. Dr Johnson wrote a Latinate English that nobody ever spoke, but which was, when Austen began writing, considered the peak, pinnacle and pineapple of prose perfection.I always thought that that was where Miss Austen got her prose style. She imitated Dr Johnson and Dr Johnson imitated the Ancients and thus... well, thus that fourth sentence of Sense and Sensibility. But now I have a new suspect: William Gifford, possessor of a classical education, and the man to whom Austen's prose was entrusted.I have, though, not read Professor Sutherland's paper and can't find it online, so this must be taken as nothing more than the suspicions of a suspicious suspecter.N.B. I'm working on the basis that Jane Austen herself didn't know Latin. This is reasonably safe, as she once wrote in a letter that she didn't know Latin. However, some scholars think that she only pretended not to know Latin in order to avoid getting a job."},

{"title": "Red Pens And Acceleration", "date": "Friday 22 October 2010", "text": "People didn't stick their heads into ovens with the gas on, jump in front of subway trains or come plummeting like dead weights out of hotel windows with a whoosh!, accelerating at the rate of sixteen feet per second to land with a hideous plop! on the sidewalk and die disgustingly there in public like an alpaca sack full of hairy strawberry ice cream, bleeding, pink toes awry.   - Catch-22, Joseph HellerI was a proof reader once. Perhaps, dear reader, you have noticed all the typos that wriggle their way into this blog and think that I can't have been much of a proof reader. However, it is a truth universally acknowledged that it is impossible to proof your own writing. The writer remembers what he meant to write, and therefore sees what he meant to write. That's why people need proofers: proofers are other people.Anyway, I know how a proofer's mind works. I know the mistakes he is looking out for: the missing prepositions, the incorrect numbers, the words the words written twice. This last error is terribly common with writers who were distracted for a second and then continued to type.That's why I'm pretty sure that the mistake in the paragraph above is the fault not of Joseph Heller, but of some poor proofer who doesn't remember his physics....accelerating at the rate of sixteen feet per second....Your speed is measured in distance per time (e.g. 5 miles per hour). Your acceleration is measured in speed gained over a period of time (e.g. 20 mph per hour). If, dear suicidal, you jump out of a hotel window you will accelerate at sixteen feet per second per second.And the chap who proofs the coroner's report will tut and tush and take out his red pen and strike out the last two words.The proofer who adds a mistake to his text is, of course, going straight to hell, where he will be scribbled over in red by a hundred demons who will pluck missing commas from his nether-regions.A friend of mine once tipped his chair too far back, keeled over, and fell on his arse. Rather than looking foolish, though, he picked himself up, smiled and nodded sagely and muttered, almost to himself, as though recording the result of a successful experiment \"9.8 metres per second per second.\"Whenever you drop something, dear clumsy reader, it is an infinitely reusable line.About suffering they were never wrogn"},
{"title": "Fainéant", "date": "Thursday 21 October 2010", "text": "A fainéant is an idler and a sluggard. Somehow you can guess that without bothering to dig out your dictionary. Fainéants sound lazy. Why? Why, dear inactive reader, did you suspect immediately that a fainéant was a lazybones, a lie-a-bed, and a lotos-eater?Perhaps it was the suggestion of faint, with the éan slumbering redundantly in the middle. You pictured the poor fainéant so shocked by the threat of work that he had to go and lie down with some smelling salts and a good novel. Or perhaps you detected in fainéant a whisper, a suggestion, of fain. 'I would fain do that,' says the fainéant, 'but I have this terribly important pillow that I've promised to warm.'Both suggestions rest dreamily upon the word like a warm linguistic duvet. Then you see an older spelling and the etymology seems to spring out at you.Is there no difference [asked Samuel Ward in 1618] between busibodies and tell-clocks, between fac-totum and fay't neant?'Aha!' you think, believing yourself to have unravelled the fainéant's sleepy secrets. 'A fainéant is a fait neant, a French do-nothing! It is like the Italian dolce far niente: it is sweet to do nothing.' And with that you are satisfied and relapse into a deeper slumber.Yet still, dear reader, you are wrong: wrong because the French themselves were (as the French ever are) wrong. They thought that a fainéant was a fait neant because that's how it sounded to them. Yet the origin is hiding in a more ancient bedroom. A faignant, in Old French, was sluggard who feigned some excuse (French faindre) and feign relates to feint whose meaning meandered from lie to lazy to weak to faint, which means that, in a way, dear drowsy reader, you were right all along.The original fainéants were the rois fainéants, the French kings of the late Merovingian dynasty who did nothing at all and earned themselves marvellous monikers like Louis the Sluggard.Or as Catullus put it:Otium, Catulle, tibi molestum est;Otio exsultas nimiumque gestis;Otium et reges prius et beatasPerdidit urbes.Which translates very roughly as:Laziness shall be my end,Laziness, my dearest friend,Who wrecks without remorse or pityHonoured king and holy city.A busy day at Inky Fool mansions"},
{"title": "Long Sentences and the Sahelian Swahili", "date": "Wednesday 20 October 2010", "text": "Knowledge corrupts prose. You write upon subjects you know. Thus you can write a sentence that seems clear to you. You understand because you understood the ideas as you wrote it. Yet to the uninformed reader for whom you meant it, it is a belligerent mob of subordinated clauses, cavilling caveats and curious connectors.Take this sentence from an article I was just reading:As the longtime editor of the Socialist Register, Leys would probably not endorse this view, but a strong case can be made that just as it had been a mistake for supporters of communism who nonetheless opposed the Soviet Union, China, and Cuba to keep saying that not one of these actual communist regimes had lived up to the doctrine's emancipatory potential, so it is time to admit that there is only \"actually existing\" development, and that it has not worked.I can make neither head nor tail of that. I could try taking the sentence apart, but I'm not even sure how to. On my fifth reading of it, I decided that he had missed out a not. On my sixth I wasn't so sure. Now, I'm quite sure that the author knows what he means. He seems like a clever chap. But that is the problem. His expertise has got the better of his prose. Because he can understand the sentence he assumes that others will. Because he has a subtle and complex understanding, his prose is subtle and complex and cannot be understood at all.The simple solution would have been to break the sentence up. Eighty-one words is just too long, unless you're Milton. A full stop after view would be a start. I'm not sure how to continue because I still don't get the gist of the remaining sixty-six words.The understanding must be subtle, the prose simple: such is the paradox of informative writing.The article did, though, give me a word that I'd never heard before: sahelian. The Sahel is the strip of Africa immediately to the south of the Sahara. It comes from the Arabic sahil, meaning edge as it is the edge of the desert. The word is therefore terribly useful metaphorically. If I'm feeling pessimistic I could be feeling sahelian, with deserts of misery sweeping away before me. A chap who had just lost his job could receive a sahelian P45. An ambitious and verbose journalist could call today's Comprehensive Spending Review a sahelian moment.The plural of sahil is, for some reason best known to the Arabs, sawahil. That is why the inhabitants of the edges, or coasts, of East African are called the Swahili, or the coastal people. That does not mean that the Swahili (coastal) live in the Sahel (edge of the desert), only that their names come from the same source. After all, mad Welshmen aren't walnuts.Whereas the Swahili are opposite Madagascar"},

It is what is known these days as a retronym. There was a time when all trains were overground unless otherwise specified, but London is now so filled with metal worms sliding gracelessly beneath the city, that they need to tell you that this train is overground.It's the same principle by which we have a landline, organic food, or live music.Mind you, as the train has windows, you wouldn't think that the word was utterly necessary.Reasonably obviousP.S.

{"title": "Less Is More, Up Is Out", "date": "Monday 18 October 2010", "text": "R. Buckminster Fuller is often said to be the inventor of the geodesic dome and the motto Less is More. Neither are his. The geodesic dome was invented by Walther Bauersfield (Fuller obtained the patent) and the phrase less is more by Robert Browning in the poem Andrea Del Sarto: called \"The Faultless Painter\".Del Sarto was a renaissance painter who acquired the title Senza Errori because he was considered the most technically accomplished painter in Italy, but without inspiration, without a spark, without anything to say. He had wings and nowhere to fly to. Browning depicts him talking to his wife, Lucrezia, about his failure as she waits for her lover to arrive:I do what many dream of, all their lives,- Dream? strive to do, and agonize to do,And fail in doing. I could count twenty suchOn twice your fingers, and not leave this town,Who strive - you don't know how the others striveTo paint a little thing like that you smearedCarelessly passing with your robes afloat, -Yet do much less, so much less, Someone says(I know his name, no matter) - so much less!Well, less is more, Lucrezia: I am judged.There burns a truer light of God in them,In their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain,Heart, or whate'er else, than goes to promptThis low-pulsed forthright craftsman's hand of mine. Their works drop groundward, but themselves, I know,Reach many a time a heaven that's shut to me...Del Sarto's tragedy is that \"a man's reach should exceed his grasp\", although I don't know how original that line was to Browning. Anyway, it's a fantastic poem and you can read the whole thing here. There's also a lovely, and I'm sure deliberate, etymological joke about \"Such frank French eyes\".Buckminster Fuller never wrote a poem that good, but he did have a funny idea about banning the words up and down. You see the earth is (so modern science claims) round. So my up, would be an Australian's down*. Buckminster Fuller proposed using in and out, downstead. When you go up you go outward from the centre of the earth and when you go down you go inward. So he proposed going outstairs and instairs.This idea has a frivolity that I could find myself supporting, were it not that I fear it would cause unnecessary distress and confusion to those who are down and out.The Inky Fool wonders where he left his shirt*This will be significant during the Ashes."},

{"title": "Passing the Buck", "date": "Friday 15 October 2010", "text": "Fool that I am, I had always thought that the buck in passing the buck or the buck stops here was a dollar. Of course, when you think about it, that hardly makes sense. How would passing somebody a dollar shift responsibility? I probably thought that it was a dollar only because the elaphine alternative, that you were passing a male deer, was even less congruous. But that's etymologically closer.Bucks have horns. The horns can be chopped off (it's best to kill the buck first, or at least get it drunk). Why would you chop off a buck's horn? To make a beautiful knife handle, of course. And once you have your buckhorn knife you can use it to cut things, stab people or mark the dealer in a game of poker.The question of whose turn it is to deal is terribly important as the dealer can fiddle the cards, choose the form of poker, and has the advantage of placing the last bet. So in the saloons of the wild west and untamed Occident he needed to be clearly marked. This was done by stabbing a knife into the table in front of him. When his deal was done he would pass the buck(horn) to the next dealer.Here is Mark Twain describing a conversation between a priest and a \"rough\" in the 1860s:\"Are you the duck that runs the gospel-mill next door?\"\"Am I the-pardon me, I believe I do not understand?\"With another sigh and a half-sob, Scotty rejoined:\"Why you see we are in a bit of trouble, and the boys thought maybe you would give us a lift, if we'd tackle you - that is, if I've got the rights of it and you are the head clerk of the doxology-works next door.\"\"I am the shepherd in charge of the flock whose fold is next door.\"\"The which?\"\"The spiritual adviser of the little company of believers whose sanctuary adjoins these premises.\"Scotty scratched his head, reflected a moment, and then said:\"You ruther hold over me, pard. I reckon I can't call that hand. Ante and pass the buck.\"\"How? I beg pardon. What did I understand you to say?\"\"Well, you've ruther got the bulge on me. Or maybe we've both got the bulge somehow. You don't smoke me and I don't smoke you. You see, one of the boys has passed in his checks and we want to give him a good send-off, and so the thing I'm on now is to roust out somebody to jerk a little chin-music for us and waltz him through handsome.\"\"My friend, I seem to grow more and more bewildered. Your observations are wholly incomprehensible to me. Cannot you simplify them in some way? At first I thought perhaps I understood you, but I grope now. Would it not expedite matters if you restricted yourself to categorical statements of fact unencumbered with obstructing accumulations of metaphor and allegory?\"[In case you're wondering, Scotty's friend has died and he wants the priest to deliver the eulogy at the funeral]Anyway, a chap called Fred Canfil visited the warden of a prison in Oklahoma and saw a sign above the desk saying The Buck Stops Here. He liked it so much that he had a copy made and gave it to his boss Harry S. Truman who put it up in his office.Which leads us, dear reader, to one overwhelming question: what was Harry S. Truman's full name?I'll give you a clue: it's the same principle as Ulysses S. Grant and H. Norman Schwarzkopf."},
{"title": "Bad Sex With Martin Amis", "date": "Thursday 14 October 2010", "text": "Martin Amis correctly observes that sex scenes in novels are uniformly terrible. There is a Bad Sex Award given out each year by the Literary Review, but no good one. There is a good reason for this, which can be observed in the simple sentence:He got into his car and drove off.That sentence masks a hundred little actions. Were it fully written, it would go something like:He reached down and grasped the cold metal of the door handle that sat in the bright red paint of the car's side, with one firm tug it moved upwards and with that movement the door came open allowing him to climb into the L-shape of upholstery that was the driver's seat... etc etc etc he pressed his left foot down onto the clutch that gave way and, with his left hand he reached for the gear lever... etc etc etc'Yes,' thinks the reader, 'I know. That's how you get into a car and drive off.' A standard action requires no narration. It's nothing to do with whether the language is flowery or plain, good or bad. We do not describe the process of breathing in and out, nor the mechanics of opening the fridge. And sex is, unless you're the Marquis De Sade, a pretty standard business.In fact I should add a caveat at this point that if there is something astonishing about the sex then the novelist should of course describe it. But what is astonishing is never, or rarely, the sex.He got into his Batman costume and she started reciting A Season In Hell, and they had sex. Is enough. The sex itself is going to be a mechanical business. From the reader's point of view, it is everything else that is interesting: the lead-up, the aftermath, the wallpaper in the bedroom, all is going to be more interesting than the actual physical fandango.They had sex beneath the red patterned wallpaper. She giggled throughout.Anything but elaborate on that one phrasal verb.Of course, it's a terribly emotional business, sex, or so I've been told. And when something is terribly emotional it seems important. But I don't think that's the case. People get emotional about all sorts of things. Flags, for example, people get terribly emotional about their country's flag. But that does not mean that the Union Jack requires description. We know what it is, and that is that.Their mother had told them that if they had dirty thoughts they'd turn to stone, but they didn't listen."},

It exists almost entirely in the strange dialect spoken by journalists. Moreover, ail is almost always a participle. No recent British newspaper has used ail in the infinitive. Moreover, when ail does become an active verb, its meaning changes. Rather that suffering, it starts to mean harming. The reason for this is no doubt the phrase about curing what ails thee. Indeed, every ails that I could find in recent news was preceded by the word what, as in \"we want to get to the heart of what ails our schools\" (The Independent).So if you are ailed, you ail. Nobody in the news seems ever to have ailed actively, apart from an unfortunate Cumbrian chap who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease and observed \"I haven't ailed owt all my life, so it's just my turn to get something.'I will ail.

{"title": "Pantechnicon", "date": "Monday 11 October 2010", "text": "Once upon a time, 180 years ago, a shop was built in Belgravia, on Motcomb Street. It was a shop like no other, because it was going to sell everything. It displayed goods manufactured by all conceivable kinds of craftsmen: carpenters, potters, painters, sculptors, glassblowers, silversmiths, goldsmiths, blacksmiths and (I assume) whitesmiths.Then, as now (as ever shall be) a shop in Belgravia needed a fancy, filigreed, highfalutin name. So the Seth Smith brothers who had built it called it The Pantechnicon, which is Greek for Pertaining To All Of The Crafts, or Universally Crafty.The shop did not do well. After a while they converted it into a storage place for people who had nowhere to put their furniture. All over Victorian London the great horse-drawn wagons would trundle, taking beds, divans, sofas and seats to and from the Pantechnicon. As with modern moving vans they had the name of the company- Pantechnicon - painted on the side.The furniture storage business did very well until February 1874 when the Pantechnicon burnt to the ground. However, it had been around for long enough for the vast removal wagons to become universally known as pantechnicons. They were massive, twelve foot long and seven foot wide.Nothing is left of the Pantechnicon today but the facade, and a nearby pub of the same name. But it still survives in the language as the name for a large vehicle that is just outside my window.Not if you're American, though. I don't think Americans call them pantechnicons."},
{"title": "Saint Paul, Cleopatra, Shakespeare and Alliteration", "date": "Sunday 10 October 2010", "text": "As a little follow up to my previous post on Saint Paul. Saint Paul was born in Tarsus early in the first century. When he popped out into the world there would still have been people in the city who remembered the visit made by Cleopatra in 41 BC. Though, unlike Saint Paul, they would not realise that it was BC.Cleopatra had been summoned there by Mark Antony who wanted her to support his war against the Parthians who kept winning wars by unsportingly shooting arrows in retreat. These were Parthian shots.Anyway, the river Cydnus ran through Tarsus and Cleopatra insisted that she meet Antony by boat. Plutarch describes the meeting thus in Thomas North's translation of 1579:...she disdained to set forward otherwise but to take her barge in the river of Cydnus, the poop whereof was of gold, the sails of purple and the oars of silver, which kept stroke in rowing after the sound of the music of flutes, howboys, cithernes, viols, and such other instruments as they played upon in the barge.Sound familiar? It damned well should do, dear reader. Here's something from c. 1605.The barge she sat in like a burnished throne,Burned on the water: the poop was beaten gold;Purple the sails and so perfumed, thatThe winds were lovesick with them; the oars were silver,Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and madeThe water which they beat to follow faster,As amorous of their strokes.It's always great to watch Shakespeare at work, and the thing to notice here is how he cuts and elaborates on the basis of alliteration. The word barge is in the original, and Shakespeare adds that it was burnished and that it burned and that its gold was beaten. The poop and purple are in the original, so Shakespeare invents the idea that the sails were perfumed. Shakespeare picks the flute from among all Plutarch's instruments and then makes the water follow faster.You see the method?As I keep saying, Shakespeare was all technique.The Inky Fool realised he was on the wrong ferryN.B.

In honour of my new address, we shall have a little post about Saint Paul. Saul of Tarsus is responsible for one of the greatest passages in the English language, 1 Corinthians 13, and of course he gave us a couple of sayings like as you sow, so shall you reap (Gal 6v7) and the wages of sin is death (Rom 6v23). This latter statement is not accurate.Yet dear old Paul also gave us little linguistic morsels that we might never notice, because they aren't large enough to be a quotation at all. The first labour of love was that of the Thessalonians, for which Paul gave thanks in his letter. Paul was the first man to be all things to all men.To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.   Corinthians 9v22Paul was the first man to see people fallen from grace (Gal 5v4), the first to fight the good fight (1Tim 6v12), and the first powers that be did their being in Tyndale's translation of Romans 13v2.I'm not sure whether I'd get on with Paul. Wittgenstein said that the stream that had flowed so purely in the gospels seemed to have acquired froth in the epistles of the apostle. Somebody once told me that Paul had to be understood as a fallible and fallen man struggling to make a church out of a life. This may be so and I may be nothing more than Alexander the coppersmith. Paul's language may be chaotic and his grammar byzantine, as anybody who has tried to read him aloud will acknowledge. But when he was good he was divine, and he also gave the language a Damascene conversion.I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept my faith... The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpas, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.(2Tim 4)The Inky Fool moves inN.B.

{"title": "American Clothes", "date": "Tuesday 5 October 2010", "text": "I've been staying in the flat of an American friend and found amongst his books an American-English dictionary. It is a slim volume, almost bulimic, and it was first published in 1971.This antiquity makes it a curious book. It preserves the distinction between the American billion (a thousand million) and the British (a million million): a numerological nomenclature that we abandoned twenty or thirty years ago. I believe that in the City billions have been smaller since the sixties.Other terms testify to their times. I had no idea what a blackleg was, but imagine that in 1971 it was vital information for the travelling strike-breaker.Mainly, though, it shows the areas in which our languages have drifted apart. Every third word or so is to do with either cooking or clothes. Barrettes, bathrobes, bellpeppers, bobbie pins, broils, business suits, candy, cheesecloth, clothes pins, collar stays, cookies, corn starch, cream of wheat and so on and so forth are still absent from English English. I knew about three of them, but the rest are a complete surprise. Do Americans really call it a lima bean rather than a broad one? Astonishing. Do swedes really become rutabagas beyond the Atlantic storms?I suppose it's natural that these words should have drifted. Cooking is more talked about than communicated. It doesn't pop up much in films (movies) and novels in the way that serial killers do. Families have their own names for favourite dishes, so it is natural that a nation should as well.And all those clothes! It is permanently amusing to an Englishman that American men like to wear their pants, knickers, vests and suspenders on the outside. If I tried that I would be arrested. Again.What interests me about the clothes is that clothes do appear in novels. People are always being introduced as wearing a derby and jockey shorts, yet American novels have not affected English English. Why? I would guess that it is because clothes are almost never mentioned in films. On screen we can see what somebody has on (trousers and a tweed jacket) and no character needs to speak the words.It's an old streetwalker of a book: outdated but fun. I never knew that a robin was a different creature in America. However, the book misses my favourite difference.

It sounded as though the voice were trying to make lift number two the next lift, as though it were an imperative, as though Harry Potter were pointing his wand and willing that lift to come and get me.Lift number two shall be the next lift.In grammar, as in buttoning, nothing reveals more than a mistake. I think that my misunderstanding reveals something of the distinction between will and shall. Shall suggests what should happen, it expresses a human hope or order. Thou shalt not kill. If a weatherman were to say 'It shall rain tomorrow', it would sound wrong, because will or going to are used for such predictions. Similarly 'You will not kill' does not sound like a command, merely a statement of fact or murderous inadequacy.Anyway, Fortune smiles on the confused, because in speech we usually contract both words to 'll.The confused should follow this link."},
{"title": "Thomas Derrick, Jack Robinson and Dr Guillotin", "date": "Friday 1 October 2010", "text": "Once upon a time, hanging was the punishment for almost any crime. Even Ben Jonson, for the trivial offence of murder, was sentenced to death. The sentence was commuted when he proved that he could read and thus got Benefit of the Clergy. He had a T branded on his thumb and was sent home with a warning.The T stood for Tyburn, which is where the hangings used to take place. The man who would have executed Ben Jonson was called Thomas Derrick. Thomas Derrick was a nasty man. There hadn't been enough applicants for the role of executioner and so the Earl of Essex pardoned a rapist on condition that he would take on the job. That rapist was Derrick.Modern recruitment companies could learn a thing or two from the Earl of Essex.Which isn't to say that Derrick was technically bad. In fact, he was something of an innovator. Rather than just slinging the rope over the beam, he invented a complicated system of ropes and pulleys, and it was by this method that he, in 1601, executed the Earl of Essex.There's a moral in that, but I haven't the foggiest notion what it is and this is an counterethical post because Derrick's name survives. The rope system he invented started to be used for loading and unloading goods at the dock and that is why modern cranes still have a derrick.There are three main theories on why things happen before you can say Jack Robinson. The first is that Robinson used to be the French term for an umbrella (because of Robinson Crusoe), and that French servants were usually called Jaques. This meant that when rich Frenchmen visited England and were surprised by the inevitable rain they would shout \"Jaques, robinson.\"The second theory is that there was an eccentric fellow in early nineteenth century London who would walk out of parties without warning, often before you could even say his name, which was Jack Robinson. However, there is no contemporary evidence for his existence.The third and most plausible theory is that it comes from Sir John Robinson who was constable of the Tower of London from 1660 to 1679. He was therefore in charge of executions and was a stickler for efficiency rather than solemnity. The prisoner was marched out, put on the block and shortened without any opportunity for famous last words. He did not even have the time to appeal to the overseer by crying 'Jack Robinson.'So derricks and brief spans of time are both named after cruel and psychotic executioners. The guillotine, on the other hand, is named after a jolly nice chap.Dr Joseph-Ignace Guillotin had nothing whatsoever to do with the invention of the Guillotine. In fact, so far as anybody can tell, he was against the death penalty. Nobody's sure who designed the first modern guillotine, but it was built by a German harpsichord-maker called Tobias Schmidt.It was Guillotin's kindness that got the machine named after him. You see, in pre-revolution France poor people were hanged, whereas nobles had to the right to be executed, which was considered less painful (although I'm not sure how they worked that out). When the poor French were revolting, one of the key demands was the right to be beheaded. Dr Guillotin was on the committee for reforming executions. He decided that the mechanism with the blade was the least painful and most humane method available. He recommended it.In the debate that followed, on the first of December 1789, he made one silly remark: \"Avec ma machine, je vous fais sauter la tete d'un coup-doeil, et vous ne souffrez point.\" With my machine, I cut off your head in the twinkling of an eye, and you never feel it.It's a great line. People loved it. They composed a comic song about it. Here's an English translation:   Guillotin,   Politician,And physician,Bethought himself, 'tis plain,That hanging's not humane   Nor patriotic;And straightway showedA clever mode   To kill - without a pang-men;Which, void  of rope or stakes,Suppression makes   Of hangmen.'Twas thought, and not in vain,   That this slim   Hippocrates limbWas jealous to obtainThe exclusive right of killingBy quicker means than pilling.   The patriot keen,   Guillotin,The best advice to have   Before the next debate   Consults Coupe-teteChapetier and Barnave;      And then off-hand   His genius planned   That machineThat 'simply' kills - that's all -Which after him we call   'Guillotin.'So Thomas Derrick and Jack Robinson were both sadistic, heartless thugs, whose names live on in innocence, if not glory. Poor Dr Guillotin's family were so embarrassed that they had to change their name.There is, as the fellow remarked in the empty magistrates court, no justice.The Inky Fool catches forty winks"},

{"title": "The Twist In The Tail That Wagged The Dog", "date": "Tuesday 28 September 2010", "text": "Anton Chekhov once said:If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don't put it there.It's a fine rule: a rule of efficiency, a rule that says don't waste a detail and don't introduce a detail for no reason. However, it's a tricky rule to do well.Chekhov, on the whole, wrote serious and inevitable works. The gun that hangs upon the wall works well in such situations. It is a portent, a threat, a sword of Damocles and other clichés. The audience see the gun and guess that it will be fired. They are filled with fearful foreboding and that is just the sort of feeling that Chekhov liked to fill his audiences with.However, if, as a writer, you want the element of surprise, then the rule of Chekhov's gun is terribly frustrating. You have to have it there. You can't whip a gun out of nowhere in the last act. But tragic inevitability is only the alias of dull predictability. Of course the bloody gun is going to go off. No tension there.The writer of the story with a twist is caught between two failings. He must set up the twist: he must give the audience all the information that they need: he must indeed make the twist appear retrospectively inevitable. Yet he must make sure that the audience do not see the twist coming.A gunless first act would make the shooting of the second unsatisfying. A gunfilled first act must make it predictable.There are, so far as I can tell, three ways around this.First, you can introduce the gun and then stick it in a drawer. You pray to all the gods of narrative that people will forget about it until the drawer is reopened in the final scene, at which point they say 'Oh, of course!'.This can be done, but it's unlikely. The only way, I believe, that it can be carried off is if you then add in a bunch of unnecessary detail into the remainder of the first act in order to confuse them. There is a gun. It is put into a drawer. Then out come the dancing girls, the sword swallower, the talking elephant and the perpetual motion machine. When the gun is removed from the drawer the audience remember that they had forgotten it.However, this system breaks the Chekhov rule insofar as it requires unnecessary detail. Otherwise don't put it there. What are you now going to do with the dancing girls?The other method, and the neatest, is the double usage. Suppose that the story is about somebody facing bankruptcy. In the first act the blunderbuss is on the wall. In the second we discover that it is a valuable antique blunderbuss and that in its barrel is hidden a treasure map (if I were writing this we would only realise that after he'd shot himself. But that's because I'm a horrid person).The gun must fire. That much is inevitable and predictable, but guns can do so much else besides and that, dear tortuous reader, can provide the twist.N.B. You will no doubt have noticed that I have not provided a single example in this little essay. That's because I don't want to ruin anybody else's twists. I think, I hope, I forlornly pray, that my theory stands up on its own.The Inky Fool commits suicide"},
{"title": "Gamut", "date": "Monday 27 September 2010", "text": "About two thousand years ago a perfectly respectable lady called Elizabeth became pregnant and her husband lost his voice. He stayed silent as a silo until the child was born. The child was called John and when John grew up he began telling people that they were naughty and chucking them in a river. Now, if you or I tried a stunt like that we'd be brought up by the police pretty sharpish. But John got away with it and, if you can believe it, was considered rather holy for all his attempted drownings. Chaps at the time called him John the Baptist.Seven hundred years later somebody else lost his voice, or at least had a terribly sore throat. He was an Italian chap who went by the cumbersome moniker of Paul the Deacon so he wrote a verse prayer to John the Baptist that went thuslyly:Ut queant laxis   resonare fibrisMira gestorum  famuli tuorum,Solve polluti   labii reatum,Sancte Iohannes.[O let your sevants sing your wonders on,With loosened voice and sinless lips, St John.]Four hundred years later, somebody set this little poem to music. He wrote a pretty, climbing melody, in which each line started a note higher than the last, until with the words Sancte Iohannes it dropped again to the bottom.So the first note was on the syllable Ut, the one above was on the Re in Resonare, then Mi in Mira, Fa, So, La...The problem with Ut, though, is that it's a rather short syllable and difficult for a singer to hold. Try it. So it got changed to Do (perhaps for Dominus, but nobody's sure), and that gave do, re, mi, fa, so, la and, by extension, Si for Sancte Iohannes. Then somebody pointed out that there was already a So beginning with S and you couldn't rightly have two of them beginning with the same letter. So Si was changed it to Ti.Do re mi fa so la ti doWhich is just a shortening of a hymn to John the Baptist. The shortening technique was invented by a fellow called Guido of Arezzo.So poor Ut was consigned to history, or nearly. It sort of survives. You see the lowest note was also known as gamma, after the Greek letter. So the lowest note of the scale was once known as gamma or ut. Then a whole scale came to be known as gamma-ut. And that is why when you go through the whole scale, you still run through the gamut.Which means that this explanatory video is a damned lie.Julie Andrews singing the praise of John the Baptist"},

{"title": "Which John Milton?", "date": "Friday 24 September 2010", "text": "According to the news, a dirty poem has been discovered with John Milton's name attached. The poem runs:Have you not in a Chimney seenA Faggot which is moist and greenHow coyly it receives the HeatAnd at both ends do's weep and sweat?So fares it with a tender MaidWhen first upon her Back she's laidBut like dry wood th'experienced DameCracks and rejoices in the Flame.Though it comes from a 1709 collection of verses, not even Dr Batt, who found the poem, believes that it's by Milton. The working theory is that somebody attributed it to Milton in order to sully, smear and besmirch his reputation. That seems a trifle unlikely to me. By the standards of the late sixteenth century this isn't a particularly dirty rhyme. Certainly if your main aim was to traduce Milton by writing the muckiest rhyme you could imagine, you could have done something an awful lot saucier.It might be worth noting that John has always been one of the commonest Christian names in England, and Milton one of the commonest surnames. Any medieval chap from a town with a mill could acquire the moniker. Wikipedia has four John Miltons, Facebook two thousand.Faggot, of course, used to be a pejorative term for a woman, until in the early twentieth century the baton was passed to homosexuals. The poem is also quite neat in its misapplied words: in the first half the wood is, improbably, coy; and this is answered in the second half by the experienced dame's cracking (although at the time a fallen woman could be referred to as a crack).Milton was rather keen on rumpy-pumpy, but I don't think he would have made a joke about it.

{"title": "Uranus", "date": "Sunday 19 September 2010", "text": "The purpose of Uranus is, of course, to make me snigger. The planet was originally called Georgium Sidus - George's Star - after King George the Third. The name was then changed to Neptune, which, though it's less obviously patriotic, was still meant to celebrate the victories of the British over the revolting Americans. Then a compromise was suggested of Neptune George III, but it was, of course, a foreigner, and a German at that, called Johann Bode who proposed Uranus.You see, Mars is the son of Jupiter and Jupiter is the son of Saturn and Saturn is the son of Uranus (or Ouranos), so the solar system was allowed to progress like a divine family tree heading outward into the dark.Bode's suggestion was backed up by a German chemist who had just discovered a new element and decided to call it Uranium in order to make the name fashionable. To the delight of schoolboys all over the anglosphere, it worked.Uranus, in Greek, simply meant sky or heaven, the god being but a personification. This is the root of the lovely word Ouranophantor, one who reveals heavenly mysteries, and Uranomania, the belief that you are of divine descent.However, Uranian also used to mean homosexual. This was not because homosexuality might be heavenly, but to do with the birth of Aphrodite as recounted in Plato's Symposium. There are two accounts of the birth of Aphrodite, goddess of love. The first is that she was the daughter of Zeus and Dione, the second that she was the child of Uranus. In the latter case she would have no female parent, and so Plato took the story of Uranian descent to imply that love need not involve a woman.The term popped up in English in 1893 in the works of John Addington Symonds, who may have invented it. He wrote:Thou standest on this craggy cove,Live image of Uranian love.Uranian was Oscar Wilde's preferred term for his proclivities. In 1898 he wrote a letter to Robert Ross saying:To have altered my life would have been to have admitted that Uranian love is ignoble. I hold it to be noble - more noble than other forms.Symonds also called Uranian love l'amour de l'impossible - love of the impossible - whether he or Wilde delighted in the Uranian pun is not, alas, recorded.Oscar Wilde contemplating Uranus"},

{"title": "Wladyslaw Lach-Szyrma and the First Martian", "date": "Thursday 16 September 2010", "text": "According to Brewers the idea of Martians living on Mars was invented by H.G. Wells in 1898. According to Wikipedia the idea was popularised by Percival Lowell from 1893. However, both of these fellows are trumped, beaten and knocked into a cocked chronological hat by the Vicar of Newlyn St. Peter, Reverend Wladyslaw Lach Szyrma. He was, after all, the first person to use the noun Martian in Aleriel or A Voyage to Other Worlds published in 1883.Aleriel is a novel about an English vicar who meets a Venusian, who's on an incognito tour of the Solar System. The Venusian, Aleriel, describes Venus to him (it's rather like a long matins), and later sends him a letter describing the farther planets and a few of their moons. Aleriel lands his ether-car on Mars and:buried it in the snows, so that it might not be disturbed by any Martian who might come across it.And bam! The noun was in our language, as familiar to us now as those other great fictional creatures: the Australian and the American. Martians were originally like this:Under the forest shade, as we descended, we saw a figure half-human in aspect - erect and dignified - but gigantic in figure. His face was very like a man's and like ourselves, but yet he had a sort of lion look also in his limbs.We should be very scared of Martians. According to Rev. Lach-Szyrma, they are nine-foot tall, they're vegetarians, they're communists, and they speak Esperanto (or a Martian equivalent). I don't like them one little bit, though Lach-Szyrma thought they were super.They also live in triangular stone houses with conical metal roofs and have a lot of canals.Lach-Szyrma seems to have had terribly raw deal in the history of science fiction. There is almost nothing about him on the web*, and I had to go to the Rare Books department of the British Library to read Aleriel. This is odd because science fiction types tend to be a trifle fanatical about noting and archiving every detail of their genre.Though I disagree with Aleriel's politics and vegetarianism, the book is very pleasantly written and is such a turning point in the history of literature and of our conception of extraterrestrials that it should be in print in some sort of scholarly edition. Its prequel is now completely lost.It's strange to see a work that predates, essentially*, its own genre. Take this apologetic paragraph from the introduction:I have endeavoured to avoid as much as possible any conflict with established scientific discoveries; and, indeed, have based my speculations on the known facts of astronomy, only allowing the fancy to have free play where science is, and must be, unable, in its present state, to answer the questions here considered.Which is pretty much what science fiction is. Most of all, though, I like Lach-Szyrma. There's something cuddly about him, something so wildly hopeful yet politely apologetic. His imagination sailed the solar system in an ether-car, yet his body remained in the vicarage of Newlyn St Peter. When the Venusian describes the capital of Venus he says that it is beyond earthly comparison, but a bit like Edinburgh. The volcanoes of the moon are huge, terrifying and lifeless; but remind him of the Malvern Hills. The Venusian, who is of superhuman intelligence, believes that the strangest thing on earth is that so few people come to weekday services at the parish church.Poor Wladyslaw. His book is a voice from another world.I can't find a picture of Wladyslaw, so here is his father Krystyn, who was, of course, a Polish emigré. He was also a soldier, a philosopher and occasional author.*Somebody has started typing out a brief biography of him here, and then given up. I'd watch out, though, as the page looks hacked and may be virus-ridden.**I shall not be entering in to huge discussions of what the first science fiction novel is.

Monotremes are very odd mammals, if indeed they are mammals at all. The platypus is venomous (the poison comes out of a spur on its ankle) and can locate its dinner using electricity. They were also rumoured to lay eggs, but nobody was sure of this until 1884 when a naturalist called W.H.Caldwell found a platypus nest. He was terribly excited, but he was also in Australia and wanted to get the news back to a proper country as soon and as cheaply as possible so he sent a four word telegram:Monotremes oviparous, ovum meroblastic.Which means: platypuses lay eggs and within those eggs the young is formed from only a part of the yolk.Thirdly, one of the greatest poems in the English language was written about a platypus. It is by Lord Patrick Barrington and describes the dazzling career of a duck-billed platypus in the British Foreign Office. The first stanza runs thusly:I had a duck-billed platypus when I was up at Trinity,With whom I soon discovered a remarkable affinity.He used to live in lodgings with myself and Arthur Pervis,and we all went up together for the Diplomatic Service.I had a certain confidence, I own, in his ability,He mastered all the subjects with remarkable facility;And Purvis, though more dubious, agreed that was clever,But no one else imagined he had any chance whatever.And you can read the rest here.Finally, what do you get if you feed a mallard to a cat?A duck-filled fatty-puss."},

This proves what most literate readers have always suspected: that Harry Potter is nothing more than a thinly-veiled reworking of James Joyce's masterpiece.The word Hogwarts also pops up in the Molesworth books where it is the title of a play that Nigel writes in Latin, the script of which consists pretty much of the word Eheu, meaning alas.Of course, it's the second simplest thing in the world to look at the phacochoerus africanus, or warthog, and flip the name around in your head until it fits with hogwash. This has been done thrice: by Joyce in 1939, by Geoffrey Willans in 1953, and by J.K. Rowling in 1997.Just so you know: warthogs have funny, wartish protruberances on their faces, and hogwash is the kitchen leftovers that are fed to pigs.A much more peculiar question of priority comes from John Aislabie Denham, who was a folklorist in the first half of the nineteenth century. He wrote a list of mythical creatures that ran thus:...ghosts, boggles, bloody-bones, spirits, demons, ignis fatui, brownies, bugbears, blackdogs, spectres, shellycoats, scarecrows, witches, wizards, barguests, Robin-Goodfellows, hags, night-bats, scrags, breaknecks, fantasms, hobgoblins, hobhoulards, boggy-boes, dobbies, hob-thrusts, fetches, kelpies, warlocks, mock-beggars, mum-pokers, Jemmy-burties, urchins, satyrs, pans, fauns, sirens, tritons, centaurs, calcars, nymphs, imps, incubuses, spoorns, men-in-the-oak, hell-wains, fire-drakes, kit-a-can-sticks, Tom-a-Tuesdays, Elf-fires, Gyl-burnt-tales, knockers, elves, rawheads, Meg-with-the-Wads, old-shocks, ouphs, pad-foots, pixies, pictrees, giants, dwarfs, Tom-pokers, tutgots, snapdragons, sprets, spunks, conjurers, thurses, spurns, tantarrabobs, swaithes, tints, tod-lowries, Jack-in-the-Wads, mormos, changelings, redcaps, yeth-hounds, colt-pixies, Tom Thumbs, black-bugs, boggarts, scar-bugs, shag-foals, hodge-pochers, hob thrushes, bugs, bull-beggars, bygorns, bolls, caddies, bomen, brags, wraiths, waffs, flay-boggarts, fiends, gallytrots, imps, gytrashes, patches, hob-and-lanthorns, gringes, boguests, bonelesses, Peg-powlers, pucks, fays, kidnappers, gallybeggars, hudskins, nickers, madcaps, trolls, robinets, friars' lanthorns, silkies, cauld-lads, death-hearses, goblins, hob-headlesses, bugaboos, kows, or cowes, nickies, nacks necks, waiths, miffies, buckies, ghouls, sylphs, guests, swarths, freiths, freits, gy-carlins, Gyre-carling, pigmies, chittifaces, nixies, Jinny-burnt-tails, dudmen, hell-hounds, dopple-gangers, boggleboes, bogies, redmen, portunes, grants, hobbits, hobgoblins, brown-men, cowies, dunnies, wirrikows, alholdes, mannikins, follets, korreds, lubberkins, cluricauns, kobolds, leprechauns, kors, mares, korreds, puckles, korigans, sylvans, succubuses, blackmen, shadows, banshees, lian-hanshees, clabbernappers, Gabriel-hounds, mawkins, doubles, corpse lights or candles, scrats, mahounds, trows, gnomes, sprites, fates, fiends, sibyls, nicknevins, whitewomen, fairies, thrummy-caps, cutties, and nisses, and apparitions of every shape, make, form, fashion, kind and description...The odd thing is that that was published in 1859 and there is no evidence at all that Tolkien ever saw it. Hobbits don't appear anywhere else until John Ronald Reuel published The Hobbit, or There and Back Again in 1937.It's impossible to know what the hobbit that Denham recorded might have been. Presumably the hob is just a shortening for Robin, as in hobgoblin (which appears twice in the list). Robin and therefore Hob was a popular name with demons like Robin Goodfellow. However, the bit is lost to history. Perhaps it just meant small, in which case a hobbit would be a small demon, the infernal answer to a godling.Incidentally, if that list made you curious (and I recommend reading it through) Wikipedia has it up with lots of links here.Fiat justitia, ruat copyright!"},

But I read them so you don't have to.Anyway, when writing musicals the problem for Wodehouse was the performers. Actors may be cattle, but they are vicious cattle. Wodehouse had to accommodate the whims, vanities and contracts of the stars, starlets and gas giants of Broadway.\"Why don't I have any good lines in this scene?\" they would demand. \"I don't even go on in act two.\" \"I demand a huge emotional moment to display my roscian powers.\"One would imagine that poor Pelham Grenville would have been happy to get back to his novels and short stories. There, alone with his typewriter and his imagination, he would be free. But this was not the case.Wodehouse realised how right the actors were. You simply can't leave a character without a good line. You can't drop somebody half way through a story. Everybody needs a personality or tic. So he would make a point of imagining that he was writing for horrid, vain, demanding actors. He would try to foresee and forestall their complaints and vanities.And the result was the Blandings books and the Jeeves books and the Psmith books and that whole heap of wonderfulness that we read today.Often, Constraint is the doting mother of Invention, whilst Freedom sits among her squalid brood refusing even to change Drivel's nappy.Wodehouse arguing with an actor"},

I feel that Jedward and Jedwood justice, though etymologically unrelated, could usefully be brought together.Incidentally, Jedburgh is terribly important in the history of geology and therefore in the history of history. It was by studying the rock formations nearby that James Hutton worked out his idea of geological time. Geological time stretched the earth beyond the petty grasp of human history or human understanding.

{"title": "Heroines on Heroin", "date": "Friday 3 September 2010", "text": "Once upon a time cough medicines all contained morphine, and because morphine is a trifle addictive this was a problem. People were too worried to cure their coughs. They thought that it was better to hack a little than to become a junkie.So a German pharmaceutical company called Bayer decided to develop an alternative. They got out their primitive test tubes and rude retorts, and worked out a new chemical: diacetylmorphine, which they marketed as a \"non-addictive morphine substitute\". Like all new products it needed a name. Diacetylmorphine was all right if you were a scientist, but it wasn't going to work at the counter. They needed a name that would sell, a name that would make people say: \"Yes! I want to buy that product!\"So the marketing chaps decided to call it Heroin, because apparently it made you feel heroic. And guess what? It did sell.Heroin remained a Bayer trademark until the First World War; but the \"non-addictive\" part turned out to be a trifle misguided.And that's why heroines are connected to heroin. Incidentally, the adjective for a heroine is heroinal (as distinct from the unisex heroic). Heroinal, though, has been used only once, in 1652, by Sir Thomas Urqhart who wrote the words:Her mellifluent and heroinal breast...Oh, and if you are ever offered \"heroic measures\" in hospital, it does not mean that you're going to have a tall, dashing doctor.

They are characteristic of classical Athenian architecture and Athens was the capital of Attica.The technical term for a small section at the top of a temple then became a jocular term for the small space above a house. The word was first used in this sense by Daniel Defoe in his Tour of Great Britain, in which he also described Hampstead (which I am leaving) thus:But it must be confest, 'tis so near heaven, that I dare not say it can be a proper situation, for any but a race of mountaineers...Attics should be used for storing mad women and cash.Garrets (which originally meant watchtowers) should be used for storing artists.The Inky Fool leaving Hampstead"},

They invaded Gaul and Gaul became Franc[k]e.They oppressed the native Gauls horribly, forcing them to eat garlic and listen to Johnny Hallyday records. Only the Franks were free. Thus they were enfranchised. They were able to speak freely, or frankly, and everybody else was disenfranchised and not able to approve things just by franking them.How did the Franks get to France? Well, on the way they had to cross the river Main. This was easily done: they found a ford by which to ford it. The place became known as Frank-ford on the Main, or Frankfurt am Main.Frankfurt is now best known as a financial centre, but also makes lots of low-rent sausages called Frankfurters. By the same token a hamburger comes from Hamburg* and involves no ham (or in the case of McDonalds no detectable meat at all). Also a berliner is a kind of doughnut from Berlin, which made JFK's famous remark - 'I am a Berliner' - a trifle amusing to German audiences (that is, until they elected Chancellor Cabbage).In France the big export used to be incense, which therefore became known as frankincense, and at least one of the Franks managed to cross the Atlantic still bearing his name of \"Son of the South freeborn landowner\", which translates to Benjamin Franklin.*Probably."},

I fear that many people may read Shakespeare's line and imagine that there are rough winds during May shaking the buds. I'm pretty sure that that is not the case. The point of the line is that the flowers that were buds are being shaken by the rough winds of Autumn. Thus:Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,And summer's lease hath all too short a date.There's something lovely about the end being seen in the beginning and the beginning being seen in the end. Auden wrote:Time and beauty burn awayIndividual beauty fromThoughtful children and the graveProves the child ephemeral.Which does approximately the same thing.

{"title": "Spangled Drinking Songs", "date": "Friday 20 August 2010", "text": "A spangle is, of course, a little spang: a spang being a small, glittering ornament. To be spangled is to be covered in small spangs, a fate that befalls the best of us at times.I came across spangled in a work by Thomas Moore - not the famous one, you understand, but the nineteenth century Irish poetaster. He wrote:   As late I sought the spangled bowers   To cull a wreath of matin flowers,It was one of his translations from the Greek poet Anacreon. Anacreon was an ancient boozer and lover and lyric poet. His poems (anacreontics) are about getting drunk and making lyrical, Attic love (by which I mean Greek love, not sex in a garret*). Anacreon was therefore a Good Thing.Anacreon was, indeed, such a good thing that in the eighteenth century an English gentleman's club was founded in his memory. It was called the Anacreontic Society and was devoted to \"wit, harmony and the god of wine\". It was a very musical affair and two members wrote a society drinking song called \"To Anacreon in Heaven\". John Stafford Smith wrote the tune and the society's president, Ralph Tomlinson wrote the words. The first verse went thuslyly:To Anacreon in Heav'n, where he sat in full gleeA few sons of harmony sent a petition,That he their inspirer and patron would beWhen this answer arrived from the jolly old Grecian\"Voice, fiddle, and flute,No longer be mute,I'll lend you my name and inspire you to boot,And, besides, I'll instruct you like me to intwineThe myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine.\" Bacchus's vine is, of course, booze. It was a good song and became rather popular. Because it was hard to sing, it became an ad hoc test of drunkenness used by the Enlightenment police. If you could sing To Anacreon in Heaven in tune you were sober and free to go. This is, if you think about it, an odd fate for a drinking song.Unfortunately it was so popular that it was usurped and stolen by a chap called Francis Scott Key who wrote new words that weren't about drink but about being able to see a flag flying after a bombardment. His words went: O say can you see by the dawn's early lightWhat so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming.And the rockets' red glare,The bombs bursting in air.Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;O, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave,O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? And the new title that he gave to an old drinking song takes us straight back to Small Spangs.*There was a young man from PeruWho had nothing whatever to do:So he ran to the garretAnd buggered the parrot,And sent the result to a zoo."},

Necrocracy is not in the OED, although it's easy to work out that it means government by the dead (a bit like G.K. Chesterton's dictum that 'tradition is the democracy of the dead').Though there's no necrocracy, there are an awful lot of necro-words in the dictionary. My favourite is necropolitan, which relates to necropolis as metropolitan relates to metropolis. A necropolis is a city of the dead, or in other words: a large graveyard.This makes more sense if you live in a country that's keen on tombs. Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris (pictured) looks and feels like a neat little town. Once expects to see a postman.So necropolitan means graveyardish. The word is, of course, preposterously periphrastic, but sesquipedalianism can be charming.

Those who are not your kith are unkith, and therefore uncouth, which originally meant unknown.Uncouth comes, it seems, from cuð, which gave the Old English wīfcȳþþe, which meant woman-knowledge, which meant rumpy-pumpy. But now uncouth survives as a fossil word like gormless, feckless, ruthless and reckless, on which I have already blogged.However, according to the dictionary, couth has survived in Scotland (although I don't see why anything would want to do that). In those cold, hyperborean, whisky-sodden glens couth's meaning has moved from known to familiar to snug and cosy."},

These rules have been broken a few times at our discretion. P.S. Google is sometimes eccentric on the number of hits, which can vary by clicking refresh. This is because it keeps adjusting to deal with spam and people trying to fool Google in to high rankings for their page. So sometimes it does odd things with line-breaks or even gives more results when there are more words in the search, which is utterly illogical. They also seem to vary slightly by country. Robert Frost's lines dipped slightly (or I noted them down incorrectly). The final arbiter has to be what pops up on my screen when I try the line in inverted commas."},
{"title": "Auden and Schwarzenegger: The Hunter Becomes the Hunted!", "date": "Saturday 14 August 2010", "text": "A plunderer is somebody who takes plunder. Words are often their own victims, and perforce prey on themselves like monsters of the deep. Once such word is prey.Once upon a toga-clad time, you prehended things, meaning that you got them: hence apprehend, comprehend and reprehensible. Pr(a)ehend then turned into Latin praeda, meaning something that was got, usually plunder. From praeda, via French, we got prey.From praeda too, the Romans got praedari, meaning to plunder, and from that the English got predation, and from that you got predatory and then finally, in 1908*, you got predator.And thus the hunter is, etymologically, also the hunted. And thus we are off to the jungles of South America and a crack team of special forces running for their lives and pondering their political careers (two of the actors later became state governors and a third ran unsuccessfully for the governorship of Kentucky).Anyway, watching Predator I am always reminded of Auden's revisions of his own poetry. It's hard to say what the greatest line in the film is, but one of them is:There's something out there waiting for us, and it ain't no man. We're all going to die.Auden once wrote a poem called September 1st 1939 (scholars aren't sure when). It climaxes with this stanza:All I have is a voiceTo undo the folded lie,The romantic lie in the brainOf the sensual man-in-the-street And the lie of AuthorityWhose buildings grope the sky: There is no such thing as the State And no one exists alone;Hunger allows no choiceTo the citizen or the police;We must love one another or die.He then decided that that last line didn't work. We die anyway, whether we love or not. All men are mortal (and most women). So he changed it to \"We must love one another and die.\" But that hardly means anything. You might as well say \"We must remember to feed the cat and die\". He therefore decided to scrap the whole poem. He suppressed it. It is therefore still omitted from many, many editions of Auden's complete poetry, much to the bewilderment of readers.The same, of course, applies to \"There's something out there waiting for us, and it ain't no man. We're all going to die.\" Well, of course you're all going to die: all that lives must die, passing through nature to eternity.That, I think, concludes our week of eighties action movies. I simply can't work out why Rambo is named after a French poet and it's not that interesting that commando was first used in English by Winston Churchill. The old action stars are gone. The golden age has turned to bronze. The stars have gone out one by one (or been cast in The Expendables) and now, as Auden said of Arnold in the same poem:...helpless governors wakeTo resume their compulsory game: Who can release them now,Who can reach the dead,Who can speak for the dumb?Whatever is out there, it killed Hopper, and now it wants us.*There is a lone citation from 1581, but it seems to have been a Latin pun and didn't catch on."},

{"title": "Robocop: The Feudal Getter", "date": "Thursday 12 August 2010", "text": "Once upon a time in central Europe there were lords and peasants. The lords owned all the land but peasants were granted portions of it for themselves. The peasant would then work his own little plot and the lord's. The bigger the peasant's plot, the longer he had to work the fields of the lord who had granted it to him.This system, abolished by Emperor Josef II (right) in 1848, was called robot.The system was abolished, but the word of course survived. 72 years later, in 1920, a Czech fellow called Karel Čapek was writing a play. It was about a factory that would produced willing servants out of biological matter. Mr Čapek decided to use the Latin root labor (that gives us labour) and call these servants labori.And that would have been that were it not for his brother Josef, who suggested calling them robots instead. The play was performed under the title RUR: Rossum's Universal Robots and the word arrived in English two years later.Meanwhile, cop can mean get, as in the (chiefly British) slang cop out and cop a feel. So policeman, whose job it was to get robbers were called coppers, which was then shortened to cops.And so by 1987 the touching tale of a factory-produced servile-policeman could comprehensibly be called Robocop.Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go.

{"title": "Conan the Talkative Barbarian", "date": "Wednesday 11 August 2010", "text": "A little lesson on film dialogue.The tagline to Conan the Barbarian was: He conquered an empire with his sword. She conquered HIM with her bare hands!Central to the film is the touching and tender romance between Conan and Valeria. However, in the two-hour movie Conan says only five words to the object of his affection, and they're all within thirty seconds of their first meeting.'You're not a guard.''No.'True love, eh? But it does show the value of brevity. A screenwriter friend of mine once explained that film is a basically visual medium. You should be able to watch a good movie with the sound turned off. I have experimented with this theory and it's thoroughly true. Even a verbose movie like Pulp Fiction is utterly comprehensible without the words. There are two gangsters in a car. They get out. They go to a flat with some teenagers in. They search it. They find a briefcase. They shoot the teenagers.Because the storytelling is entrusted to the pictures, the dialogue is free to range through such topics as European hamburger restaurants, foot massages and the Bible. In Conan the Barbarian the dialogue is free not to exist at all.Incidentally, the taciturn script was the work of the young Oliver Stone.Yak, yak, yak, yak, yak."},
{"title": "Terminator", "date": "Tuesday 10 August 2010", "text": "The terminator is the line that divides the sunlit and night-darkened parts of a planet. That was the original (1770) meaning and it's still used today.That's because the Latin terminus meant boundary or limit, from which we get bus terminals, terms and conditions, fixed term parliaments and indeed many terms for things (because a term has a limited meaning).As Tennyson put it:Be near me when I fade away,To point the term of human strife,And on the low dark verge of life,The twilight of eternal day.Anyway, from that you get the idea of terminating somebody's employment. Legally speaking, you can do this two ways: you can terminate without prejudice, meaning that you are open to the idea of re-employing them, or you can terminate with prejudice meaning that you will never hire them again. The latter is for employees who have done something awfully naughty and broken your trust.The CIA employs agents. If you break the CIA's trust and reveal secrets to the other side, your employment will be terminated. Indeed, it will be terminated with prejudice. Indeed, the CIA may make sure that nobody ever employs you again by the simple expedient of murdering you. This they jokingly refer to as termination with extreme prejudice.The CIA being awfully secret, it's hard to say exactly when the phrase was invented. It's first recorded of a double agent in 1969. The important thing for us, dear reader, is that it is this usage that took the word terminate away from astronomy, contract law and bus depots and made the word big and tough and scary.And thus and therefore the T800.As an interesting point of technique: James Cameron just wanted to have a scene where a lorry explodes and then a robot walks out of the burning wreckage. The rest of the plot was invented to lead up to that one image. So the film was written from the end backwards.

{"title": "Die Hard 57", "date": "Monday 9 August 2010", "text": "This week's posts will be devoted to nineteen-eighties action movies. It is a sad fact, but true, that a small minority of people can watch Arnold Schwarzenegger (or whoever it happens to be) shooting somebody in the face with a big gun without appreciating the underlying philological complexities.Once upon a time, in 1702, a chap called William Coward wrote a book called Second Thoughts about the nature of the soul. The point at issue was the soul in Hell. If Hell is purely physical suffering (flames, pitchforks up your bottom etc) then how does a metaphysical soul suffer? Moreover, what about people who can take physical suffering? What about people who laugh at pain? Presumably, they'll be tough enough not to mind Hell.Thus we see by common Observation in Men condemned to die ignominiously at the Gallows, with what Impudence, and strange effrontery they bear their Sufferings; nay, even when they ought to have a check and remorse of Conscience for fear of an immediate Judgement or punishment for their Sins by God AlmightyJohn Broughton, chaplain to the Duke of Marlborough, read Second Thoughts and didn't like it one bit. He got so angry that he wrote a point-by-point rebuttal, which he published under the catchy title Psychologia or An Account of the Nature of the Rational Soul. Broughton mentioned that passage from Second Thoughts and summed it up thusly:...he urges the Case of those that die hard, as they call it, at Tyburn...And that is the first die hard ever recorded. It should be noted that hard here means tough or stubborn. The condemned man does not struggle or try to live. He is, instead, impudent and shows no fear.The phrase would have stuck around in the obscurity of the gallows were it not for another fellow called William Inglis exactly a century later. Inglis was fighting the French at the Battle of Albuera, when he was hit by a four pound piece of grapeshot, which went through his neck and shoulder and lodged in his upper back.Minor injuries like this, though, could not shut Inglis up, nor did the fact that the 57th Foot Regiment, which he was commanding, was being slaughtered seem to bother him. Instead he sat amongst his beleaguered men shouting again and again: \"Die hard, 57th, die hard.\"Astonishingly, Inglis survived and the 57th won the battle. Inglis became a hero, his exploits became famous, and the 57th Foot Regiment were nicknamed the Die-Hards.Thus the phrase became famous and was taken up by all and sundry, especially conservative political factions who used it as an adjective. Those Tories who opposed Home Rule at the beginning of the twentieth century were die-hard conservatives. All it then required was for Alan Rickman to put on a funny accent and the rest is cinematic and linguistic history.I don't know where Bruce Willis stands on the nature of the human soul. I should like to know what he thinks, but Mr Willis maintains a sphinx-like silence on the matter.40 STORIES OF SHEER PHILOLOGY!"},
{"title": "Tennis, Eggs, Love and John Milton", "date": "Sunday 8 August 2010", "text": "When a cricketer fails to get a single run, a zero is written next to his name on the score sheet. This numeral of shame came to be referred to a duck's egg, and then simply a duck. That is why cricketers are out for a duck, and until they score that first run they are trying to break their duck.I had always fondly believed the same to be true of love in tennis. I was told when I was a boy that love came from l'oeuf, which is French for the egg. I was, I fear, wrong. The idea of love as a vacuity comes not from Gallic ova, but from the idea of doing something purely for the love of it, or in other words for nothing.This makes tennis a lot less fun than I thought. It would be more bearable if tennis weren't called tennis. You see tennis is the name of the old French game, real tennis as it's now called, and derives dully from tenez, meaning hold. Lawn tennis, the game that everybody knows now was invented by an Englishman called Major Walton Clopton Wingfield. He didn't call it tennis. He called it Sphairistikè, which was Ancient Greek for ball skill (as in sphere tech). But love and Greek are vanished. So I must console myself with the fact that John Milton was the first person to use the sporting sense of advantage:For if the Scripture be for reformation, and antiquity to boot, it is but an advantage to the dozen, it is no winning cast.Oh, and there's this Shakespearean gem, where Pericles, washed up on a beach, meets two fishermen and introduces himself to them as:A man whom both the waters and the wind,In that vast tennis-court have made the ballFor them to play upon, entreats you pity him:He asks of you, that never used to beg.Mrs M spots a typo"},
{"title": "Shakespeare on Greene", "date": "Saturday 7 August 2010", "text": "There's a good little article by Nicholas Shakespeare on Graham Greene's voice and technique here.Without wishing to pick too many recondite nits, Shakespeare makes two mistakes. First, in the list of influences it misses out Eric Ambler who pretty much created Greene's world, or at least presented it to the bookish public. The Third Man is essentially a (brilliant) reworking of The Mask of Dimitrios. Greene once said that Ambler was the writer to whom all spy novelists are indebted*.Second, Greene is eminently parodiable. You need a skeletal style, a sense of physical inferiority, loneliness and an eye for decay.It was autumn in the late Antibes. I was staying at the second shabbiest hotel at the eastward end of the bay. The green curtains were worn thin and the wind drew chilblains from both my toes.All the other tourists had left the resort. The Place Des Etrangers was empty and several of the bars had taken the opportunity to close up for the winter. I remained. And that's without mentioning Catholics, brothels, diplomats or South America. To prove my point, in May 1980 The Spectator set a competition for parodies of Graham Greene. It was won by Graham's brother, Hugh. Graham's sister, Elisabeth Dennys, came third. Both were writing under pseudonyms. Graham's own entry failed to place, but eight years later he used it as the opening of his last novel, The Captain and the Enemy.Here it is:I am a man approaching middle-age, but the only birthday I can distinguish among all the others was my twelfth. It was on that damp misty day in October that I met the Captain for the first time. I remember the wetness of the gravel in the school quad and the blown leaves which made the cloisters by the chapel slippery as I ran to escape from my enemies between one class and the next. I slithered and came to a halt and my pursuers went whistling away, for there in the middle of the quad stood our formidable headmaster talking to a tall man in a bowler hat who carried his walking stick over his shoulder at the slope like a rifle. I had no idea of course who he was or that he had won me the previous night at backgammon from my father.Oh, and Greene's best book was Travels With My Aunt.*I can't find the exact quotation right now. I may fill it in later.Floella Benjamin may stand to be Mayor of London. The Daily Mirror reports that:London party activists get to pick who will take on Boris and the peer should be a shoe-in for selection if she can be persuaded to stand.The usual phrase is shoo-in. It means that one horse is so much superior to the rest of the field that he can simply be shooed over the winning line.But I suppose that Cinderella was a shoe-in for marrying Prince Charming.I just spazzed a monkey on the gee-gees"},
{"title": "A Parade of Perversity", "date": "Friday 6 August 2010", "text": "Fie on impure Ganymedes, Hermaphrodites, Neronists, Messalinists, Dodecomechanists, Capricians, Inventors of new, or Revivers of old lecheries, and the whole brood of venereous libertines, that know no reason but appetite, no law but lust, no humanity but villany, no divinity but atheism. The list is one of the greatest tools of the author, and is seldom used today. Modern writers have an ascetic tendency to search for the right word. Shakespeare was quite happy to let a mob of nouns run across the page whooping and screaming. Not that the list above is from Shakespeare. It's from Gabriel Harvey's Third Letter on Robert Greene, which makes up in fun for what it lacks in up-to-the-minute relevance.I quote it here, not simply to demonstrate what a good list looks like, but also because of all the lovely and obscure words. So:Ganymede was the cupbearer of the gods, and Zeus' bugger-boy. So by Ganymedes Harvey means catamites. This is a trifle counter-etymological as Ganymede's name seems to have originally come from ganyesthai medea, meaning rejoicing in virility.Ganymede had been born mortal but was granted immortality and eternal youth by Zeus (in exchange for rights of his passage). Ganymede's brother Tithonus was also granted immortality, but not eternal youth, which is all the excuse I need to quote a bit of Tennyson's Tithonus: The woods decay, the woods decay and fall, The vapours weep their burthen to the ground, Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath, And after many a summer dies the swan. Me only cruel immortality Consumes; I wither slowly in thine arms, Here at the quiet limit of the world, A white-hair'd shadow roaming like a dream The ever-silent spaces of the East, Far-folded mists, and gleaming halls of morn. Hermaphrodite in Harvey's time simply meant homosexual. It was someone who, as a contemporary put it, was \"in sexe a man, & in heart a woman\".A Neronist is anybody who imitates the depravity of Nero. This takes in a fair amount of depravity and Neronists deserve top marks for effort. Nero was a transvestite, a ganymede, a hermaphrodite, a mother-killer and a Bad Singer. In the context, Harvey probably meant transvestite as that is the perversion that Nero had and other emperors didn't. Nero had a cousin called Messalina who was the wife of the Emperor Claudius. However, she also screwed almost everybody in Rome. According to Juvenal, she set up her own brothel where she worked as an enthusiastic amateur (with \"gilded nipples\"). According to Pliny the Elder she challenged Rome's most notorious prostitute to see who could have sex the most times in 24 hours. Messalina won with a score of twenty five. Given all that, I'm sure you can work out what Messalinists might be.Dodecomechanists are... well it should be obvious. Dodeco means twelve. Mechanist means either someone who makes things, or someone who believes in a mechanical theory of the universe. The OED has no entry for dodecomechanist or any similar word, so I have had to work it out myself.I can't for the life of me see how twelve could have anything to do with sex. So I think that Harvey was referring to astrologers, more precisely to those astrologers who discount both God and free will, and attribute everything to the mechanism of the stars. You see there are twelve houses in Heaven. That is to say, the sky is divided into twelve parts in which influential stars can be ascendant or descendant.The renaissance astrologer William Lilly said:There is nothing appertaining to the life of man in this world, which in one way or other hath not relation to one of the twelve Houses of Heaven, and as the twelve signs are appropriate to the particular members of mans body; so also doe the twelve houses represent not onely the severall parts of man, but his actions, quality of life and living.So Lilly saw the twelve houses as the mechanism that drives the universe. So he was a dodecomechanist. That attributes to the stars the powers that are properly God's, so it's a tad atheist.Capricians are not in the OED. They may be people who follow their caprices too much, but that seems rather weak in such a strong, bawdy, lecherous and ensemened list. Capricious simply means like a goat (as in capricorn) because goats are so whimsical. Given the context - the ganymedes and messalinists - I shall take a guess that capricians are those who like goats rather too vigorously.So the whole list reads: Catamites, homosexuals, transvestites, sexually confident women, star-gazing atheists, and goat-shaggers.Fie on them all indeed. Now I'm off to invent some new and revive some old lecheries.This is the strangest Budweiser advert I've ever seen"},
{"title": "Dunandunate", "date": "Thursday 5 August 2010", "text": "There's a fun little article in today's Telegraph about words that have been rejected by the OED and now skulk miserably in a vast oubliette somewhere among the dreaming spires. You can read the article here. The failed candidates are mainly portmanteau words. My favourite was dunandunate, which is to learn a new word and then use it incessantly.All the world, as some minor poet once observed, is a stage and all the men and women merely players. To act upon this stage you need, of course, a script, and that script was once given to you not as a book but as a rolled up sheet of parchment. You were given a roll and thus you were given a role.The shift from concrete noun to abstract happened in Medieval French before the word had even arrived on these chilly shores and the first role-player in English was John the Baptist* who \"from God hath receiued such a rowle, it being inioyned him, to prepare the way of the Lord.\"This means that the 98,200 references on the Internet to playing little role rather than a little role read rather awkwardly. Role-play has become a zombie metaphor. If we could forget actors, playing little role would seem fine. But as an actor would only play a little role or a little part, the omission of the indefinite article is liable to raise the thoughtful reader's hackles. Indeed, this whole post comes from a question on the Dear Dogberry page.The problem is, though, that the \"a\" suggests importance. Compare and, if you must, contrast:Elephants play little role in British politicsElephants play a little role in British politicsThe first sentence suggests \"little or no\" and is final. Are elephants irrelevance...s? Yes. The second sentence suggests that pachyderms do something, probably more than you think, and that the writer is now going to explain exactly what small role they play.So, what to do? Should one stay true to the moribund metaphor or stride callously onwards into the waste land of contemporary usage? I can't say I'm sure. I would only write of playing a little role, and when I want to dismiss something as an irrelevant elephant I shall use another phrase entirely.While we're on the subject of actors and their parts, I should inform you that winging it has nothing to do with flying, it is rather instead what an actor does when called in to play a role at short notice and is forced to learn his lines in the wings of the theatre. He can only reasonably do this if he has been given a small roll.Jack Kerouac wrote On The Road on one huge roll of paper.That is the only interesting thing about the book.*So far as I can tell."},
{"title": "Chocolate and Heavenly Bodies", "date": "Wednesday 4 August 2010", "text": "There is a kind of chocolate bar called a Galaxy. There is also a kind of chocolate bar called a Milky Way. I'm not sure on what basis these names were chosen. Tabloid newspapers also pilfer the nomenclature of astronomy. I suppose the Milky Way suggests milk chocolate.Pretty much every European language refers to the Milky Way as the Milky Way. In France it is la voie lactée, in German the Milchstraße, and in Welsh it is the Llwybr Laethog, because the Welsh language was invented by somebody playing a bad hand at Scrabble.The milk comes from the myth that the pale strip of night sky was created when Hera was breast-feeding Hercules and overlactated.In ancient Greek it was also called milk. The Greek for milk was gala, but the genitive of gala was galaktos. This means two things: first galactic is the etymological brother of lactating; and, second, the only difference between the two chocolate bars is that one of them is Greek.That's how it happened"},
{"title": "Otherwhere the Burning Globe", "date": "Tuesday 3 August 2010", "text": "I toddled down to the Globe last night to see Henry VIII or All Is True. It's an odd little play that Shakespeare wrote in collaboration with John Fletcher. However, for me, Henry VIII has two melancholy and sobful associations.When I was a young and hopeful boy I coined a brand new word: otherwhere. I put it in a petrarchan sonnet and for a few days I was happy. Then I looked in a dictionary and all joy fled. It turned out that otherwhere had been around since 1400 and had already been employed by such poets as Wyatt, Milton and Keats; and by such non-poets as Burns. My coinage was devalued and I have never smiled since. So these lines from Henry VIII are like a mallet to my balls:Excuse me;The king has sent me otherwhere: besides,You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him:Health to your lordshipsMuch less importantly for the history of English literature, All Is True destroyed the original Globe Theatre. Here is a letter from Henry Wotton written on the second of July 1613 explaining:I will entertain you at the present with what happened this week at the Banks side. The King's players had a new play called All is True, representing some principal pieces of the reign of Henry the Eighth, which set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and majesty even to the matting of the stage; the knights of the order with their Georges and Garter, the guards with their embroidered coats, and the like: sufficient in truth within awhile to make greatness very familiar, if not ridiculous. Now King Henry making a Masque at the Cardinal Wolsey's house, and certain cannons being shot off at his entry, some of the paper or other stuff, wherewith one of them was stopped, did light on the thatch, where being thought at first but idle smoak, and their eyes more attentive to the show, it kindled inwardly, and ran round like a train, consuming within less than an hour the whole house to the very ground. This was the fatal period of that virtuous fabrick, wherein yet nothing did perish but wood and straw, and a few forsaken cloaks; only one man had his breeches set on fire, that would perhaps have broyled him, if he had not by the benefit of a provident wit, put it out with a bottle of ale.I kept a pint of London Pride beside me, just in case, because I always wear incendiary breeches."},
{"title": "Torpedoes and Turtles", "date": "Monday 2 August 2010", "text": "The Latin word for being tired or numb was torpere. From this verb they got the adjective torpid, which is still with us today. And that would be the end of the story were it not for electrical fish.That there are electric eels is commonly known (and therein, if anybody would listen to me, lies the solution to the world's energy problems. All electrical devices from mobile phones to aeroplanes would have a small fish tank attached and... but I digress). There are kinds of ray that can produce electricity, in fact they can produce 220 volts of the stuff, which is quite enough to knock you out, and therefore make you torpid.In English they were once called numb-fish or cramp-fish, but the educated Latin name is torpediniformes, with the major family being the torpedoes. As Lawrens Andrewe put it in his snappily titled The noble lyfe & nature of man, Of bestes, serpentys, fowles & fisshes y be moste knowen (1520):Torpido is a fisshe, but who-so handeleth hym shalbe lame & defe of lymmes that he shall fele no thyng.Marlowe refers to a chap as a \"vile torpedo\". There was an eighteenth century dandy called Beau Nash who was awfully witty but had trouble writing well. \"He used to call a pen his torpedo for whenever he grasped it, it numbed all his faculties.\" This is a shame as Nash was very charming. When he died his wife went to live in a hollow tree near Warminster.Anyway, in 1776 the Americans were revolting. The British Navy sailed to New York, but so revolting were the Americans that the Brits decided to stay in the channel and blockade the harbour. The Americans did not like this and there was a fellow called Bushnell who invented a submarine with which to attack the blockading British boats in the most unsporting manner.Bushnell couldn't decide what to call his submarine: he seems to have been in two minds between the American Turtle and the Torpedo. In shape it resembled both.It should be noted at this point that the OED, Wikipedia and the Encyclopedia Britannica are all wrong. I checked. There is a lovely contemporary account of Bushnell's machine to be found here and here. The idea of the submarine, called the Torpedo, was that it had a \"magazine or powder\" attached to it that it would screw to the hull of the British flagship. The revolting Americans were foiled by the ship's hull, which was copper-bottomed.The torpedo trying to attach a mineBut the Americans were not to be deterred. Another inventor called Fulton took up where Bushnell left off (Bushnell for some reason ran away to the South and took on a new identity). It was Fulton who decided to call the explosive device a torpedo. He also decided to change it a bit. Rather than the submarine getting right up to the ship it didn't like, it would instead fire a harpoon at it. The explosive device, now called a torpedo, would be attached to the harpoon by a rope and contain within it a timer. So the submarine would pop up, harpoon the ship, and disappear before the charge went off. Full account from 1809 here.Fulton's torpedoes didn't work either. Decades passed during which the torpedo was fitted with a motor and other such improvements, but nothing was sunk with a vile torpedo until 1878 when a Russian ship sank an Ottoman one.And that, dear underwater reader, is how tired and numb came to mean fast and explosive.The Inky Fool in the bath"},

{"title": "The Ascent of the Snob", "date": "Friday 30 July 2010", "text": "Once upon a time, at the end of the eighteenth century, a snob was a cobbler. He repaired your shoes. The word had couple of other meanings. It was the last sheep to be sheared or, if you were a student at Cambridge, it was any of the poor people of the town. Whichever way you looked at it a snob was at the very bottom of the social (or agricultural) ladder.By 1831 this meaning was fixed: a snob was anybody from the lower orders of society: prole, pauper or peasant. A snob was the opposite of a noble, or nob.In the 1859 Dictionary of Slang a snob was defined as \"A low... vulgar person\". And to be vulgar is so often to be showy. True vulgarity is not hidden beneath a bushel but displayed in contemptible ostentation.From there snob, quite understandably, came to mean a wannabe. A snob was somebody who imitated his social superiors. And from there it came to mean somebody who despised his social inferiors, which is where it stood at the beginning of the twentieth century.Then things like Rolls Royces started to have snob-value or snob-appeal until the word became almost (but not quite) synonymous with posh and exalted society. And that's when the French came in and stole the word. I would say that they had borrowed it, but I don't trust the French further than I can cook them.\"C'est snob\" is a French term of approbation. It means chic, posh, sophisticated and desirable. \"C'est si chic. C'est si snob.\" There are no negative connotations.I once heard of a sign in a Parisian clothes shop: Si snob, presque cad. So snob, it's almost cad.And thus has the humble cobbler risen to the top of fashionable Parisian society.Lyrics and translation here."},

It was then invited into English by Nathan Bailey in his Universal Etymological Dictionary of 1727. He defined lychnobite as 'a night walker', but the meaning has now spread to night shift workers and sleepless fishermen.When, in the small and wee hours, I find myself with nothing to do, I settle down and knock off couple of posts for Inky Fool. I lucubrate. I produce lucubrations.To lucubrate is to work by artificial light, from the Latin lucubrare.

{"title": "Improving Shakespeare", "date": "Wednesday 28 July 2010", "text": "This is how Shakespeare worked. In 1599 (or thereabouts) Will wrote Julius Caesar, in which Caesar is murdered by a brute. On the morning of Caesar's assassination his wife warns him not to go out because the weather has been simply dreadful. She says:Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,Yet now they fright me. There is one within,Besides the things that we have heard and seen,Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.A lioness hath whelped in the streets,And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead;Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the cloudsIn ranks and squadrons and right form of war,Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;The noise of battle hurtled in the air,Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.In 1601 (or thereabouts) Shakespeare wrote Hamlet, and in the very first scene Horatio describes exactly the same night:In the most high and palmy state of Rome,A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted deadDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets.That Hamlet's version is shorter is of no great consequence. Of course, Julius Caesar is going to spend more time on Julius Caesar. What's interesting is that Shakespeare is clearly working over his own original, finding the flaws and improving. You can almost hear him muttering \"Did shriek and squeal? Did shriek and sqea... Did squeak! Why didn't I think of that in the first place? Squeak and um... gibber.\"The grave as mouth was a favourite device of Shakespeare, for example \"the grave doth gape/For thee thrice wider than for other men\". But here he has consciously cast that aside and turned the tomb into a bijou rental property. The graves stand tenantless, making it a touch more Christian.You can see Shakespeare fiddling with his words of 1599, dwelling on them, improving them, working them over. And you can see how he worked with the sounds of squeal and shriek. And you can see how he considered and changed his metaphor from grave as mouth to grave as boarding house.   It all relates back to Shakespeare as a worker rather than a genius, which I have written about before here and here.   For more on Shakespeare's attitude to death, see this old post. For the moment, I shall simply add that Calpurnia's \"I never stood on ceremony\" was the first time that anybody had ever stood on ceremony. Stand on already meant pay attention to (as in \"Stand not upon the order of your going\" which means \"don't worry about who leaves the room first\"), but standing on ceremony, that was Shakespeare.   The Inky Fool asking for proof-reading help"},

John Wesley was there post-graduate and Dr Seuss came, hated it and left after a couple of terms.Other colleges had portraits of Auden or Laurence of Arabia up in their halls. We had some rectors from the eighteenth century.However, through Dr Seuss, Lincoln does have one great claim to lexicographic fame. The passage quoted above, which is from 1950, is the first recorded use of the word nerd. It seems, though, miserably unlikely that this is the origin of our familiar insult as by 1951 Newsweek recorded nerd as Detroit slang for a weakling or drip. So unless the underbelly of Detroit was eagerly reading all Dr Seuss's works just as they came out, nerd must derive from another source.Perhaps, it was an alteration of turd; but, if so, why the E?

It may come from quidditas in Latin, meaning that which is, perhaps with the sense of hard cash against airy nothings. But it may come from cud, as in the thing that cows chew. The idea is that cud came to refer to chewing tobacco and therefore to the little piece of tobacco to be chewed. It then came to mean any small amount of anything, and hence a unit of money.Anyway, the first use of quid comes from the 1661 classic Strange News From Bartholomew Fair:The fool lost his purse, but how he knew not; for the reckoning being suddainly brought in, his Quids were vanisht.The Inky Fool in a rare lapse of concentration"},
{"title": "Champagne, Campaign, Campus, Camping and Camping it Up", "date": "Thursday 22 July 2010", "text": "Vin de Champagne originally meant wine from the countryside, as in the modern French campagne. It was only in the eighteenth century, after the English had worked out how to bottle fizzy drinks, that it took on its modern meaning of a Bottle of Bubbly, and contracted itself to those wines produced in the region around Épernay.There's a bit in Horatius by Lord Macaulay where the Etruscans are approaching and:From all the spacious champaignTo Rome men took their flight.A couplet that confused me terribly as a child. All it meant was that the Etruscan army was advancing across the countryside and the country folk were running away.This advance would, of course, have happened during the summer. During the winter troops have to hole up and wait for the snows to depart. Then, with the thaw, they set out on the campagne, which is why they are on campaign, literally on the countryside.Of course, back in Roman times it wasn't called campagne. Campagne comes from the Latin Campus, meaning field. Fields have many uses. For example, you can put university buildings up in a field and that is the campus where young humans go to learn (hippopotamuses are confined to the hippocampus).You can, if you are an army on campaign, simply pitch your tent in a field and that is called a camp. This is what the Etruscan army would have done. Thousands of Etruscan men would have spent their night in a field while their wives, lovers and catamites remained in Etruria. The sexual frustration of thousands of womanless men would have been somewhat assuaged by the prostitutes who made a living by following the army around and offering their bodies to indiscriminate lewdness for hire. These indiscriminate ladies were the camp followers.Nobody is quite sure of the next bit, but those camp followers, meaning harlot, seems to have been shortened to camp meaning tarty, illicitly sexual etc etc etc. This then got switched from queen of the night, to queen, to queer, gay*. And so you get to camp fellows camping it up, which now means the outrageous chap in the bar on Old Compton Street with a glass of pink champagne.An obviously heterosexual champagne drinker*N.B. Alternatively, camp comes from the C18th French se camper, meaning to pose. Nobody's quite sure and the OED cautiously writes \"Etymology obscure\"."},
{"title": "We Few, We Lesser Few", "date": "Wednesday 21 July 2010", "text": "Just in case you didn't know (and I'm sure you did) if you have fewer pints you have less beer. You cannot have fewer beer and you cannot drink less pints. If you are talking about items that you can count - one, two, three, four - you use fewer (in mathematics this is called a discrete variable). If you are talking about an amount you use less. With that in mind, from the sullen quagmire of the Dear Dogberry page comes this query from Eleus:The other day I wrote a comparison of Mozart and Schumann (not just for fun). The whole essay was coming together really well, except for one sentence that I just couldn't resolve.I wanted to say something along these lines: \"Schumann was born less than 20 years after the death of Mozart\". But I had a sneaking suspicion that it should have been \"fewer than 20 years\", and it niggled at me for hours until I went back and re-wrote the paragraph so I didn't have to say it that way at all. Still, I'm a bit befuddled. I know that we say there is \"less time\" - but years are finite, aren't they, so surely it's \"fewer years\". What happens then if the years aren't whole years? For instance what if he was born 19 and a half years after Mozart - is that really \"fewer\"? - because it seems more of a continuum to me. Or what if one person has 3 litres of water and someone else has only 2.9 litres of water. I know the second person has less liquid but do they really have fewer litres? I've been thinking the issue over so much it's become obnubilated and I just can't straighten it out. Am I making a simple thing complicated? Well, Eleus, I think that in your wisdom you have pretty much answered your own question. It would be \"less than a year\" because, though a year is a discrete variable, the time that you are now subtracting from it is not, it is an amorphous amount. The same, I think, applies to twenty years.   This could not be said of \"less than twenty people\", which would be wrong because you could only subtract one person at a time from the crowd.   Just to be complicated. If, rather than using years, you were using markers of a year's passing (like winters) you would need to use to fewer. Schumann was born fewer than twenty winters after Mozart's death, but less than twenty years. There's a Cowboy Junkies song about a long marriage that goes \"It's been thirty summers that I've spent with him\", meaning not that they spend winters apart, but that they've been married thirty years. Had their marriage been shorter, they would have spent fewer summers together. As Wordsworth put it:Five years have passed; five summers, with the lengthOf five long winters!I hope that clears it up.Incidentally, I love obnubilated, which, dear reader, means beclouded.ObnubilatedP.S.

{"title": "A Peal Of Sullen Bells", "date": "Sunday 18 July 2010", "text": "I've been idly reading the Wordsworth book of Gothic Short Stories. It's a collection of dark and gloomy tales form the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and it's amazing how formulaic they all are. Moreover, the formula always seems to involve bells. The very first story, Sir Bertrand, starts with a noble knight riding on a lonely \"heath\" at sunset and hearing \"the sullen toll of a distant bell\". The second story, Captive of the Banditti, opens with the words \"The sullen tolling of the curfew was heard over the heath\", and who should hove into view but a noble knight. And so on and bloody so forth. Nothing can happen in Gothic literature unless \"the clock from the dungeon tower was heard to strike with unusual solemnity.\" It's rather like the distant barking of a dog in modern literature.Three points occurred to me:1) How can a chime be sullen? I mean, I know I'm being a trifle difficult here, but when you start to think about all these sullen bells, you do start to wonder.2) \"The castle bells rang out a merry [!] peal at the approach of a winter twilight\" [The Spectral Bride] Again, I'm being a smidgen pedantic, but I know a bellringing fellow who absolutely insists that a peal of bells lasts for several hours. He has rung one peal of bells in his life and this is, apparently, a great achievement. A bell tower contains a bunch of bells that can be rung in different orders. Each of these orders is called a change, hence ringing the changes (which has nothing to do with spot-the-difference puzzles). There are several thousand possible permutations and a peal of bells contains a minimum of five thousand changes. So a peal is a very long thing indeed. I don't know why anybody would want to ring five thousand changes, but bellringers' minds are funny places that probably shouldn't be investigated too thoroughly.Originally, a peal was just any stroke on a bell. But by 1796 The Times was able to write that \"The peal was divided into ten parts, or courses, of 504 each\". So the anonymous author of The Spectral Bride was on the wrong side of pedantry. A peal, like a peck or a swathe, is one of those measurements that should be used with fear and trembling.3) Bells are not always clichés. Literature contains some beautiful tintinnabulations. Here, in no particular order, are my favourite literary chimes. Obviously, there's the curfew tolling the knell of parting day in Gray's Elegy, but I prefer the The Waste Land, which has:...each man fixed his eyes before his feet. Flowed up the hill and down King William Street, To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine. And there's John Donne's amazing feat of starting and ending a paragraph with phrases that entered the language whilst nobody can remember the middle:No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as any manner of thy friends or of thine own were; any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind. And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. There's Falstaff's beautiful \"We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow,\" which Orson Welles used as the title for his film. But the best bell I know is Baudelaire's La Cloche Fêlée, which is incurably French but translates loosely as:The Broken BellSweet sadness on a winter night to hear,While on the grate still burns one crackling logAnd strange and distant memories appear,The sound of church-bells singing through the fog.So sweet a sound, so happy and so sure.Old age cannot defeat that steadfast bell:Its firm and faithful call so good, so pure:The guardian of truth! God’s sentinel!My soul is broken.

{"title": "Pool, Pool And Throwing Stuff At Hens", "date": "Friday 16 July 2010", "text": "I spent yesterday either in the swimming pool or playing pool. This strict regime was broken only by a delicious lunch of roast chicken. It occurred to me, even in my languorous and licentious state, to wonder whether there was any connection at all between the two pools. There is not.The pool that I was swimming in is of Germanic extraction and relates only to places like Liverpool, which means muddy waters (there is some sort of pop music joke to be made here, but I can't think of it at the moment).The pool that I was playing (or, if you're American, shooting) goes back to 1848. Before that it was a gambler's card game and the pool was the money to be won. This goes back to the French poule, meaning the pot of money to be won. This is a trifle odd as une poule is French for a hen (as in the English pullet).So far as anybody can tell the reason for this is an old French game: le jeu de la poule. In Medieval France medieval frenchmen would thrown medieval french stuff at a hen, which would run around squawking. Whoever hit the hen won a prize: hence pool the card game and hence pool the variant of snooker and billiards. Hence also, pool your resources or carpooling. This surprised me as I had always imagined that when you pooled your money you were putting it into the same... pond, as it were. So it turns out that my pool-playing related more closely to my lunch than to my swimming. It also means that a gene pool is, etymologically, a race of chickens.The Inky Fool's animal sanctuary soon went to the bad"},

{"title": "Some Winds", "date": "Monday 12 July 2010", "text": "In 1274 Kubla Khan tried to invade Japan. He got an awful lot of soldiers and had just landed them and was getting ready for a nice battle when it started to rain and the wind began to blow. So, rather than risk their being marooned, the troops were ordered back into the boats. This was a mistake because the wind was very strong indeed and all the ships sank.Not to be deterred Kubla tried again in 1281 and this time an even bigger typhoon raged for two days straight and spoiled everything. The Japanese were now convinced that Japan was being saved from invasion by \"Divine Winds\". The Japanese for divine was Kami and the Japanese for wind was Kaze and so the defenders of Japan in the 1940s were called Kamikazes.Kubla was forced to return to the mainland and concentrate on pleasure domes.The Chinook helicopters, of which the RAF do not seem to have enough, are named after a spring breeze that blows in North Western America and melts the snow away.The Mistral blows southward through Provence. It's name comes from the Latin magister, meaning master, for this is a dominant wind. It gives you a headache and (I once heard but cannot confirm) that in Medieval French law if the mistral had blown for three days that would be considered a defence for murdering your wife.The Simoom (which is alluded to in Edgar Allen Poe's Berenice) is an Arabic wind, formed on the uplands and driven down to the lowlands where the pressure increases its temperature in quite incredible and incomprehensible ways. In 1859 there was a simoom in Santa Barbara, California. The morning was a pleasant twenty-something (70s F) degrees and then at noon the temperature shot up to 54 degrees, or 133 degrees Fahrenheit, where it remained for the next few hours.

Hamlet is talking about how he plans to kill Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (who then become dead).Pumpernickel (bread) was (for some reason unrelated to good marketing) originally just a German insult.

{"title": "The Dog Days", "date": "Tuesday 6 July 2010", "text": "The Dog Days start today. Well, it depends who you ask, really. But if you ask the Book of Common Prayer the Dog Days start today, and that's good enough for me.Dog Days have nothing directly to do with dogs: they are named after the Dog Star, also called Sirius, which is the brightest star in all the heavens (excluding the sun). Back in Roman times the Dog Star rose with the sun during late summer and it was believed that it was this conjunction of the two brightest stars in the sky that caused the heat of July and August.If you want to know what the next couple of months will be like, you need only consult Hesiod's Works and Days:In the season of wearisome heat, then goats are plumpest and wine sweetest; women are most wanton, but men are feeblest, because Sirius parches head and knees and the skin is dry through heat. But at that time let me have a shady rock and wine of Biblis, a clot of curds and milk of drained goats with the flesh of an heifer fed in the woods, that has never calved, and of firstling kids; then also let me drink bright wine, sitting in the shade, when my heart is satisfied with food, and so, turning my head to face the fresh Zephyr, from the everflowing spring which pours down unfouled, thrice pour an offering of water, but make a fourth libation of wine. Which is, verbatim, what I'm going to say the next time I see a waiter.That Sirus heats the earth is not true scientifically, but it is true poetically; and poetry is Much More Important than truth. If you don't believe that principle, try using the two methods to get laid.Shakespeare mentions the Dog Days in Henry VIII. He describes a red-nosed fellow by saying: There is a fellow somewhat near the door, he should be a brazier by his face, for, o' my conscience, twenty of the dog-days now reign in's nose; Milton appears to mention the heat of Sirius in Lycidas:Ye valley low where the mild whispers useOf shades and wanton winds and gushing brooks,On whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looksPope complains that \"The Dog Star rages\". But my favourite reference to the Dog Days is, for some reason, Fons Bandusiae by Horace. It's only a passing reference and it's in Latin but it translates very roughly as:Sabine spring, as clear as glass,Where the floating flowers pass,Take tomorrow’s sacrificeIn your water cold as ice:(For it grew its horns in vain,For it will not breathe again)Let the kid-goat’s hopeless bloodMingle with your perfect flood.No: the Dog Days’ horrid heatCannot touch you. Oxen’s feetStray from ploughshare to your pool,Wander, rest there, and are cool.Fame is yours, for I shall write – And eternity reciteIn perpetual murmuring tones – Of the oak upon your stones.However, as I said, the Dog Days have nothing to do with dogs and nothing whatsoever to do with Hamlet's comment that:Let Hercules himself do what he may,The cat will mew and dog will have his day."},

One well placed vocative can set the authorial tone for a whole book, blog post or ransom note.Dear = marriedDarling = Engaged or theatrical/fashion/overbearing female/gayMy child = Biblical and therefore whimsicalMy good man = 1950s, Middle Class and slightly enragedDear Reader = AustenishGentle Reader = Eighteenth Century.

{"title": "Independence", "date": "Sunday 4 July 2010", "text": "I've just discovered that Independence Day is not simply a Will Smith film. It is, in fact, the day on which nobody must be hanged. The Latin pendere meant hang, and its past participle was pensum. In meant not, de meant from, sus meant down... anyway:If you are independent you are not dependent because the only things that are dependent are pendulums and pendants which hang around your neck. Pendants are therefore pending, or indeed impending. They are, at least, suspended, and are therefore left hanging in suspense. Weighing scales hang in the balance. Scales can weigh out gold for paying pensions, stipends and compensations in pesos (but not pence).All such dispensations must, of course, be weighed up mentally. One must be pensive before being expensive. You must give equal weight to all arguments in order to have either equipoise or poise. If you don't your scales will hang too much to one side and you will end up with a preponderance and propensity towards your own penchants. Whether these penchants make you perpendicular, I am too polite to ask.I hope that this post on the pendulous hung together. If it did, it was a compendium.Right. If you frequently weigh things up you think (pensare) about them. You give people flowers to make them think about you. Florologically speaking, the traditional flower to make you pensive for a loved one is the flower in the picture which was therefore called a pensée, or, in Modern English, a pansy.

Could charm - lovely, fresh-faced, care-free charm - ooze? Charm comes from carmen which is Latin for song. Ooze comes from wase which was Anglo Saxon for mud.There's something quite blood-curdling about these forced marriages between unsuitable words. I cannot see the words \"Intimate Wipes\" without shuddering. A few weeks ago I was sidling around the London Print Fair with Mrs Malaprop, lusting cashlessly for this picture or that. Mrs Malaprop observed with that if I ever did make any money I would \"only go and squander it on collectables.\"I detest the word collectables. It is the most pointless, hideous piece of jargon in the English language. You can collect anything: stamps, jam jars, baboons or oak trees. Every concrete noun could be collected, and even some abstract ones (cool and calm). So to lock that predatory horror of a word into a dark sentence with the delightful squander seemed the apogee of linguistic cruelty.Squander is a splendid word (of obscure etymology). It has just enough morality to have meaning, but not enough to remove its sense of fun. George Best once said: I spent a lot of money on booze, birds and fast cars. The rest I just squandered.The River Ouse: not as muddy as you thoughtP.S. First I should point out that Mrs Malaprop was aware of her linguistic antitheses. I would never wish to slight her language. Second, I think somebody else pointed out the intimate wipes before me, possibly Stephen Fry, but I'm not sure."},
{"title": "Bulwer-Lytton or: The Pen is Mightier than The Great Unwashed", "date": "Friday 2 July 2010", "text": "The winners of the Bulwer-Lytton prize for the worst opening of a novel have been announced. Edward Bulwer-Lytton was a nineteenth century novelist, poet, playwright, politician, philanderer, debauchee and wife-incarcerator who put four phrases into the English language. Here are the first three:The pen is mightier than the sword   - From the play Richelieu, since disproved by experiment.The Great Unwashed   - From Paul Clifford, of which more anon.The Coming Race    -And if that is an unfamiliar phrase then you don't know nearly enough about Nazi mysticism or the lyrics to David Bowie's Oh You Pretty Things. It comes from a novel Bulwer-Lytton wrote about super-people who live underground, obviously.However, poor Bulwer-Lytton will be forever remembered not for those sublimities, but for the ridiculous opening lines of Paul Clifford, which was published in 1830:It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents--except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.Apparently those first few words were much quoted in the Peanuts cartoon strip (which I fear I have never read). Anyway, the phrase \"It was a dark and stormy night\" have become a byword for bad opening lines.Rightly so. That whole paragraph tells you nothing at all about the story that is to follow. Zero. Zilch. Nada. Rien. Is this going to be a novel about a serial killer or about an amusing talking cat called Gerald? I don't know and that paragraph gives me not a hint of a whiff of a clue. It is a collection of clichéd images full of rain and darkness and signifying bugger all. As with a proper cliché it could be cut out and prefixed to almost any novel set in London (and, with the alteration of a word, any city). That is what's wrong with it.Which leads me inevitably on to the Bulwer-Lytton prize. Contestants have to write the first few lines of an imaginary terrible novel. This year's winner is a lady called Molly Ringle and her paragraph goes: For the first month of Ricardo and Felicity's affair, they greeted one another at every stolen rendezvous with a kiss--a lengthy, ravenous kiss, Ricardo lapping and sucking at Felicity's mouth as if she were a giant cage-mounted water bottle and he were the world's thirstiest gerbil.But... but... that's not terrible. That's not terrible at all. So far as I'm concerned that's brilliant. I would read on. If I picked up a book in the bookshop and that was the first paragraph I would be leaping for the till, cash in hand and whooping joyously. It's surprising, it's funny, it is utterly different. It is everything that Bulwer Lytton's paragraph is not. There is the suggestion of Ricardo's desperation, of the unhealthiness of the relationship and yet of its comical contemptibility.Molly Ringle's lines have none of the problems that scar Bulwer-Lytton's immortal drivel. They are original. They are amusing. They could not have been put at the start of any other book. I have a damned fine idea of the kind of (very odd) novel that I'm about to read. The story has already got itself going and I've been introduced to the main characters, their relationship and the animal to which they can best be compared. I care about Ricardo already.But Felicity's horrid.For all the winners and honourable mentions follow this link.P.S. When he was old Kingsley Amis became so depressed with the tedium of contemporary literature that he vowed never to read another novel unless it began with the words \"A shot rang out.\"P.P.S.

Yet you have to call it something, otherwise the workers in the factory will become curious.

Otherwise you would leave. My eyes were once caught, peeled and glued to the stage. I have required glasses ever since.Incidentally, the first recorded use of the phrase to catch somebody's eye is in Pride and Prejudice at the moment when Mr Darcy first sees Elizabeth:\"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\" \"Which do you mean?\" and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said: \"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\"Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. Even more incidentally, Pride and Prejudice was originally called First Impressions, and it was under that title that it was rejected for publication (publishers were as brilliant then as they are now). Sense and Sensibility did get published and was such a success that Miss Austen decided she'd better stick to the alliterative-abstract-noun formula. So she changed First Impressions to Pride and Prejudice and the book has since sold (roughly) twenty million copies. In America the novel was first published as Elizabeth Bennet with P&P demoted to the position of subtitle.Even more and more incidentally (and I promise I'll stop in after this) Pride and Prejudice is the origin of the phrase \"my humble abode\", which is how Mr Collins always describes his house.The Inky Fool's humble abode"},

It was only when I got to page 14 and found the word \"drugstore\" that I realised that I wasn't reading stilted, rhythmless, English: I was reading very good American.This, dear reader, is a problem. When you speak you have the advantage both of body and of accent. When you write you do not. Your words, which in your head were a ferocious rant or a bewitching drawl, on the page are lame, dull and denuded of voice.This problem is also very easily solved. What you need are filler words. Every language has them.I saw a good film last night.I saw a jolly good film last night.The first (although it might be informative and factual) is a dead sentence. The second tells you how to read it. It is as though the sentence came with an instruction booklet: the voice is British and posh. Moreover, having put that one word in the first sentence the reader will have got the idea and you may now continue ad infinitum and nauseam with your film review, safe and secure in the knowledge that your reader, whoever he, she or it happens to be, will be reading it in the voice that you intend.Voice in literature is an infinitely complex and subtle business. Filler words cannot do the whole job, but they will do half of it and will do that work for No Effort Whatsoever on your part. If that American novel had simply used the word goddamned in the first sentence I would not have been tempted to throw it on the fire.So, for your delight, instruction and edification here are some filler words, insertable almost anywhere, along with what I consider to be their implications:[All English, unless otherwise stated. Most would go at the beginning of a sentence, especially those followed by a comma]Jolly = Posh Jolly well = PosherI mean = Intense studentI believe = Slightly overintellectual and carefulHonestly, = Middle-aged femaleAwfully = Posh Achingly = AestheteBleedin' = LondonBelieve me = GossipThe thing is = Chronic debaterThat's as maybe, but = Straight-talking common manI think = Dull as ditchwaterI suspect = CleverI imagine = WhimsicalI suppose = AmiableI asseverate = Call the asylumLet me tell you = No. I won't.Indeed, = AcademicIndubitably, = WooeeahUtterly = Solidly built, middle-class male with obedient childrenHell, = AmericanAwesome = AmericanYou know, = Probably American, but not the kind I likeOh and = Female (for reasons I would find hard to explain)Simply = Ditto.

Infuriating for the same reason.The interesting thing is = Then why didn't you cut the last bloody paragraph?Intense(ly) = Passionate and (almost) intellectualRather = ChappishPretty = Middle-ClassKind of = Hippy, know what I mean? = Not necessarilyNow, dear reader, you may shudder at this requirement. You may feel that your voice is so godfuckdamned unique that no such filler word could ever do it justice. But remember that without them your voice may not be unique, it may simply be non-existent.

There isn't really a zw- sound in English, but try saying Swinburne's swirling swans when you're drunk or drowsy and the Sw will be thickened to Zw.The odder suggests (at least to me) doddery, plodder and Hodder & Stoughton.\"Sorry.

{"title": "Mo Tay For No Thing", "date": "Monday 28 June 2010", "text": "I am in a funk, gentle reader, a terrible funk. It's about my pronunciation, which I've just discovered to be abominable. It has been abominated. And the abominater is no less a deity than P.G. Wodehouse himself. I quote tearfully:Many lyricists rhyme as they pronounce, and their pronunciation is simply horrible. They can make \"home\" rhyme with \"alone,\" and \"saw\" with \"more,\" and go right off and look their innocent children in the eye without a touch of shame.It pains me dreadfully to admit this, but I have always pronounced \"saw\" to rhyme with \"more\" (or versa vice). Indeed, I move in such reduced social circles that I have never heard anyone pronounce it any other way. The OED suggests that the word used to be pronounced mo, but doesn't make clear when this stopped, or was shooed off to the ghetto where it still survives in film titles like Mo' Money.A Receipt to Cure the Vapours by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu starts like this:Why will Delia thus retire,    And idly languish life away?While the sighing crowd admire,    'This too soon for hartshorn tea.Because in the Eighteenth Century tea was pronounced tay. Just as in Pope's Epistle to Miss Blount the lonely girl will:... pass her time 'twixt reading and bohea,To muse and spill her solitary tea.Bohea being a kind of black tea that was pronounced bohay.To go further back into the fogs and sea frets of time, Shakespeare wrote a very odd sonnet about the goddess Nature creating a woman, falling in love with it and attaching a penis. The penis meant that Shakespeare was therefore Not Interested.And for a woman wert thou first createdTill Nature as she wrought thee fell a-dotingAnd, by addition, me of thee defeatedBy adding one thing, to my purpose nothing.Which is an odd little rhyme to us, as the pronunciation was no-thing, which makes perfect etymological sense. Once upon a time (allegedly), Ben Jonson (the poet, not the sprinter) was composing his own epitaph in a tavern. He began:Here lies Ben JonsonThat was once oneThen he asked Shakespeare to finish it off. Will wrote:Who while he lived was a slow thing,And now, being dead, is nothing.Now go and read this poem on pronunciation.Here runs Ben JohnsonWhose foolish nonchalance onDoping made him a fast thingAnd now, forgot, he's a past thing."},

Occasionally she thinks about buying an ice cream. Her skin is as red as a pepper. Dickens put it much better than I. Here is a little something from the nineteenth chapter of Bleak House.It is the hottest long vacation known for many years. All the young clerks are madly in love, and according to their various degrees, pine for bliss with the beloved object, at Margate, Ramsgate, or Gravesend. All the middle-aged clerks think their families too large. All the unowned dogs who stray into the Inns of Court and pant about staircases and other dry places seeking water give short howls of aggravation. All the blind men's dogs in the streets draw their masters against pumps or trip them over buckets. A shop with a sun-blind, and a watered pavement, and a bowl of gold and silver fish in the window, is a sanctuary. Temple Bar gets so hot that it is, to the adjacent Strand and Fleet Street, what a heater is in an urn, and keeps them simmering all night. There are offices about the Inns of Court in which a man might be cool, if any coolness were worth purchasing at such a price in dullness; but the little thoroughfares immediately outside those retirements seem to blaze. In Mr. Krook's court, it is so hot that the people turn their houses inside out and sit in chairs upon the pavement—Mr. Krook included, who there pursues his studies, with his cat (who never is too hot) by his side. The Sol's Arms has discontinued the Harmonic Meetings for the season, and Little Swills is engaged at the Pastoral Gardens down the river, where he comes out in quite an innocent manner and sings comic ditties of a juvenile complexion calculated (as the bill says) not to wound the feelings of the most fastidious mind. I am sure that my readers in warmer climes will scoff at this post, but that is merely because they don't understand. London is not designed to be hot. We have no air-conditioning. I own two pairs of shorts and one of those is so little worn that it still has a school name-tape sewn inside. Nobody has ever thought to put a bench in the shade. The best a Londoner can do is to shelter from the sun under awnings that usually protect him from the rain and hail. It is for this reason that the Bible reads so strangely to an Englishman: heat and sun are curses, rain and shade God's promises. Only on days like this can an Englishman's heart pant for cooling streams.I am now off to sit in a square in Bloomsbury in direct and perfect imitation of Dickens.

{"title": "Jörmungandrian", "date": "Thursday 24 June 2010", "text": "From the abyss of Dear Dogberry page comes this shriek for help:Being in the general proximity of Wimbledon you will doubtless have heard of the record-pulverizing match between Nicolas Mahut of France and John Isner of the USA, currently suspended at 59-59 in the 5th set. Our ESPN commentators were having a terrible time coming up with fitting adjectives: \"epic,\" \"freakish,\" a \"battle royale,\" a \"clash of wills,\" etc.. \"Epic\" yes, but not just any epic--after all, you could recite the Iliad all the way through in a mere 24 hours. Last year's final was epic. This match is Mahabharatan. At least, that's the best I can do. What say you? From your vast lexical treasury, your bathypelagic well of verbal resourcefulness, can you generate suitable superlatives? I eagerly await your offerings. Signed,Dumbstruck in Delaware Well, Dumbstruck in Delaware, I should begin by saying that Mahabharatan is a damned fine coinage. For readers who don't know (and I'm sure there's one of you), the Mahabharata is a Sanskrit epic that's about ten times longer than the Iliad. I like mahabharatan. I shall steal it and use it for my own sinful purposes.Can I do better? I'm not sure. It's pretty easy to coin words for large. You find a large thing and turn it into an adjective. Gargantua, the giant hero of a book by Rabellais, gave us gargantuan. The Biblical monster Behemoth gives us behemothic. The Himalayas give us Himalayan and so on and so forth. But none of these words fit. They are all bulky, and the tennis match is long.My best suggestion would be jörmungandrian. Jörmungandr is a snake from Viking mythology which grows so long that it encircles the earth and ends up biting its own tail. As I mentioned in a previous post the circumference of the earth is 24,901.55 miles, so Jörmungandr is very long indeed. There's an added advantage that the snake biting its own tail is one of the mysterious symbols that pops up in almost every culture in the world. Mythographers call it the ouroboros and generally agree that its some sort of symbol of the infinite (or possibly of wisdom). That means that if you were captured by some strange and isolated tribe of Amazonian headhunters and forced, at hatchet-point, to describe the Mahut-Isner match you could confidently use the word jörmungandrian. The head-hunters might not understand you immediately, but they would doubtless have a cognate symbol in their own twisted and macabre mythology.Well, Dumbstruck in Delaware, I hope that helps. And remember: having a bigger vocabulary doesn't necessarily make you a \"better\" person, what really matters is whether you can use that vocabulary to negotiate with tennis-obsessed cannibals. DogberryThe Inky Fool engaging in pest-control"},

But I'm so delighted with the name that I care not a whit, jot or iota for poor Tommy Turdman's feelings.Incidentally, I am not alone in my infantile delight at the word turd. T.S.

{"title": "Hesternal Pop Music", "date": "Monday 21 June 2010", "text": "The French cannot do pop music. Everybody knows this except the French. I once met a fellow who had a theory to explain this gallic failure. He said that all the best pop songs have Germanic lyrics.English is basically made up of Germanic words like need or house and Latinate words like require and habitation. This fellow assured me that the lyrics to Yesterday were entirely Germanic in origin. This is not true. The words in bold are, ultimately, Latinate.Yesterday,All my troubles seemed so far away;Now it looks as though they're here to stay.O, I believe in yesterday.Suddenly,There's a shadow hanging over me;I'm not half the man I used to be.O, yesterday came suddenly.Why she had to go,I don't knowShe wouldn't say.I said something wrong,Now I longFor yesterday.Yesterday,Love was such an easy game to play;Now I need a place to hide away.O, I believe in yesterday.That's only seven Latinate words out of 84*. By contrast, I just went through the main news story on the BBC website and thirty of the first hundred words were Latinate. I then tried Sonnet 18 which scored fifteen out of 104.It is well known that you can prove anything, everything and nothing with statistics. However, I think that this theory holds a little water. Of the seven Latinate words in Yesterday none of them sound particularly Latin. There are no -ations and no -ities. I had always assumed that trouble was Germanic and had never connected it with turbulare. Sudden, which ultimately comes from sub-ire, meaning go up to, has lost the B that made the derivation obvious, and now finishes with a German-sounding -en.Some words have become so Anglified that they can be re-imported: use and utility, trouble and turbulence. So, that score of 92% Germanic underestimates the effect. I reckon the the chap was technically wrong, but effectively right.And the cause? I can think of two reasons. 1) The more basic the concept, the more likely it is to be expressed by a Germanic word. That's because the Anglo-Saxons were here before the Normans. They got to name love and hate, while the Frenchies could only Christen attraction and disinclination. 2) Germanic words sound better for pop songs. The consonants are harder. Germanic words thud and bang about, while Latinate terminologies expire in languorous confusion.I have never believed in Fowler's dictum that the Anlgo-Saxon word should always be preferred to the Latinate. Nor do I imagine for one second that Paul McCartney was consulting an etymological dictionary as he wrote. If he had been I doubt he would have got anywhere at all. I don't know how many conclusions you can draw from this tiny sample, I just find it interesting.Oh, and if you were wondering (and I'm sure you weren't), hesternal means of or pertaining to yesterday. Indeed, the song could usefully be renamed Hesternopathia, which means \"yearning for yesterday\". With a name like that, it wouldn't have needed any lyrics at all.*Not counting repeatsP.S.

{"title": "Mucking About With Phrasal Verbs", "date": "Sunday 20 June 2010", "text": "There's a wonderful thing called a phrasal verb. Essentially it's a verb plus a preposition, which together give you a whole new meaning: for example, doing up a house. A foreigner learning English might know the word do and the word up, but would still be unable to work out why you were performing a building skywards. And when he discovered that you could also do in your enemies, he would be done for.Muck out = clean a stableMuck in = helpMuck about = play uselesslyMuck up = ruinSo a lazy and incompetent stable boy could be said to muck about constantly, out and in rarely, and up everything.Rhetorically, this trope of using one verb in several different senses (She left in a taxi and a flood of tears) is called syllepsis. Without doubt the greatest exercise is syllepsis is Have Some Madeira M'Dear by Flanders and Swann.Printed lyrics here.You are invited to compose similar sentences and leave them in the comments.

{"title": "Coming, I Saw and Conquered", "date": "Friday 18 June 2010", "text": "Contemplate the title of this post. It is less natural than the original. It is less clear than the original. It is less snappy than the original. In short, it is worse.Over on the Dear Dogberry page, Moptop has been complaining about a novel filled with sentences like this:Doing something, he did something else.That structure is extraordinarily common in written English, and rare in spoken. Sometimes the order is reversed and you get:He did something, doing something else.Puffing meditatively on his pipe, Aloric shot an elephant. \"I'll give you £100 pounds for the trunk,\" cried the Inky Fool, flicking frantically through a dog-eared book of recipes.There are two problems with sentences like this. The first is well known, indeed it's one of the few bits of grammar that still get taught in schools: the dangling modifier.In the sentence \"Puffing meditatively on his pipe, Aloric shot an elephant\" we understand that it is Aloric who is doing the puffing. The participle belongs to the first noun after the comma. Therefore, in the sentence \"Walking up the street, my mobile phone began to ring\" it is technically my mobile phone that is walking up the street.That sentence is on the cusp of alrightness. Grammatically it's wrong, but it would be hard to misunderstand. Indeed it would require a small effort of will. Some dangling modifiers are so much part of the language that they cannot be faulted.Speaking of which, the weather's nice today.You would have to be a pedant of Himalayan proportions to ask how the weather could speak. Indeed, if you asked me that, your body might never be found*. The problem with danglers is not one of Absolute Grammar, the problem is that they can be unintentionally comic or offensive.Beautiful yet simple, the Inky Fool will perform Fur Elise in the bakery at midnight.Is, to be honest, correct however you read it. Bill Bryson cites this lovely line from Time magazine.In addition to being cheap and easily obtainable, Crotti claims that the bags have several advantages over other methods.Which makes poor Crotti a cheap slut.The second problem with such sentences was rather nimbly pointed out in a comment on yesterday's post. The Antipodean was correcting one of my myriad typos.\"Prophecy?\" she says, sipping from her chipped fine bone china coffee-mug. Actually I probably wouldn't talk and sip at the same time, but you get the gist. The participle implies synchronicity. This means that you have to be dreadfully careful about what actions you yoke together. Sloppy novels are filled with lines like: \"Skidding to a halt, he leaped out of his car\", which is simply a dangerous and irresponsible way of parking, especially on the school run. One of the sentences Moptop cited on Dear Dogberry ran:Opening his eyes, he watched Lazar.The frustrating thing about that sentence is that it could so easily be recast. He opened his eyes and watched Lazar.Is that so hard? Is that so odd? As I said at the beginning of this post, these participle sentences are pretty rare in spoken English. People tend to chat in short simple sentences connected by conjunctions (speech, if you listen carefully, has very few full stops)**. It is only when a fellow sits down to write that he suddenly starts converting every other verb into a participle. As well as sounding slightly unnatural, this exposes him to the dangers described above and is Utterly Unnecessary. It is so easy to avoid these dangers. It is so much more natural to have two verbs connected by and. Here are the other sentences Moptop cited along with the natural alternative:Standing over him, Zoya raised the knife.Zoya stood over him and raised the knife.Hearing the guards at the window, Malysh picked up a slate. Malysh heard the guards at the window and picked up a slate.Standing up, she glanced into the hallway. She stood up and glanced into the hallway.That's how you'd say it, so why not write it that way?   Of course there are times when the actions are simultaneous. More specifically, there are times when one continuous action acts as the background for a shorter one. \"Reading Hamlet, I came across this line\" should not be recast, because the actions are not consecutive. One occurs during the other and so the participle is dandy and fine. I am not attempting to outlaw the practice, merely to observe the overuse and the risk.   I once read (and cannot now find) an essay by Clive James on writing for the radio. He observed that English is a basically linear language. Perhaps a more inflected language like Latin or German would allow for more grammatical complexity, but it is unnatural for English. Though we can subordinate our clauses we tend not to. This, he said, counts doubly for the radio. The reader of a book can always check back to the beginning of a sentence to work out who or what is doing the verb, a listener cannot. So sos, ands and buts beat commas. Sell participles and buy conjunctions. Or: selling participles, buy conjunctions.However, I should conclude by saying that the rules of English are neither hard nor fast. Consider the following from Paradise Lost. Brave young grammarians, intent on making a name for themselves, have set off into this sentence hoping to find a main verb and never been heard of again. But it's wonderful. This is a fallen angel addressing Satan in Hell.\"If thou beest he--but O how fallen! how changedFrom him who, in the happy realms of lightClothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshineMyriads, though bright!--if he whom mutual league,United thoughts and counsels, equal hopeAnd hazard in the glorious enterpriseJoined with me once, now misery hath joinedIn equal ruin; into what pit thou seestFrom what height fallen: so much the stronger provedHe with his thunder; and till then who knewThe force of those dire arms?\"The Inky Fool contemplating a typo*Although I might post it back, piece by piece, to your nearest and dearest. ** Far commoner is \"I was walking down the street when my mobile began to ring\". However, neither of the dangers described in this post can apply to such sentences."},

But pin number it is, and pin number, I prophesy, it will remain, like a chipped tea-cup that one has become sentimental about.The New Scientist invented a term for such repetitions back in 2001. They called it RAS Syndrome, the RAS standing for Redundant Acronym Syndrome. But the habit is far older than that. In 1668 John Dryden was already referring to \"the hoi polloi\". Polloi is Greek for people and Hoi is Greek for the, so the hoi polloi means the the people. Indeed, his is the first usage cited by the OED. Yet, Hoi polloi it must remain because if we dropped the hoi we'd lose the lovely rhyme that distinguishes the base peasantry from the hoity toity.And if you're American and have been wondering what in blazes a cashpoint is, it's the British term for an ATM machine.The Inky Fool freeing the polloi from the hoiN.B.

Have you ever listened to Purple Haze and wondered whether Jimi Hendrix is saying:Excuse me while I kiss the skyOrExcuse me while I kiss this guyHave you? That's a mondegreen. A mishearing of  a song. The term was coined way back in 1954 by a lady called Sylvia Wright. She described how her mother used to read her a poem that went:Ye Highlands and ye Lowlands,Oh, where hae ye been?They hae slain the Earl O' Moray,And laid him on the green.And she had always understood that last line to be:And Lady Mondegreen.Which makes some sort of sense, an earl suggests a lady. I am as prone to mondegreens as the next man, possibly proner; and my mishearings often make no cents at all. I was once involved in an argument and then a wager about whether the drink sangria is mentioned in Lou Reed's Perfect Day. I insisted that it is not. You see I know the song by heart. It goes:Just a perfect dayDrinks and grey are in the parkI had never stopped to consider what \"grey\" would be doing in a park. Mrs Malaprop informs me that at her school the Banarama lyric \"Guilty as a girl can be\" was universally heard as \"Guilty as a cocoa bee\". If you're French and perverse (and what Frenchman isn't?) you can wonder gallicly to yourself why Edith Piaf is singing about a pink aeroplane: L'avion rose/La vie en rose.But the point of this post is not foolish mistakes, but the good ones.I shall never recover from being given a lovely big hardback collection of Bob Dylan Lyrics 1962-2001. My two favourite lines were gone, vanished, vanquished by the cold, dead hand of print. First, there's the great statement of the human condition in Subterranean Homesick Blues:Get born, keep on.I loved that line. All life summed up in four syllables: birth and survival. That rotten book revealed that it was in fact \"Get born, keep warm\", and I've never been truly happy since. But worse than that mondegreen, much worse was what unambiguous ink did to It's All Over Now Baby Blue. I knew the song started like this:You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last.But whatever you wish to keep you better grab it fast.He understands you orphans with his gun.It's a brilliant line. First you have a reversal, something equivalent to \"He nurses you with his fist\", but more brilliantly, there's the leaping of categories. Understanding with a gun is what a philosopher would call a category error. A category error is a statement which is not simply wrong, but which could not conceivably be right because words from two different categories have been yoked together.Salmon cannot read newspapers, but I can imagine one doing so. A salmon reading a newspaper is not a category error. However, \"There's too much Tuesday in my rhubarb crumble\" is unimaginable as, though Tuesday is a noun, it's not a physical one and could therefore not be mixed up with rhubarb. Nor could you have too little or too much Tuesday. Similarly one cannot understand with a gun in any normal sense. That's what gives Dylan's line its power. It parodies violence by expressing it as a form of comprehension. Clever, eh?That bloody book.Yonder stands your orphan with his gun.I shall maintain till the day I die that my cloth ears improved those songs.I was reading a friend's website the other day and momentarily misread the line \"Next time there better be mistakes\" as \"Next time there'll be better mistakes.\"The Inky Fool listening to Bob DylanP.S.

For those of you who don't know, the vuvuzela is the horn that is ruining the World Cup by making every match sound as if it is being played inside a beehive.There are three theories on the origin of the word:1) It comes from the isiZulu meaning \"make a noise\"2) It comes from Township slang for shower, because it resembles a shower head.3) It is imitative of the sound it makes: vu-vuThat last one is a reduplication* like murmur, because the vu-vuing continues for ninety minutes. My favourite reduplication is in Malay. Malay doesn't have normal plurals, you form them by simply repeating the noun, so tables would become tabletable. That's fine so long as the singular noun wasn't formed by reduplication already. The Malay for butterfly is rama-rama, so butterflies is rama-rama rama-rama. The Malays also repeat verbs to intensify them, so \"I really like\" would be rendered as \"I like like\". We occasionally do this in English, when somebody says \"I've got to, got to see that film\". Therefore, the Malay for \"I really like butterflies\" is:Saya suka suka rama-rama rama-ramaNot to be confused with Ramalamadingdong.P.S. I am not, alas, a scholar of Malay. I've been searching round the net and found some back-up, but my prime source is that a policeman told Mrs Malaprop this when she was reporting that her shoes had been stolen by a monkey.P.P.S.

{"title": "Snarling Snobs and Sniggering Sneaks", "date": "Monday 14 June 2010", "text": "The Chambers English Dictionary lists 80 words beginning with the letters SN and 62 of them have derogatory, disgusting or violent connotations. Only three - snazzy, snog and snug - are cheery. And in making that calculation I didn't even count as negative the five words that refer to a scythe-handle. I do not believe, dear reader, that this is a coincidence. Here's the list in all its horridness:Snab, snabble, snack, snaffle, snafu, snag, snaggle-tooth, snail, ‘snails, snake, snap, snaphaunce, snapper, snar, snare, snark, snarl, snash, snaste, snatch, snath, snazzy, snead, sneak, sneap, sneath, sned, sneck, sned, snee, sneer, sneesh, sneeze, snell, snib, snick, snicker, snicker-snack, snickersnee, snicket, snick-up, snide, sniff, snig, snigger, snip, snipe, snip-snap-snorum, snirt, snitch, snivel, snob, snod, snoek, snog, snoke, snood, snook, snooker, snool, snoop, snoot(y), snooze, snoozle, snore, snorkel, snort, snot, snotter, snout, snow, snowk, snub, snick, snudge, snuff, snuffle, snug(gle), snush, snuzzleIf you remove the obscure terms you're left with 46 words of which 38 are negative, which is a nastiness quotient of 83%. Just look at all the fun and horrible sentences you can dream up:The snivelling snitch sneered at the snaggle-toothed sneak.The snotty snob snubbed the snarling snake.Other such groups of words have been found (although I believe I'm the first with the SNs*): there are the ump words - dump, clump, frump - and a peculiar number of words referring to dim light that begin GL: glisten, glimmer and gloaming. It's called sound symbolism and academics are forever snarling at each other about it.There are two main theories on the subject. 1) It's a complete coincidence. There are a lot of words in the language and something like that is bound to happen**. 2) People naturally look for patterns in language. Perhaps there were once only a few nasty words beginning SN, but there were enough that when people started inventing new words or altering old ones we did it to fit the pattern. This effect snowballs and we even start to let the pleasant SN words die out because they don't fit.I believe in the second theory. The reason? Because in that tiny sample of the English lexicon, in those five pages of a seventeen-hundred-page dictionary, are two words coined by Lewis Carroll: Snark and snicker-snack. The Snark is, of course, the mysterious and deadly centre of The Hunting of the Snark, and snicker-snack is the sound of the Jabberwocky's beheading.This shows that Carroll, the master word-coiner, could discern the pattern and use it to his advantage. Moreover, when I checked in the OED I found that there were lots of neutral SN words that had disappeared and died. (Although the OED did list the delicious word Snollygoster, which means a shrewd, unprincipled politician).This rule of the snarling SN also has consequences for the naming of fictional characters. For example, J.K. Rowling was on to a good thing when she called her villain Severus Snape. (Snape does pop up in the OED meaning a rebuke or a change to cold or bad weather, but Rowling named him after a village in Suffolk).The result of all this is that you can invent a word and drop it into conversation and it will sound right. \"That snikey bastard!\" you can shout. \"I'm going to snobble him.\"Of course, it may just be coincidence. It may be that the theory of sound symbolism is a fiction, a fib, a fallacy, a fantasy, a phantasm, a falsehood and a fraud.But if you wanted clinching proof of SN's hellish and horrible connotations, I need only say that it is also the post code for Swindon.Finally, and simply because we're here, my three favourite SN words were:Snicket - A narrow passage or alleywaySnirt - A suppressed laughSnool - One who submits tamely to wrong or oppressionSnudge- EITHER to save in a miserly way OR to be snug and quietSupernova SN1987a (I bet it's horrid)*It has been noted that there are several SNs relating to the mouth and nose (snout and snuffle), but not the negative aspect that I'm pointing out. Mind you, I stand ready to be corrected. There are also a lot of words to do with cutting.**This is the classical, Saussurian view. Saussure famously said \"The sign is arbitrary\"; unfortunately he was driving at the time."},

You see, spinsters are all going to Hell for having disobeyed God's first commandment to man(and woman)kind: go forth and multiply*. Once in Hell the old maid's punishment will, for reasons that I can neither discover nor divine, be to lead apes around.The notion gets a mention in Much Ado About Nothing:LEONATO: You may light on a husband that hath no beard.BEATRICE: What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man: and he that is more than a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his apes into hell.The bear-ward, since you ask, is a bear-keeper. There was a bear-baiting pit next door to the Globe Theatre and it seems that they kept apes there as well. That's also where they would have borrowed the bear that was used in The Winter's Tale, which resulted in the stage direction: Exit, pursued by a bear.That scene takes place on the coast of Bohemia, which of course doesn't exist as Bohemia is landlocked, but did suggest the name for a collection of poems by Lachlan Mackinnon that (if I remember aright) has a poem with the first line \"Virtual koala\".The Inky Fool attempting to be Bohemian*Go fifth and divide."},
{"title": "Bedraggled, Bedrabbled and Befuddled", "date": "Saturday 12 June 2010", "text": "I like to spend my weekends bedraggled, bedrabbled and befuddled; simply because I adore the words.I love the word bedraggled for two reasons. First, I have a irrational predilection for be-words: bemoaned, befogged and benighted (literally overtaken by night). A fellow called Ammon Shea read the entire OED and among his favourite discoveries was unbepissed, which means not having been pissed upon. Second, I'm fond (and I know this sounds silly) of the frequentative suffix -le. If you continuously wag your head and dance a jig and bob up and down, then you waggle and jiggle and bobble. If you can't stop putting food in your gob, you gobble. If you keep prating and pissing, you prattle and piddle. I imagine it therefore follows that if you've not been pissed on frequently, you are unbepiddled.And if you have been repeatedly dragged about, then you are bedraggled.Bedrabbled is formed in the same way and means almost the same thing: dirty with rain and mud.Befuddled therefore means that you are fuddled, and everybody knows what fuddling is. What's that, dear reader? You don't know what fuddling is? My word, what a sheltered life you do lead.Fuddling is drinking. Nobody knows quite where the word comes from. It is not, alas, a frequentative. There is a word fud, but it's a noun and means either buttocks or a woman's pubic hair. No, fuddle is an orphan of mysterious ancestry, but it does produce the lovely word fuddler.Now, I must be off as I am planning (in the words of The Gentleman's Magazine of 1756) to: \"fuddle away the day with riot and prophaneness.\"Saturday night with the Inky Fool"},
{"title": "Weltmeisterschaft", "date": "Friday 11 June 2010", "text": "Oh all right. As you are no doubt agonisingly aware, an emergency meeting of illiterate millionaires has been convened in South Africa. The bountiful game is a subject of dispute amongst the literati. Albert Camus said \"Everything I know about mortality I learnt from football\". Camus played in goal and one of the most vivid moments in The Plague is the nostalgia felt for the prepestilential football matches:...the once familiar smell of embrocation in the dressing-rooms, the stands crowded with people, the coloured shirts of the players against the tawny soil, the half-time lemons or bottled lemonade that titillated parched throats with a thousand refreshing pin-pricks.Shakespeare mentions the game only once, with the insult \"You base football player.\"Football has donated many phrases to English. Some are old and venerable: kick off, play into touch, score an own goal and move the goal posts. Some are new and telling: roasting and handbags. But what, I hear American readers cry, is Dogberry talking about?Soccer.And the word soccer was invented by the decadent poet Ernest Dowson. Obviously, the word derives from a syllable of Association Football. But the first citation in the OED is Dowson writing in 1889 \"I absolutely decline to see socca' matches.\"Dowson also wrote:They are not long, the weeping and the laughter,Love and desire and hate;I think they have no portion in us afterWe pass the gate.They are not long, the days of wine and roses:Out of a misty dreamOur path emerges for a while, then closesWithin a dream.Dowson contemplating injury time"},
{"title": "Lord and Lady Panivorous", "date": "Thursday 10 June 2010", "text": "Here's a splendidly useful word: panivorous.It means \"that eats or lives on bread\" (Latin panus) and should therefore be wildly applicable. Yet it seems only ever to have been used once, in 1845, by Mrs Catherine Gore who wrote of a man that he was: \"A boulanger in the panivorous kingdom of France.\"We are all panivorous. Stand outside any office block at lunchtime and watch the panivorous staff scuttle back from the sandwich shop leaving, like Hansel and Gretel, a trail of crumbs.There's the simple bread that we eat; there's the religious \"daily bread\"; and there are a hundred and one hidden etymologies for when we eat our words. The Old English word for bread was hlaf, from which we get loaf; and the old English division of labour was that women made bread and men guarded it. The woman was therefore the hlaf-dige and the man was the hlaf-ward.Hlafward and HlafdigeHlaford and HlafdiLavord and LavediLord and LadyAnd when the lord and lady finally sit down and devour the bread, they become companions; because a companion is someone you eat bread with in the same way that a mate is somebody who shares your meat.Had enough? I don't care. The old word for beg was briber, and the way to get rid of a beggar was to palm him off with a morsel of bread called a bribe, hence bribe. Ciabatta is Italian for carpet slipper because that's what the bread resembles, just as baguette means stick. And gritty was not first applied either to dramas or to roads but to dear old, mere old bread.'So cast your bread upon the waters,' as a friend mine likes to say. 'You never know, it might come back as smoked salmon sandwiches.'These do not count as ciabattas"},
{"title": "She Who Must Be The Grand Panjandrum (BA Oxon)", "date": "Wednesday 9 June 2010", "text": "Last night, as the clock struck twelve, I was busily proof-reading when a chap asked me what exactly a Grand Panjandrum is.There was an eighteenth century actor called Charles Macklin who boasted that he could memorise any speech after hearing it only once. Another eighteenth century actor called Samuel Foote, who had played Othello to Macklin's Iago, decided to write an unmemorisable speech for Macklin. He came up with this:So she went into the garden to cut a cabbage-leaf to make an apple-pie; and at the same time a great she-bear, coming up the street, pops its head into the shop. \"What! No soap?\" So he died, and she very imprudently married the barber; and there were present the Picninnies, and the Joblillies, and the Garyalies, and the grand Panjandrum himself, with the little round button at top, and they all fell to playing the game of catch-as-catch-can till the gunpowder ran out at the heels of their boots.Perhaps Foote wrote it down. History is mute. Though the speech was composed in the 1750s it wasn't published until 1825 and the authorities seem authoritatively confused as to how the challenge was put. The important thing is that it's a passage that Lewis Carroll would have been proud of. No decent human being could read the words \"So he died\" without at least smiling. In conclusion, Grand Panjandrums may be recognised by the little round button at the top.The Grand Panjandrum, though, should never be confused with the Great Panjandrum, which was a (slightly insane) explosive device invented during the Second World War and never used. It was called a panjandrum in reference to the gunpowder running out at the heels of the boots.My conversation then turned to She Who Must Be Obeyed, which my interlocutor believed came from Rumpole. She comes from the novel She by H. Rider Haggard. (I always pictured Rider Haggard as a gaunt man on a horse. I was miserably disappointed to find he was a healthy looking fellow with a beard). She is a novel about a couple of jolly brave Victorian fellows who find a secret kingdom in Africa ruled by an immortal and intolerably beautiful lady whom the natives refer to as She Who Must Be Obeyed. She falls in love with one of them and it all ends in tears and wrinkles.She is one of the most extraordinary books ever written. In essence it is the greatest myth composed in modern times: the sort of story that takes a seat in the reader's soul. In execution it is a rather silly ripping yarn: the sort of thing I loved when I was twelve. Imagine the myth of Oedipus with Biggles in the main part.Like the Bellman and bad news, I like to work in groups of three. So I shall leave you with the opening paragraph of another African adventure: Black Mischief by Evelyn Waugh.'We, Seth, Emperor of Azania, Chief of the Chiefs of Sakuyu, Lord of Wanda and Tyrant of the Seas, Bachelor of the Arts of Oxford University, being in this the twenty-fourth year of our life, summoned by the wisdom of Almighty God and the unanimous voice of our people to the throne of our ancestors, do hereby proclaim...' Seth paused in his dictation and gazed out across the harbour where in the fresh breeze of early morning the last dhow was setting sail for the open sea. 'Rats,' he said; 'stinking curs. They are all running away.'Not haggard"},
{"title": "The Grosser Grocer", "date": "Tuesday 8 June 2010", "text": "Grocers are gross, and there are one hundred and forty-four of them.It all comes, of course, from the French word gros meaning large. A grocer buys his goods in bulk or en gros. 144 is a dozen dozens or, if you're a medieval Frenchman*, a grosse douzaine. In English the word shifted from big to thick and thence to coarse until it came to mean plain damned rude. Thus in Hamlet Gertrude says of the expired Ophelia:There is a willow grows aslant a brook,That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;There with fantastic garlands did she comeOf crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purplesThat liberal shepherds give a grosser name,But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:Damn those liberal shepherds with their voting reform and their dirty names for flowers. (For those filthy-minded readers who were wondering, dead men's fingers are Orchis Mascula which were also called dogstones (Latin testiculus canis), dog's cods, cullions or fool's ballocks. See the bottom left of the illustration that I have so thoughtfully provided.)   All of which is a long way round of saying that gross already meant rude in Shakespeare's day. However, the modern sense of gross as a slang exclamation equivalent to yuk may simply be a shortening of the intensifier. Gross, or large, incompetence leads to gross stupidity, gross misconduct and then gets its second word chopped off.   If you are completely absorbed in something, you are engrossed. And a country that produces nothing other than gerontophile pornography has a Gross National Product.   Finally, by means of Admiral Vernon, gross is the ultimate origin of groggy, but I have explained that elsewhere.     Disgusting  *Are you?"},

There's nothing too wrong with that: I like hopeless eccentrics. But I would have hoped for just a tiny little something from the academy's first press release: not that it should be written as a perfect villanelle, nor even that it should be beautiful, but at least that it wouldn't be \"moving with the times\" or bemoaning \"the tragic failure of the British education system\" or rejecting \"passing fads\". How, in the name of all that's tautologous, could a fad not be passing?Read this turd of a paragraph:Other languages, French and Spanish for example, have supreme authorities that try, while moving with the times, to define what is good and acceptable usage and what is not. They do not stop the language from changing over the years, but they do provide a measure of linguistic discipline and try to retain valid and useful new terms, while rejecting passing fads.For starters, let's see whether anything could be cut without affecting the meaning.Other languages, French and Spanish for example, have supreme authorities that try, while moving with the times, to define what is good and acceptable usage and what is not.

I have never accepted a word and therefore cannot see how I could not accept one. Food in a restaurant can be unacceptable because it can be sent back; but a word cannot be, unless you're very quick with the ear plugs.

{"title": "Napa Happy Nappy Valley (and Dr Johnson)", "date": "Sunday 6 June 2010", "text": "There is an area of South London known to all, and even sundry, as Nappy Valley. It's basically Wandsworth. The reason for the name is that the area is positively teeming with fecund young professional couples whose constant rutting has given it the highest birth rate in Europe (or so saith Wikipedia without citation). [N.B. Nappy is English for diaper. In fact non-Londoners may want to skip this post].I happened to be discussing the area with Mrs Malaprop yesterday and, of course, the conversation leapt, flea-like, to the Origin of the Name. I asserted that it was to do with Napa Valley in California, where the wine comes from. I said that the name was obviously down to affluent, priapic couples changing nappies whilst sipping white wine.Mrs Malaprop said that she had always assumed that it was to do with Happy Valley in Kenya, where the murders happen.So today I set about investigating. It turns out that Mrs Malaprop was right and I was wrong, which I feel remains a moral victory for me.The phrase, you see, is not English in origin. The first reference that I can find to London's Nappy Valley is from The Independent in 1997. But I discovered this in the Sydney Morning Herald in 1984:Horror films soar in popularity during the school holidays. Children's films are most popular in Tuggeranong (known as Nappy Valley) and other far-flung suburbs which are the newest and have the youngest families.Tuggeranong is a suburb of Canberra, so it would seem that Australia can claim the original Nappy Valley. However, in her riveting account of the 1984 general election campaign in New Zealand (not written till 1985) Josephine Grierson records her press officer warning her of victory:\"You'd better watch it you know or you may end up with three years of \"Nappy Valley\"! I've already heard you referred to as the \"Pakuranga housewife\".Pakuranga is a suburb of Auckland. So parallel births of the name? Some strange antipodean synchronicity? No. Just outside Auckland, a mere, 23 miles from the aforementioned Nappy Valley is a little place called Happy Valley. They make honey there. So it must be a pun on the name: the appy, not the nap.In Australia it's a little farther, but the connection is still easy to make. You go from Canberra to Adelaide (both in the South East) and you have a well known suburb again called Happy Valley. So, though there may not be a Kenyan connection, I am satisfied that in both cases it's a pun on Happy Valley. So where does Happy Valley come from? Perhaps it's just the twee imaginings of an optimistic settler. But I can get the phrase straight back to Dr Johnson, which makes me much happier.Dr Johnson wrote Rasselas. It's about a prince (coincidentally called Rasselas) whose father decides to keep him away from the sins of society. So he is brought up in an impregnable valley where he is given all that he could possibly want other than knowledge of the world. However... well here's the opening of the second chapter:CHAPTER II--THE DISCONTENT OF RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.Here the sons and daughters of Abyssinia lived only to know the soft vicissitudes of pleasure and repose...I like to think that those distant settlers were thinking of Rasselas when they did their naming, if only because Rasselas has suffered an terrible, terrible fate. You see, it's a Very Good Book, but it's identical in concept and was published in the same year as Candide by Voltaire, which is an Absolutely Bloody Wonderful Book. Candide is a book about a completely innocent young man who sets off on a world tour that allows for lots of satirical vignettes. Rasellas is a book about a completely innocent young man who sets off on a world tour that allows for lots of satirical vignettes. The result is that almost nobody bothers to read Rasselas. Even I have lost my copy and don't particularly care. I can't even recommend that you read it because Candide is better. A merely good book, like Rasellas, cannot compete.Evelyn Waugh probably considered this. He once wrote a story called A House of Gentlefolks. It begins, like Rasselas and Candide, with a boy who has been kept completely away from the world until his eighteenth birthday being allowed out (with a guide) and setting off on a series of satirical vignettes. Except that he doesn't. They're about to set off on a world tour when, after only ten pages the narrator says:It seems to me sometimes that Nature, like a lazy author, will round off abruptly into a short story what she obviously intended to be the opening of a novel. And a lawyer arrives to take the boy back. For an ardent lover of early Waugh like me, that sentence is unutterably sad. I think that Waugh was thinking of the fate of Rasellas. There was, though, a man called Isaac Brown Jr, who liked Johnson's book and called his son Rasselas Wilcox Brown, and Rasselas went to Pennsylvania and founded Rasselas PA.Now you tell me."},

If I tell you that I'm going to do something Right now, you can be pretty much guaranteed to discover me half an hour later lying in a hammock with a glass of Pimms and a copy of Ulysses open at the first page.This has linguistic consequences. Do you know what the Anglo-Saxon for immediately is?SónaBut so many people over the last millennium have promised to do something sóna that the word has become the modern English soon.The same has happened to in a minute. Though there is a perfectly precise time mentioned in the phrase I would probably use it to mean anything up to... half an hour? Certainly no more than an hour.I think I'm a little better with in a second. But it probably still means anything up to five minutes. In fact, I can't say in a second in a second, which means that the phrase is in itself untrue. I might as well say, \"I cannot speak.\"Listen to the radio or watch the gogglebox and you're as likely as not to hear a phrase like \"In a moment we'll be talking to Lord Lucan, but first here's the weather/The Archers/The Ring Cycle.\"We are so lazy, so indolent, so idle so incurably languorous that we cannot be trusted with words. Anon, as in I'll see you anon, also meant straightway or in one, now it wanders in unlimited futurity.So what to do? We need a new and unsullied measurement of time. Where to find it? Why, in the notes to The Cloud of Unknowing of course, where else? The Cloud of Unknowing is a medieval religious work that says, amongst other things that we should really pull our socks up. When we get to the Pearly Gates (incidentally the Pearly Gates are not up in the air, they are the gates of the New Jerusalem as mentioned in Revelations: the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one pearl) when, as I say, we get to the Pearly Gates we will have to account to St Peter for our whole lives: not just every hour, not just every minute, but every athomus. An athomus is the smallest unit of time there is, or so theologians reckoned, it is the indivisible moment, like an atom, which etymologically means unsplittable, a derivation that didn't help Hiroshima. The idea of the athomus was taken from St Paul, Corinthians 15v52, which is usually translated as the twinkling of an eye. But, medievals being medieval, it had of course been calculated, though I've never been able to work out how. An athomus is, officially, fifteen ninety-fourths of a second.So there it is. Now I must be off. It's a lovely sunny day and there's a hammock, a bottle of Pimms and a copy of Ulysses waiting impatiently in the garden. I'll be there in an athomus.This cloud may be unknowing.P.S. If any medieval scholars out there can explain to me how the length of an athomus was calculated, I'd love to know."},

This from Lucky Jim:Dixon was alive again. Consciousness was upon him before he could get out of the way; not for him the slow, gracious wandering from the halls of sleep, but a summary, forcible ejection. He lay sprawled, too wicked to move, spewed up like a broken spider-crab on the tarry shingle of the morning. The light did him harm, but not as much as looking at things did; he resolved, having done it once, never to move his eyeballs again. A dusty thudding in his head made the scene before him beat like a pulse. His mouth had been used as a latrine by some small creature of the night, and then as its mausoleum. During the night, too, he'd somehow been on a cross-country run and then been expertly beaten up by the secret police. He felt bad.This from the Second Canto of Don Juan by Byron:Few things surpass old wine; and they may preachWho please - the more because they preach in vain -Let us have wine and women, mirth and laughter,Sermons and soda-water the day after.(Although it wasn't old wine that did for me, but a pantagruelian dry martini that ambushed me at midnight near Hyde Park Corner.) And here is the original screenplay of Withnail & I.WITHNAIL emits an accelerating groan. Something to do with a headache. He looks across. Eyes like a pair of decayed clams.WITHNAIL: Where's the whisky?MARWOOD: What for?WITHNAIL: I got a bastard behind the eyes. I can't take aspirins without a drink...The bottle is discovered. The cork popped.

WITHNAIL is becoming emotional.MARWOOD: Where are we?WITHNAIL: How should I know where we are? I feel like a pig shat in my head.And for those of you who are fond of Withnail, here is a piece of trivia that not even Paul McGann knew until I told him in a moment of drunken sincerity. The character referred to as Marwood in the script is never named in the film, hence the title. However, when I finally saw Withnail & I in a cinema I noticed the name written on the envelope containing the telegram. You can't see it on a television because (like an unfinished whodunit or invader of Iraq) it doesn't have the resolution. So Marwood is named, and the film's title must and shall be changed.From Hell's black heart I curse thee"},
{"title": "Shakespeare Was Talentless", "date": "Wednesday 2 June 2010", "text": "The popular notion of genius is that it is some sort of flammable substance, like cardboard, that burns brightly and then burns out. We think of Coleridge writing the Ancient Mariner, six more poems that are worth reading, and then surviving, utterly uselessly, for decades. We think of Auden or either of the Amises and we do not consider it at all strange that their first books were their best and their most recent are a trifle embarrassing. We think of the solo careers of the Beatles and all those other burnt out rock stars. Often this idea of burning is confirmed when the flammable genius in question drops down dead: Keats, Shelley, Byron, Marlowe etc etc. Too great to grow old and other such claptrap.It is curious that we think like this, but that is the popular notion. Shakespeare does not obey it in the slightest.Shakespeare’s first plays are, to be frank, nothing special. Nobody is quite sure of the order the early plays were written in, but we have a fair idea. If we take as a rough metric of a play’s quality how many quotable lines it contains, we can go through and you'll see what I mean.How many lines can you quote from Titus Andronicus? None? Then you’re normal. Don't worry. Comedy of Errors? Love’s Labour’s Lost? Anything springing to mind? Henry VI part 1? Nope? Nope.Shakespeare’s first famous line is probably “First thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.” It's hardly one of the immortals but it's the only memorable thing in Henry VI part 2. Part 3 has a couple of good lines. Richard III has four or five and so it grows: steadily and by degrees. Each play is a little better than the last. Each play shows a slight improvement, a greater technique, the mistakes are ironed out.Of course there are dips, but over the course of a decade, by these slow degrees, Shakespeare went from Titus Andronicus to Midsummer Nights’s Dream, to Julius Caesar to Hamlet, which contains precisely a thousand and one memorable lines. And there are no great turning points on the way. There is no coming of age, no moment when he realised the Secret. If his ability was a gift from God then it seems to have been paid in instalments. He climbed Mount Helicon by inches. He can appear rather like the dim but diligent schoolboy who learns the syllabus by heart. He was the opposite of the Coleridge method; the opposite of the brightly blazing genius whose combustion we have become so familiar with.Of course, there's nothing strange about this idea when you think about it. Logically one would imagine that anybody in a non-physical job should get better and better as time goes on. That's how we would think of doctors or lawyers or poultry farmers, yet for some reason it's not how we think about artists and not how we think about genius.If, by genius, we mean a gift that a man is born with and which cannot be learnt, then Shakespeare didn’t seem to have it. I said elsewhere that Shakespeare was all technique. I would go so far as to suggest that he had no genius at all. He learned it.Which leads to the curious conclusion that the greatest artist the world has ever produced was talentless.Not that good."},
{"title": "Two High-Altitude Songs", "date": "Tuesday 1 June 2010", "text": "I once ate pie in the sky. I was on an airplane and the Spaniard next to me did not understand my mirth. In origin, though, such pie is not simply an airborne comestible, but a heavenly one. There was a terribly left wing song-writer called Joe Hill who didn't like the Salvation Army. The reason Hill didn't like them was that rather than feeding the poor, the Salvation Army simply promised them a better afterlife if they converted. So Hill took a Salvation Army hymn called In the Sweet Bye-Bye and wrote new and parodic words to it. The song began thuslyly:Long-haired preachers come out every night,Try to tell you what's wrong and what's right;But when asked how 'bout something to eatThey will answer with voices so sweet:You will eat, bye and bye,In that glorious land above the sky;Work and pray, live on hay,You'll get pie in the sky when you die.And that's where the phrase comes from. Here's a video of a chap called Blind Drunk Al singing it:That was back in 1911 and Joe Hill was executed four years later for owning a red handkerchief (and/or murder). In 1943, when the Americans had finally noticed that there was a war on and had decided to join in the fun, a pair of songwriters called Harold Adamson and Jimmie McHugh decided to write a stirring patriotic song. The melody by McHugh is actually rather similar to The Preacher and the Slave, but the words by Adamson are brave and hopeful and all-American: What a show! what a fight! Yes, we really hit our target for tonight.The song is about a damaged warplane returning from a sortie. They've lost one of their engines and now they're Comin' in on a Wing and a Prayer. And that's where the phrase comes from. Pie in the sky, like all food on airplanes, tastes horrid."},
{"title": "Inkling", "date": "Monday 31 May 2010", "text": "Given that a duckling is a small duck, a darling is a small dear and a godling is a small god, you might be lured into the belief that an inkling is a small splash of ink on the face of a fool. Dear reader, you would be half-right.Ling is being used as a diminutive suffix but the ink comes from incen, meaning to mutter or whisper. So an inkling is a soft whisper.However, the word has suffered every indignity at the hands of lexicographers and a giddy public. Dr Johnson, wrongly but reasonably, thought that it was to do with clink. He wrote that \"The word is derived by Skinner, from inklincken, to sound within\", a bit like tinkling.Others thought that it was related to inclination, which is why Robert Southey wrote in 1824 \"I feel inklings to address an ode to the people of Liverpool\", a usage as perverse as the desire that it expresses.Still others decided (as with sideling) that there simply must be a verb inkle of which inkling was the gerund. This seems to have been employed mainly by the pseudo-dialect school of writing. Richard Blackmore, who wrote Lorna Doone, has \"His marriage settlement and its effects, they could only inkle of\", Hardy uses it to typically tedious effect, but Samuel Butler in Erewhon Revisited has the lovely line:People like being deceived, but they also like to have an inkling of their own deception, and you never inkle them.An inkosi contemplating inkyo"},
{"title": "Sir Charles Sedley", "date": "Sunday 30 May 2010", "text": "Sir Charles Sedley wrote some of the most beautiful poems in English; and you, dear reader, have never heard of him. There's a reason for that. Sedley was a Restoration poet and a contemporary of Rochester (of whom you have no doubt heard, there was even a film about him with John Depp). At the time both were famous, much printed, and much read. The difference between the two was that Rochester wrote obscene poems and Sedley wrote beautiful ones. Rochester wrote:Full gorged at another timeWith a vast meal of slimeWhich your devouring cunt had drawnFrom porters' backs and footmen's brawn, And Sedley wrote:Love still has something of the sea, From whence his Mother rose;No time his slaves from doubt can free,Nor give their thoughts repose.This should illustrate the difference both of taste and talent. But - Oh miserable but! - when Sedley had died and the first complete edition of his verse was published, several obscene poems were wrongly included.This didn't matter much at the time as nobody minded obscenity very much. Sedley and Rochester continued to be popular all the way through the eighteenth century, which T.H.White rightly called The Age of Scandal, until they were both stopped dead by the Victorian period. Rochester, chock full of cunts and cocks, disappeared from the bookshops and bookshelves of the respectable. He vanished from the canon. And poor Sir Charles, with those obscene verses wrongly ascribed to him, vanished too.Then came the twentieth century. Freud rose, feminism rose, sex revolved, love was free (or at least cheap), and academia became home to a bunch of puerile, giggling, sex-obsessed idiots. In ivy-clad quadrangles pasty-faced dons studied Rochester and squealed with delight because he had used a rude word. 'Look!' they cried. 'He said a naughty thing! Now I'm going to get to say a naughty thing in a lecture! I'm going to be able to write a book paper called The Gilded Vagina: Constructions of the female pudenda 1672-1705 and I'll get to print a dirty word!'Unfortunately, if you swear as much as I do, it's hard to get excited about the occasional fuck*, and I have never been able to discern any further merit in Rochester's verse.And Sedley? At the beginning of the twentieth century somebody worked out that the obscene poems had been misattributed. So the verses that had destroyed his reputation under Victoria were no longer there to revive it the period of the New Puerility. And that is why you have never heard of him. You can still find scraps here and there. He has, quite justly, a couple of poems included The Oxford Book Of English Verse, one of which is called A Song To Celia. I am not sure of this (as I can't be bothered to read the anthology cover to cover) but I think that Song To Celia may be the only poem in the collection without a single simile or metaphor. There are occasional metaphoric uses of words - tied or afford - but other than that the purity and directness of the lyric is astonishing. Here it is in full:Not, Celia, that I juster am   Or better than the rest.For I would change each hour, like them,   Were not my heart at rest. But I am tied to very thee   By every thought I have; Thy face I only care to see,   Thy heart I only crave. All that in woman is adored   In thy dear self I find,For the whole sex can but afford   The handsome and the kind. Why then should I seek further store,   And still make love anew? When change itself can give no more,   'Tis easy to be true.And if, dear reader, you are now minded to run out and buy yourself a copy of his complete poems, I should warn you that they are very hard to come by, although up on the net here. My own copy (a birthday present from Mrs Malaprop and Everet Lapel) was printed in 1707. There does seem to be some sort of reprint available on Amazon, but as Sir Charles himself said:Justice has bid the world adieu,And dead men have no friends.Except me.Mine!*It should, perhaps, be noted that Sedley's life was utterly scandalous and debauched, he's most famous for starting a riot by washing his penis in a glass of wine (he was also Speaker of the House of Commons, although I don't think we should hold that against him). This post is poetical and cares not a whit for biography.P.S. For any North London readers, Sedley lived next door to the Steele's in Chalk Farm.P.P.S. I honestly didn't realise when I wrote this post that today is the 350th anniversay of the Restoration. I was thinking along the lines of yesterday's post on simplicity of expression."},

{"title": "Prepositions The End Of Sentences At", "date": "Friday 28 May 2010", "text": "There is an old, old joke about a chap who asks a librarian what section a particular book is in. 'I'm afraid', says the librarian, 'that I can't answer questions that end with a preposition.' 'All right,' says the chap. 'What section's the book in, you twat.'This joke is terribly unfair on librarians, because any literate person knows that there is no rule saying that you can't end a sentence with a preposition. It is, as Shakespeare put it, such stuff as dreams are made on. Yet it remains one of those errors that flesh is heir to.That there is no such rule should be obvious to any English speaker. How would you go about using a phrasal verb in the imperative? 'Out look!' you would scream. 'Down get! On we're being fired!'Referees would say 'On play.' Off would take planes. And nobody would be allowed to sleep in.No grammarian supports this wild rule. Fowler calls it a \"superstition\". Bernstein said that anyone who propounded it didn't have a leg on which to stand. Winston Churchill, who knew his way around a sentence, said it was the kind of nonsense up with which he would not put.So why, you may ask, is it such a common misconception? Why do so many fools, however inconsistently, assert that there is such a rule? Did they just make up it?Not exactly.The rule is utterly unfairly blamed on a chap called Robert Lowth. Lowth was an eighteenth century scholar of ancient languages who believed that it was rather silly that schoolboys learnt their grammar from Latin and that it would be easier for everybody if they learnt English grammar first. So he wrote A Short Introduction to English Grammar. This book is much and misleadingly cited. But for you, dear reader, for you I sat down yesterday and read it cover to cover*.Here is the actual section on prepositions, and it's well worth reading the whole thing.PREPOSITIONS have Government of Cases; and in English they always require the Objective Case after them: as, \"with him; from her, to me.\"The Preposition is often separated from the Relative which it governs and joined to the Verb at the end of the Sentence, or of some member of it: as, \"Horace is an author, whom I am much delighted with.\" \"The world is too well bred to shock authors with a truth, which generally their booksellers are the first that inform them of.\" This is an Idiom which our language is strongly inclined to; it prevails in common conversation, and suits very well with the familiar style in writing;[Any objections so far, dear reader? Notice the \"strongly inclined to\"?]but the placing of the Preposition before the Relative is more graceful as well as more perspicuous; and agrees much better with the solemn and elevated Style.[That's it. Doesn't sound like a rule to me. It's a little stylistic tip for a particular kind of writing. And just to show that he understood, I shall quote further.]...But in English the Preposition is more frequently placed after the Verb, and separate from it like an Adverb; in which Situation it is no less apt to affect the Sense of it, and to give it a new Meaning; and may still be considered as belonging to the Verb, and a part of it. As to cast is to throw;  but to cast up, or to compute, an account, is quite a different thing: thus to fall on, to bear out, to give over &c. So that the Meaning of the Verb, and the Propriety of the Phrase, depend upon the Preposition subjoined.I can't tell whether it is more foolish that that little half-sentence has been taken up by generations of fatuous pedants as an iron law of English, or that for a stylistic suggestion poor Lowth has become the object of so many grammarians' scorn.Lowth's book has also been blamed for the (utterly fatuous) idea that you can't split an infinitive, which he doesn't mention once. In fact, he toddles along merrily beginning sentences with Ands and Buts and being a good clear writer of English.So Lowth is less read than condemned. And next time anybody tells you that you can't end a sentence with a preposition, tell them to off piss.Not Guilty*The title doesn't lie. It's very, very short."},

And why not trump both with the extreme of hadopelagic which derives from Hades and refers to those strange canyons that loiter beneath the abyss, filled with Krakens, cabinet ministers and cast off ideas for Inky Fool posts?Which is all the excuse I need to quote The Kraken by TennysonBelow the thunders of the upper deep;Far, far beneath in the abysmal sea, His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleepThe Kraken sleepeth: faintest sunlights fleeAbout his shadowy sides: above him swellHuge sponges of millennial growth and height; And far away into the sickly light, From many a wondrous grot and secret cellUnnumbered and enormous polypiWinnow with giant arms the slumbering green.There hath he lain for ages and will lieBattening upon huge sea-worms in his sleep,Until the latter fire shall heat the deep;Then once by man and angels to be seen,In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die.Which is how I feel when I have to get up early in the morning. (I must do something about the unnumbered and enormous polypi in my bedroom. I'll begin by numbering them).Incidentally, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea does not refer to depth. A French league is about four kilometers, so that would be 80,000 km or 50,000 miles. As the earth's diameter is a bit under 8,000 miles, that would mean that Captain Nemo et al would be out the other side and floating around in space. But Jules Verne was not talking about depth, he was still harping on about travelling around the world. The point of the book is that the Nautilus can travel long distances (about twice round the earth) without rising to the surface.Even more abstrusely (and I promise I'll stop after this), in A Midsummer Night's Dream Oberon sends puck to fetch an ingredient for a love potion and adds:Fetch me this herb; and be thou here againEre the leviathan can swim a leagueTo which Puck replies:I'll put a girdle round about the earthIn forty minutes.This tell us two things. First, as the English league is three miles and Puck understands this to be forty minutes we can calculate the leviathan's top speed as being four and half miles per hours, which is about jogging pace and Not Very Impressive. However, as the circumference of the earth is just under 25,000 miles Puck has a top speed of about 37,000 mph, which is more than forty-nine times the speed of sound.The Inky Fool takes a cruise"},

{"title": "Homer Among the Postmoderns", "date": "Friday 21 May 2010", "text": "Here is a postmodern metaphor. It's taken from Richard Brautigan's Trout Fishing in America:The sun was a like a huge 50 cent piece that someone had poured kerosene on and lit with a match and said 'Here, hold this while I go get a newspaper' and put the coin in my hand, but never came back.It's postmodern, you see, because it's got lots of utterly unnecessary details like the match and the newspaper that don't help to describe the sun. It just keeps scuttling along for its own sake. This is in sharp contradiction to how metaphors used to be used. Here is Homer describing a chap called Simoisius being stabbed:...he was cut off untimely by the spear of mighty Ajax, who struck him in the breast by the right nipple as he was coming on among the foremost fighters; the spear went right through his shoulder, and he fell as a poplar that has grown straight and tall in a meadow by some mere, and its top is thick with branches. Then the wheelwright lays his axe to its roots that he may fashion a felloe for the wheel of some goodly chariot, and it lies seasoning by the waterside. Which goes to show that time has no dominion and there is nothing new under the sun. The great thing about Homer is that there are so many translations that you can put poets into the ring and force them to fight for you amusement. Above was Samuel Butler's prose translation. Here is the same passage in Alexander Pope's version:Short was his date! by dreadful Ajax slain,He falls, and renders all their cares in vain!So falls a poplar, that in watery groundRaised high the head, with stately branches crown'd,(Fell'd by some artist with his shining steel,To shape the circle of the bending wheel,)Cut down it lies, tall, smooth, and largely spread,With all its beauteous honours on its headThere, left a subject to the wind and rain,And scorch'd by suns, it withers on the plainThus pierced by Ajax, Simoisius liesStretch'd on the shore, and thus neglected dies.And here it is in Chapman's Homer (which Keats first looked into):Cut off with mighty Ajax' lance ; for, as his spirit put on, He strook him at his breast's right pap, quite through his shoulder-bone, And in the dust of earth he fell, that was the fruitful soil Of his friends' hopes; but where he sow'd he buried all his toil. And as a poplar shot aloft, set by a river side,  In moist edge of a mighty fen, his head in curls implied, But all his body plain and smooth, to which a wheelwright puts The sharp edge of his shining axe, and his soft timber cuts From his innative root, in hope to hew out of his bole The fell'ffs, or out-parts of a wheel, that compass in the whole,  To serve some goodly chariot; but, being big and sad, And to be hal'd home through the bogs, the useful hope he had Sticks there, and there the goodly plant lies with'ring out his grace: So lay, by Jove-bred Ajax' hand, Anthemion's forward race...Generally, I prefer Chapman's version; but I think in this passage the Twickenham dwarf wins by a nose.The Inky Fool contemplating a hair cut"},

In exasperation you puff out your cheeks, then you blow the air outwards, perhaps biting your lower lip and making an ffff sound. The whole sound could be transcribed as huff, hence being in a huff. The first ever person to be tetchy was Juliet (as in Romeo). Her wet nurse decided to wean Juliet by putting wormwood oil on her breast. Wormwood is one of the bitterest tastes in the world and the poor baby did not like it:For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;My lord and you were then at Mantua:--Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,When it did taste the wormwood on the nippleOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!Incidentally, wormwood has nothing to do with either worms or wood. If you put wormwood into alcohol a chemical called thujone is released which is a rather effective painkiller.

It was a reasonably standard Roman punishment*. And He's not necessarily saying that you should tie a millstone round someone's neck, only that it might have been better for him in the long run.In fact, Jesus didn't say large millstone either.

It has loitered in the foul alleys of management jargon; it has kept company with mechanics and disgraced itself in the beds of lifestyle consultants. It has been aesthetically debauched.Surfeit, on the other hand, has an ancient and regal feel. Henry V, upon his father's death, turned his newly monarchical eye on Falstaff and said:I know thee not, old man. Fall to thy prayers.How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!I have long dreamt of such a kind of man,So surfeit-swell'd, so old, and so profane;But being awak'd, I do despise my dream.That's the kind of company that surfeit has been keeping. It is a grand word, a word and a slayer of kings. The intemperate King Michael of Poland died of a surfeit of gherkins, which is one hell of a way of sidling into eternity. King Henry I of England perished in France from a surfeit of lampreys. Perishing in France used to be an awkward habit of English kings, so Henry's body was sewn up inside the skin of a bull and taken to Reading.So enough of the overload overload, dear reader, and bring on a superabundance of surfeits.Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,Or gluttoning on all, or all away.Death to the Polish!N.B. Given my usual cruelty to the ladies and gentlemen of the press, it should perhaps be noted that the drowsy originator of this post was a journalist."},
{"title": "All mimsy were the polka-dots", "date": "Sunday 16 May 2010", "text": "Fashion designer Bella Freud does not “do knitted polka-dots, because they can look a bit naff and mimsy”, I learned from the Sunday Telegraph’s Stella magazine today; while yesterday’s Times suggested that Old Etonians or Wets* who failed to capitalise on their early advantages were “mimsy gits and no mistake”.Until this year, I had never heard the word “mimsy” in relation to anything other than Lewis Carroll or Jabberwocky**. But now it seems to be everywhere, a useful term of contempt which broadsheet columnists can apply to anything from “well-mannered” books and films, through political correctness, to sorbet-coloured cardigans, the Lake District, Sophie Dahl, femininity and rugby union. In fact, it was a review of Sophie Dahl’s new television series by Simon Hoggart in The Spectator that drew my attention to the resurgence of the word to imply “a certain sort of self-conscious prettiness”.The OED defines it as \"prim; careful; affected; feeble, weak, lightweight\" - quite distinct from Carroll's original sense of something between miserable and flimsy. Interestingly, it has been in use in this sense since the late nineteenth century, but it seems to have recently experienced a surge in popularity - perhaps because there has been an explosion in mimsiness, or in anti-mimsy sentiment among the grumpier sort of journalist.But even without a dictionary definition, there is something about the word which makes it peculiarly easy to understand. Its combination of letters suggests “prIM”, “sIMpering”, “tIMid”, “MIlksop”, “MIlquetoast”, “MuMSY” and “MIddle-brow” or “MIddle-class”, and there are shades of all of these in the way the word is used – although at the most general level it might best be defined as weak and ineffectual, or pretty in a twee, girly sort of way. Based on this reading, Cath Kidston is the epitome of mimsy (and I write as someone who earlier today squealed in no doubt mimsy delight after discovering two Cath Kidston cushions under a pile of junk in my bedroom). Expensive cupcakes with pastel-coloured icing are extremely mimsy. So, I suspect, is anything by Emma Bridgewater (all those polka dots), and Laura Ashley. \"Mimsy\" is not the only word from Jabberwocky to have survived. The others include:Chortle (\"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!’ He chortled in his joy\") - Another portmanteau word, invented by combining \"chuckle\" and \"snort\". Still used in the same sense. Burble (\"The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame/ Came whiffling through the tulgey wood/And burbled as it came\") - This had been around since the fourteenth century, when it was a noun meaning bubble (later taking on the additional sense of \"pimple\"). But it was Lewis Carroll who introduced the current sense of \"a murmorous flow of words\" (n), or to emit such a noise (v), by combining \"bleat\", \"murmur\" and \"warble\" - although I think there is some reference to \"babble\" there as well.Galumph (\"He left it dead, and with its head/ He went galumphing back\") - The meaning of this word has changed slightly since Carroll invented it, combining \"gallop\" and \"triumphant\" to create a word meaning \"to march on exultingly with irregular bounding movements\". Now the OED defines it as \"to bound or move clumsily or noisily\" - possibly by association with \"clump\" or \"clumsy\".A polka-dot Aga Dogberry is watching the cricket* This term appears to refer to someone who, like our new Deputy Prime Minister, went to Westminster School. It sounds improbable, but no more so than Old Wok.** “Mimsy”, first applied to “borogoves”, was a portmanteau word invented by Lewis Carroll by combining “miserable” and “flimsy”."},
{"title": "Pasteur Pedicular", "date": "Saturday 15 May 2010", "text": "A rubbish joke:A woman tells her doting husband that she wishes to bathe in milk. 'Whatever you ask, darling,' says her husband. 'Would you like it pasteurised?'.'No. Just up to my chin.'Which does nothing but illustrate how little shifts of pronunciation can cloud things. Pasteurised is, of course, named after Louis Pasteur. Yet we pronounce his name pa-stir. With his milky method we have longened the A and added in a Y to make it past-yer. Perhaps, perhaps our pronunciation has been skewed by a dream of cows in pasture. I couldn't say for sure.The curious thing is that because of that slight shift you can use the word pasteurised without ever noticing that it must be named after the famous chemist. You see it the second you consider the word, but how often do any of us consider anything? I feel certain I don't. I am a man of wild and imponderable action. Thoughts are for losers.Put the stress back on the middle syllable of excellent, and you can see how it relates to excel and repel and repellent. Not that that should come as a cataclysmic surprise, merely that the connection was loitering in a dusky corner. By Shakespeare's time excellent had already become a cretic. But it still meant exceeding, rather than praiseworthy as we can tell from Queen Margaret's ever-so-slightly-catty remark to Elizabeth of York:From forth the kennel of thy womb hath creptA hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,That foul defacer of God's handiwork,That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.Women, eh? (I have an idea for a line of greetings-cards, as a competitor to Clinton's. On the outside of a card I'd have CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR BABY!!!!! !!! and on the inside I would reprint that passage. Any takers?)As with pasteurised and excellent, lousy is obviously to do with lice, but how often do you think of that when using the word? The slight shift from the unvoiced S to the Z of lau-zee means that we never think of our diminutive neighbours. Louse-ridden has retained a pure and powerful punch. Lousy has lost meaning and must be replaced. Luckily such a word exists: pedicular. Pedicular (which was suggested to me by an erudite reader) means 'of, pertaining to, or caused by lice'. Pedicular is the thinking man's lousy.A lousy picture, or a pedicular one"},
{"title": "Druthers and Tar Babies", "date": "Friday 14 May 2010", "text": "There are precisely a million and one little differences between American and British English. The Inky Fool once had to go on the run after stubbing out a fag butt in San Francisco. Here for the sake of mutual comprehension and edification are two strange and wayward usages from that strange and wayward continent:A couple of days ago I got an e-mail from deepest, darkest America* that concluded:If I had my druthers, each day would consist of 36 long hours. But some asshole stole my druthers.Now the first thing I thought was obviously that he'd misspelled arsehole. The second thing I thought was that in ancient Rome the day was divided into twelve hours from dawn till dusk, which meant that during the summer an hour was actually longer. And then I noticed that I have no idea what druthers are. A split google later I discovered that it's a shortening of would rather (to 'drather to druther) and is an exclusively American phrase meaning preference. The first recorded use is in an 1870 story called Centrepole Bill and goes:If I was a youngster, I 'drather set up in any perfession but a circus-driver, but a man can't always have his 'drathers.Which explains something, but not the spelling of Centrepole.The second reason that I was considering odd Americanisms was a question on the Dear Dogberry page which I recently set up as a kind of agony aunt column. The question concerned an article in The Guardian by the bleeding-heart left-winger Norman Tebbit. He referred to the coalition between Tory and Liberal thus:A marriage of convenience between those two political tar babies hugging each other to death might make an enjoyable spectacle, but the consequences for the country will be baleful.Which is all well and good, but nobody in England knows what a tar baby is**. Well, children, once upon a time there was a fox and the fox wanted to kill a rabbit. So the fox took the obvious route of making a baby out of tar and putting a hat on it. The rabbit came past saw the tar baby and said hello. When the tar baby didn't reply the rabbit flew into a rage and attacked it, but as tar is sticky the rabbit became stuck. The more the rabbit tried to extricate himself the more trapped he became. This story is of doubtful validity at best and there are naturalists who go so far as to dismiss it out of hand. It was a folk tale told in the plantations of the Deep South and was collected by a chap called Joel Chandler Harris and put into his Uncle Remus book. As the whole point of tar babies is that they are inanimate it is hard to see how they could hug each other to death. There may even be a hint of a mixed metaphor somewhere between the married and homicidal babies. There are Americans who believe the term to be racist. Americans can detect racism in the way that a compulsive gambler can detect that he'll be lucky today. There is a whole Wikipedia page devoted to Controversies about the word \"niggardly\". So now we know about tar babies, but Americans don't know about Norman Tebbit. One country is the winner here, but I'm not sure which.Norman Tebbit addressing a Guardian-reader*I have never been to Williamsburg VA but imagine it to be both profound and gloomy.** This assertion is based on my having conducted a rigorous survey of several people."},

When he had finished writing a page he would remove it from the typewriter, read it over and pin it to the pinboard. If he thought it was a Good Page he would pin it near the top and if he thought it was a Bad Page he would pin it near the bottom.When he had finished the novel he would take the lowest page from the pinboard, rewrite it and pin it back up. He would keep doing this until all the pages were bunched near the top like coconuts on a palm tree. Then he would take them all down, put them in order, and post them to his publisher.This seems like a rather good idea."},

So a post on lovable women.Harlots are of uncertain origin (see this article). The word appears to have originally meant vagrant and Chaucer used the word to describe jugglers. There's a story that when Jean Harlow mispronounced Margot Asquith's name, Margot corrected her saying 'The T is silent, as in Harlow', but that may not be true.Prostitutes are not, as I once fondly imagined, women who stand in for (pro stituo) wives, they are women who stand in front of brothels.Strumpet rhymes with trumpet and crumpet, that is the main reason for the word [limericks in the comments please, and if you don't like it you can lump it]. Nobody's quite sure where the word comes from, but it may have influenced guitars:TO STRUM: to have carnal knowledge of a woman, also to play badly on the harpsichord or any other stringed instrument. [Capt. Francis Grose, \"A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue,\" 1796] Whore is a cutting indictment of the sexism of our language, or rather amusing, depending on you point of view. Once upon a time (approximately 6,000 years ago) people buried each other in pits and loved one another, an action they called *qar. They invaded India and wrote the Kama Sutra. They invaded Italy, became Roman and called each other carus or dear, then they caressed and cherished their dear ones, cherie, and were charitable towards them. Some of the pit-burying lovers invaded Germany and started pronouncing C as H (car to har) so they fucked whores*.There isn't much good prose in Anglo-Saxon. There are a few wonderful poems. The Wanderer, Seafarer, Ruin, Wife's Lament and  Beowulf are beautiful. Prose-wise Anglo-Saxon's a bunch of crap. Alfric's colloquies are insanely inane. His Preface to Genesis is worse; and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle exalts upon plateaus of tedium never dreamt of by wet paint. Therefore, to fill out the prose section of any Anglo-Saxon course people insist upon teaching you Cynewulf and Cyneheard, the only almost interesting part of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Basically a chap killed another chap while he was visiting a prostitute. Unfortunately for posterity and teachers of Anglo-Saxon this murder was so bloody exciting that for most of the story the chronicler forgets to mention which one is which. It's all \"They said 'Come out\" and they said 'No you come out.' Then they came out and they saw them and they killed the them that was they.\" [I had to do a damned exam on this]However, to be fair to the chronicler he did say that he [Cynewulf] was : \"wīfcȳþþe on Merantūne\"Wif [wife] meant woman and cȳþþe [pronounced coother] meant intimacy.We were instructed to translate wīfcȳþþe on Merantūne as \"wenching in Merton\". I'm glad that we were. I am glad to have written the word wenching at least once. Things have changed in Merton. It's just a part of South London. There's no stockade there anymore and I've just discovered that, according to Merton Borough Council's website, the main reason for visiting the place is now the community toilet scheme.*Before I get beaten to death by an enraged mob of philologists, I should point out that my fixing on the Kurgan pit-burial culture and my use of the word invade are both decisions based on caprice and whimsy.P.S. I know I mentioned prostitutes last week. I shall try and keep off the sex trade for a while. It's all David Blunkett's fault.P.P.S.

{"title": "Idiopathic", "date": "Tuesday 11 May 2010", "text": "Idiopathic is an immensely useful word meaning that you've got no idea what the hell is happening. It's a medical term and is there to allow bewildered doctors to conceal their bewilderment. Technically it means of an unknown or obscure cause. So when you turn up at the clinic and explain to the doctor that your pulse is down your glands are up and your right foot's fallen off, rather than saying 'Blimey, I'm flummoxed' the doctor can smile wisely and say 'Hmm, how idiopathic.'So never again, dear reader! Never again need you admit that you don't understand something. Idiopathy can maintain you in intellectual comfort forever. Failed guesses, bankruptcies, freak election results and unsuccessful seductions can all be dismissed as idiopathic.You might even add in the word exucontian, meaning out of nothing. It's a theological word, but along with idiopathic is useful for explaining car crashes to the police.I only know of idiopathic because a doctor friend of mine once told me that I had a strange dark patch on my eyeball. He examined my other eye and found it there too. We worried and fretted about it for a few minutes before he calmly concluded that I had idiopathic eyes and left it at that. I started to feel Miltonic and Homeric and considered morosely that my light was spent. Later I remembered that I wear contact lenses.Idiopathic"},
{"title": "The Music of Abuse", "date": "Monday 10 May 2010", "text": "As the Inky Fool continues to shuffle unconvincingly through the outskirts of relevance, something should perhaps be made of Nick Clegg's love of Samuel Beckett, which is odd as I previously pointed out that Samuel appeared to working for the Tories. Anyway, it's reason enough for a little look at this loving exchange:Estragon: That's the idea, let's abuse each other.They turn, move apart, turn again and face each other.Vladimir: Moron!Estragon: Vermin!Vladimir: Abortion!Estragon: Morpion!Vladimir: Sewer-rat!Estragon: Curate!Vladimir: Cretin!Estragon: (with finality). Crritic!Vladimir: Oh!He wilts, vanquished, and turns away.The thing about Waiting For Godot is that nobody comes, nobody goes, and the whole play has to survive on the beauty of the writing, the music of the exchanges. Here, for example, all the insults are related by sound. It's almost like one of those puzzles where you get from one word to another by changing a letter at a time: fool pool poll pole pope. This is quite obvious is the curate cretin critic group but also lingers subtly in the on-in ortion-orpion or-ewer rat-rate. So the poor curate is only thrown in as a bridge from sewer-rat to cretin. At least I imagine that that's the reason. Cretin derives from the word Christian. This was not because Christians were considered stupid, but because the dribbling and insane, the window-lickers and the chronically bewildered were nonetheless fellow Christians, in the same way we would insist that they are human beings too. So often was our common Christianity stressed that the term became abusive. All words for mental illness, however clinical or kind, grow up to be insults.The harmony of words must also be the reason morpions get a mention. A morpion is a pubic louse*. If you didn't know that, don't worry. It's the French for pubic louse. This could make sense. You see Beckett originally wrote the play in French and called it En Attendant Godot. He then rewrote it a couple of years later in English. The exchange above was not in the original. It was added to the English version; hence, presumably, the reference to crritic.By the rules of the game, if Estragon had said pubic louse, Vladimir would have had to reply with public house and that wouldn't have worked at all. The game is not easy: here's an attempt of my own:You: Inky!Me: Donkey!You: Dunce!Me: Bouncer!You: Butcher!Me: Belcher!You: Felcher!Me: Filth!You: Fool!*As an utterly unlinguistic aside: pubic lice and head lice are different species. This is not true of apes which, covered in hair, have but one form of louse wandering all over their bodies. By studying the genomes of the head louse and morpion one can work out how long the species have been diverging for and therefore how long ago humans became hairless. I forget the figure, but adore the methodology.P.S. The picture at the top right may have inspired the whole play."},
{"title": "The Generous Haystack And The Crooked-Nosed Robber-Chieftan", "date": "Sunday 9 May 2010", "text": "The Clegg family motto is, apparently, \"Qui potest capere capiat\", which means \"Let him take what he can get\".That is as far as the Inky Fool's political analysis goes. There was an old Norse word kleggi that meant haystack. So far as anybody can tell (and opinions are hung) there was a place in Lancashire called Haystack Hill that was therefore called Clegg and the name of the village survived even when the hill's name was changed to Owl. People from Clegg were called Clegg.Meanwhile there was an Scottish chap who suffered a broken nose. The Gaelic for nose is shron and the Gaelic for crooked is cam, so this chap became known as Crooked-Nose, Cam-shron, or Cameron. He had children who had children who had children in a huge teleological domino-run of parturition that led inevitably to the current leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party.In 1169 some Englishman invaded Ireland. Why they did this I can't imagine, but they did and they got a little bit of territory. Territory is best marked out with stakes (steaks don't work) and the Latin for stake is palus and so such territory is called a pale. So the territory around Dublin was called The Pale and everything else was Irish and beyond The Pale.Anyway, the English rampaged about, driving innocent Irishmen from their ancestral peat-bogs. These innocent Irishman found that in their straitened and vagabond conditions innocence no longer paid and many turned to banditry. They became thieves, or to give the proper Irish word tories.The word tory found its way into English as a pejorative term for an Irish Catholic. The English were mostly protestant with a protestant king called Charles II who died and was replaced by James II who was (like Mrs Malaprop) of the Roman Obedience. James II was not simply Catholic, he also appeared to have plans to give his Irish Catholic henchmen their land back and so his supporters were insultingly called Tories.The Tories did all right for a while. They didn't get to keep James II, who was ousted in the Glorious Revolution; but they stuck around well into the eighteenth century until they were wiped out by the Whigs. In the late eighteenth century the Whigs themselves split and one faction, the Friends of Pitt, were insultingly referred to as Tories. Everybody had by this time forgotten that tory meant thief. The term essentially meant \"You're like those people from a hundred years ago that we wiped out\". Even in 1812 when they were in government they preferred to call themselves Whigs. They were the true Whigs in the way that the Real IRA consider themselves real. (I'm more frightened of the surreal IRA). Then in 1834 there was the Tamworth Manifesto and they decided to call themselves Conservatives and the name became official. Tory has always been an insult. Indeed, the posters in this election campaign saying \"I've never voted Tory before but...\" were the first official posters ever to use the word.As liberal means generous, all of this necessarily implies that the generous haystack is currently in talks with the crooked-nose chief of the robbers.Meanwhile, labour, as any mother will tell you, is agony and is best survived on drugs.The Inky Fool casts his vote"},

{"title": "Ballots and Balls", "date": "Friday 7 May 2010", "text": "Ballot comes from the Venetian word ballotte, which means small balls. Indeed, the term arrived on English shores inside The Historie of Italie by William Thomas. The idea was that you could cast votes by placing different coloured balls (or pebbles) into a bag. This idea leads back to ancient Athens. If the Athenians wanted to banish somebody for not being classical enough, they would vote on the question by putting little black or white fragments of pottery in a box. White meant yes: black no. These tiles were called ostrakons. Hence ostracism. Ostracism has nothing to do with ostriches but is distantly related to oysters (both words relate to bone).The first verbing of ostracism was in this apt couplet by Andrew Marvell:Therefore the democratic stars did rise,And all that worth from hence did ostracize.The method and term survives to this day in blackballing. In the gentlemen's clubs of London an application for membership may be refused on the basis of a single black ball in the ballot box. In ancient Syracuse votes for banishment did not use shards of pottery. They used olive leaves and so ostracism was called petalismos, which is far more beautiful.A brown ballot box containing balls, darling."},

{"title": "Sausage Poison In Your Face", "date": "Wednesday 5 May 2010", "text": "Botuliform, dear reader, means sausage-shaped, and if you can't drop it into conversation in the next twenty-four hours then you're not having the right kind of conversations. Botuliform comes from botulus in Latin meaning sausage. Sausages are stuffed with pork and peril. Too often the sausage is the last refuge of rotten meat. This culinary truth was not lost upon the Swabian poet Justinus Kerner. When not writing Swabian poetry (and everyone needs the occasional break) Justinus Kerner was a doctor. He once wrote of his twin vocations that: Flüchtig leb' ich durchs Gedicht,Durch des Arztes Kunst nur flüchtig;Nur wenn man von Geistern spricht,Denkt man mein noch und schimpft tüchtig.Which the Inky Fool's indentured linguist Everet Lapel translates thus:I live briefly through the poem,Only briefly through the doctor’s arts:Only when one speaks of ghostsDoes one yet think of me and curse me.However, this is no longer true. Only when one speaks of sausage-poison does one ever consider Justinus Kerner. This is because in 1817 he identified a rather horrible disease you got from rotten meat and decided to call it sausage-disease, or botulism. He named the guilty chemical sausage-poison or botulinum toxin.In 1895 there was a funeral in Belgium where ham was served and three people dropped dead, which must have delighted the undertakers. The homicidal ham was rushed to Emile Pierre van Ermengem who was Professor of Bacteria at Ghent University and he identified clostridium botulinum, which are the bacteria that make botulinum toxin. This was useful as you could now produce botulinum toxin and take as much of it as you wanted.Botulinum toxin is, generally speaking, a bad thing. It slowly paralyses you until you die. If you drink just one microgram then you're going to join the majority. But if you take an awful lot less than that you only get a tinsy winsy bit paralysed. So if you're having muscle spasms a doctor can temporarily cure you by injecting botulinum toxin. Also, if you're old and ugly you can inject sausage-poison straight into your old ugly face, paralyse your muscles and temporarily look a bit younger and very, very odd. Of course you don't call it sausage-poison. You'd hardly be able to market that. You wouldn't be able to invite people to sausage-poison parties. You don't even call it botulinum toxin. You call it botox.Now go forth and use the word botuliform.Every time I try to self-administer botox the same thing happens"},

Richard the Lionheart, Charles The Fat and Louis The Sluggard were far more memorable monarchs than the modern, numbered variety. Wars, which used to be named after roses or Captain Jenkins’ stray body-parts, are now dully geographical: Afghan, Iraq, Falklands. However strongly we may now feel on the subject, can you imagine a schoolchild of the future getting excited over the Second Iraq War?It is almost indisputable that the voter apathy that afflicts modern politics is down to the fact that we don’t give our parliaments memorable names any more.We used to. There was the Rump Parliament, which was all that was left after Cromwell had forced out those MPs who didn’t want the king violently shortened. There was the Parliament of Dunces in 1404 from which lawyers were banned (presently the legal profession makes up about 10% of MPs). There was the Addled Parliament of 1614, which was dissolved without doing anything at all. And there was the Parliament of Bats in 1426 where the members were banned from carrying swords and so carried clubs instead.Many of the names are a trifle misleading. The Pacific Parliament was not oceanic but peace-making. The Barebones Parliament (pulled from the Rump) was in fact convened by a puritan called Praise-God Barebone*. The Insane Parliament of 1258 is probably just a misreading of Insigne. But the Drunken Parliament of 1661 did exactly what it said on the tin.And our current legislature? It is the 54th Parliament and by that name history will forget it, unless we move fast.Tony Wright, the Labour MP, suggested last May that they might be remembered as the Moat or Manure Parliament and there was a sterling effort, mainly by The Times, to make the Manure stick, yet by June it was pretty much forgotten.

{"title": "Immerd", "date": "Friday 30 April 2010", "text": "Immerd is a terribly useful word that the OED demurely defines as To bury or cover in ordure (1635). It therefore functions as a polite way of saying \"in the shit\", as in \"If my parole officer catches me I'll be immerded\" or \"I can't talk now, I'm immerded in work.\"The OED cites two only usages. The first is from a sermon by William Ames entitled The Saint's Security against Seducing Spirits, which runs \"Do we... see some eminent professor... immerd himself in the dung of worldly wisdom\", to which the answer is yes.The second comes from Robert Browning, whom I had always considered strangely prudish. It's in an obscure poem of his called Aristophanes' Apology (1875). Aristophanes says of those whom he satirises The only drawback to which huge delight [...]Why, 'tis that, make a muckheap of a man,There, pillared by your prowess, he remains,Immortally immerded.The word comes straight from the French merde, meaning ordure. And the French have an antonym, démerder, which due to their lax morals they are prepared to use in  political speeches. During the Nazi occupation of France Charles De Gaulle addressed the French nation by radio in a rousing speech that ended thus:Françaises, Français, vous avez de la merde jusqu'au cou. Mais moi, qui suis plus grand que vous, je n'en ai que jusqu'aux genoux. Alors, Françaises, Français, démerdez-vous!Which translates loosely as: Frenchwomen, Frenchmen, you are up to your necks in shit. But I, who am bigger than you, am only up to my knees in it. So, Frenchwomen, Frenchmen, unshit yourselves!     Potty-mouth"},
{"title": "Wales and Bad English", "date": "Thursday 29 April 2010", "text": "Two points about Wales. First: it doesn't have a name. Wales comes from wealh and means foreign, in the same way that a walnut is a foreign nut because walnut trees were not native to England. Wales simply means foreign country. It is an exonym. The Welsh word for Wales is Cymru, which comes from the Brythonic word combrogi meaning land of our compatriots. So the English call it \"Their Country\" and the Welsh call it \"Our Country\", which means that the floor is wide open for somebody to think up an actual name for Permanentlyrainingland.Second: when I was young and easy and doing my GCSEs, I used have to write preposterous translations. No awkwardness of the other language (French, German or Latin) could be omitted. Frenchmen were forever \"at the house of\" other Frenchmen, Romans were always doing things \"in order that they might\" do something else in the subjunctive (which seemed unfair). I would carefully write out crimes against English prose like \"The about to be killed legionaries saw the having been crossed river\".I can still (for some reason) recite some of my Latin set texts, which I, like everybody else, memorised in English:At that time appeared in the palace a sign miraculous in both appearance and outcome. They say that while a boy slept, whose name was Servius Tullius, his head burnt with a divine fire; and they say that, a great shout having arisen, the king...In today's Independent there is the story of an unfortunate potholer whose troglodyte corpse has finally been dragged to the light after thirty years in the underworld. A spokeswoman for Dyfed Powys Police said: \"Although he was located at that time in the caves, his body was never able to be recovered despite several attempts over the following weeks and as a result he has remained in the location he died.\" There's something fantastic about \"his body was never able to be recovered\". It ascribes will and inability to a cadaver, but a will to be the subject of a passive verb. Located is fantastically ambiguous because you don't know whether it means \"was there\" or that his whereabouts were known. I stubbornly refuse to believe that anybody, even a policeman, could invent such a byzantine and grotesque sentence. The spokesman must have been speaking Welsh, or Latin.All signs in Wales are bilingual, so English speakers who erect them have to e-mail a translator for a Welsh rendering. But translators go on holiday. The lower half of this sign reads “I am not in the office at the moment. Send any work to be translated”."},
{"title": "Bigot", "date": "Wednesday 28 April 2010", "text": "The main theory (though there are several) on the origin of the word bigot, is that it derives from the words by God. The idea was that those who were always invoking their morality and piety were in fact rather nasty and hypocritical.Any connection this etymology may have to current events is purely coincidental.N.B. The Inky Fool is non-party political and believes in government by whim.Much Ado About Nothing toddles along in a jolly Shakesperean-comedy sort of way. It's all terribly gentle and fluffy. Then there's a misunderstanding at a wedding which leads Benedick to ask Beatrice whether she's fallen out with Claudio. To which she replies I would eat his heart in the marketplace.And bang! You have one of the foulest images in all of Shakespeare. More efficient than anything in Titus Andronicus, more horrid than anything in Lear. One sentence: I would eat his hearth in the marketplace.Eating somebody's heart is a pretty nasty idea. For a lady like Beatrice who has so far been pretty ladylike, it's astonishing. You picture her, blood dribbling down her chin as she munches aorta over the opened corpse of Claudio. I can't think of a single line anywhere else in English literature that changes the tone so quickly*. It's like the zero-zero ejector seat, which a pilot can use even when the plane is stationary on the ground. He can sit in the cockpit drowsily humming a tune to himself and watching the flowers grow, then touch a button and a bomb explodes beneath his seat and he is sent hurtling into the sky.Eating somebody's heart is pretty hideous, but the line wouldn't have the same effect, we would not picture it so clearly, were it not in the marketplace. Because it's in the marketplace, we see the cannibalism. Because it's in the marketplace, we realise that this is not a figure of speech but a plan, a plan with a location.Shakespeare was all technique. Every good idea he had he used again. After Hamlet has killed Polonius, Claudius says to Laertes (Polonius' son):Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,To show yourself your father's son in deedMore than in words?And Laertes repliesTo cut his throat i' the church.I hear that line and think to myself: \"Done that one before, Will. Slightly better the first time, but good effort, Will, good effort.\" It works: violence is twice as vivid with a location attached. Slitting people's throats is a commonplace threat. I have heard respectable and peaceable matrons complain of some minor annoyance and add \"Oh I could slit his throat.\" They don't mean it and I don't picture it. It is a figure of speech, no more to be taken literally than the strange evolution implicit in \"Son of a bitch\", or the eternal agony and torture wished for in \"Damn him.\"But add a location, preferably an inappropriate one like a church or a marketplace, and the image revives, the threat is precise, we see the knife cutting the skin, or the teeth breaking the ventricles. And all by simply appending to the threat a single, simple clause.\"I'll kill you.\" - Not that frightening.\"I'll kill you on Tuesday.\" - Ooh.A technique, dear reader: a technique to be learned and used.While we are on the subject of hearts, heart strings (which are so often tugged) are real. Medical fellows call them chordae tendineae, because medical fellows will do anything to avoid speaking English. If anyone ever did tug on your heart strings, you would die. They might also get stuck between Beatrice's teeth.Label on the upper right*Although you are welcome to nominate a rival in the comments.P.S. I got glared at furiously by a passing lady on Saturday just because I happened to observe to a friend that the best way to a girl's heart was keyhole surgery."},

Everything, I suppose. I said, \"Bunnies?\" and the synonym appeared to console her. \"Bunnies,\" she said decisively and continued.That was years ago, but the other day in Regents Park I was with a friend watching ducks dabbling. A mallard resurfaced and I pointed and said \"You know the water comes off that duck's back like water off a duck's back.\" These little things keep me afloat. The duck dived again and, gazing at its disappearing bottom, I was reminded of the word pseudaposematic.Have you ever wondered why mallards have those little squares of blue on their sides? No? Didn't think so. They are not there for ornamentation for the mallard is not a vain creature.Those speculum markings are there so that if you creep up on a mallard from behind you see a big, angry fish staring at you:This is the reason that mallards are almost never the victims of sexual abuse*; their bottoms look like angry fish. The mallard protects its bottom by disguising it as something that would make you run away. There ought to be an easier way of saying that, there ought to be one baroque word meaning disguised as something to make you go away: and there is. The mallard, dear reader, has a pseudaposematic arse.Pseud because it's fraudulent, apo because that's Greek for away (like an apostle who is sent away), and sematic because it's a sign (like semaphore). There's a lot of it about in nature. You have, as like as not, run away from a wasp that is actually a yellow and black striped fly (the difference is something to do with whether the wings are crossed). There are venomless snakes in the bright colours of their poisonous cousins. There are moths with eyes.But the word could equally be used for the sort of chap who has his head shaved in order to look tough, or the householder I once met who had an empty burglar alarm thingummyjig on the front of his house, or to a scarecrow.And if you spend enough money at a tattoo parlour, you too, dear reader, can even have a pseudaposematic arse.The female polyphemus moth looking morose*Although I learnt today that if you're slithering around in the undergrowth with a camera and a passer-by asks you what you're doing, don't reply \"I'm trying to look at a duck's bottom.\"P.S. It can also be called Batesian mimicry.A political journalist just asked me whether I had seen her flip-flops and for a second I thought it was a reference to a change of policy: the dithering of a politician or the tergiversation of an editorial line. It turned out she was talking about shoes.I don't like the term flip-flop. Even though I can see that it flips the one way and flops the other and that it combines this with ablaut reduplication (like ping pong or tick tock). Perhaps I just don't like the fl sound.Imagine if Tennyson had changed the last lines of Supposed Confessions of a Second-Rate Sensitive Mind from:O spirit and heart made desolate!O damnèd vacillating state!To:O damnèd flip-and-flopping state!He would never have been ennobled.Far better is the word girouettism, which means \"the practice of frequently altering one’s opinions or principles to follow popular trends\". It comes from the French for weather vane because of course a weather vane turns whichever way the wind blows. Girouettism also allows you to accuse your opponent of being a girouettist, which would cow anybody or at least send them scuttling to a dictionary.In Quebec the word is considered so rude that it banned in parliament.P.S.

{"title": "Incommunicable Earliness", "date": "Sunday 25 April 2010", "text": "There's a point in The Third Policeman where the narrator is describing walking out onto a country road. He says:There was an incommunicable earliness about everything.It is a strange phrase, but I know exactly what he means. The morning is not like the evening. Though sometimes it is clear and sharp and at other times masks itself in mists, the morning feels like the morning and I don't why. The point is, that I can imagine myself trying to describe exactly this sensation, the sensation that it is morning, using all sorts of silly words. I might point out that it was cold. I might mention dew. I might mention birdsong or make some fatuous observation about flowers that have closed up for the night (I know nothing about flowers beyond Ophelia's last scene, Lycidas and Ode to a Nightingale), and all to try to describe to the reader that incommunicable earliness of everything.But then Flann O'Brien comes along and draws away the veil, slices through the budding verbal vegetation and simply says \"There was an incommunicable earliness about everything.I believe, too, that this was how Flann O'Brien must have approached the problem. It is (for various reasons) terribly important in the novel that no time has passed and it is still early morning (they have been outside time), but it is also important that nobody should have a watch by which to measure things. Even the sun must be avoided, as certainties are anathema to the whole theme of The Third Policeman. So I imagine him jotting down a few pointers - dew, flowers, mists - and becoming frustrated. Then he gives up. He decides to write instead of \"the incommunicable earliness\" and he uses that word - incommunicable - precisely because he feels defeated.Yet it works. I know precisely what he means. He has cut away the inventive aspect of writing and instead is telling, and telling works perfectly.

{"title": "Thou and You", "date": "Friday 23 April 2010", "text": "Here's some lovely poetry courtesy of Andrew Marvell. Notice the words in bold.Had we but world enough, and time,This coyness, Lady, were no crimeWe would sit down and think which wayTo walk and pass our long love's day.Thou by the Indian Ganges' sideShouldst rubies find: I by the tideOf Humber would complain. I wouldLove you ten years before the Flood,And you should, if you please, refuseTill the conversion of the Jews.My vegetable love should growVaster than empires, and more slow;An hundred years should go to praiseThine eyes and on thy forehead gaze;Two hundred to adore each breast,But thirty thousand to the rest;An age at least to every part,And the last age should show your heart.Once upon a time English was nice and simple. There was the second person singular thou and the second person plural you. Then in 1066 everything went wrong. The Normans arrived bringing with them the royal plural. \"We are not amused,\" said Queen Victoria. \"We are Henry the Eighth, we are,\" said Henry the Eighth. This pluralisation of royals was not simply I becoming we, they also had to be addressed as though they were plural. So the top of society started to demand that they were addressed plurally as you.   This spread. You became a simple reverential form. Through the sixteenth century it got more and more complicated. People would call others you in the way that junk mail tends to add an esquire to my name. You was everywhere. Thou was familar or condescending. You used it to your servants.  So what do you call the girl you love? What do you say when you are trying to be familiar with the queen of your heart. Do you wish for worship or intimacy? Can you be intimate with your deity? Does it depend whether, like Marvell, you're in Hull or London?  None of these questions bothered William Tyndale as he sat down in the early sixteenth century to translate the Bible. Not for him the shallow flirtations and flattery of society, nor the intricacies of adoration: he wanted accuracy. Now, Greek (in which the Gospels are written) has a second person singular and a second person plural. So he translated the singular as thou and the plural as you. That is why God is thou: not because He is your friend (He isn't, He thinks you're bad), but because God is singular. Jesus thous (it can be a verb like tutoyer) individuals and yous crowds. And here is an oddity, here is a bit of the screenplay for scene 57 of that delicate, lyrical work The Return of the Jedi:Darth Vader, standing with other members of the Imperial council, cautiously approaches his master. The ruler's back is to Vader. After several tense moments, the Emperor's chair rotates around to face him.VADER What is thy bidding, my Master?Thou was the singular, then it was the familiar, then it was the condescending, then it was left only in the Bible often used to address God, and thus thou became reverential again. Well I say that thou has survived only in the Bible. I believe that there are still a couple of people in Yorkshire who thou each other (I'll believe anything about Yorkshire). A popular beat combo from Leeds called (slightly tautologically) the Kaiser Chiefs recorded a song alarmingly titled I Predict A Riot with the lines:Watching the people get lairyIt's not very pretty I tell theeWalking through town is quite scaryIt's not very sensible eitherWhich is thou's proof of life, or at least life Yorkshire.To return for a second to Andrew Marvell, he was MP for Hull (hence the reference to the \"Tide of Humber\") and wrote beautiful poetry. William Wilberforce was also MP for Hull and was instrumental in stopping the slave trade. So who, dear reader, who could fill this great post now?

{"title": "Immemorial Time", "date": "Thursday 22 April 2010", "text": "Immemorial is such a beautiful word that it seems a screaming shame that it should be stuck in a barren marriage with time. It is worse that it is forced to be post-positive, sitting miserably behind its noun. People don't notice post-positive adjectives. Martial courts, laureate poets and apparent heirs all have a slight surprise as the reader notices the adjective for the first time and exclaims \"Ah! A warlike court!\"Immemorial, unremembered, time out of mind. As proof of how we forget a post-positive adjective's meaning, here is a chap interviewed in The Guardian about a cricketer's marriage:India and Pakistan, for time immemorial, have been portrayed as two warring nations which has had a humongous* impact on our psyche. Now as Pakistan only became a state in 1947, that implies either a strange amnesia on the part of our pensioners, or that immemorial has slunk out of significance.The reason for this barren yoking is that time immemorial has, or had, a precise meaning in English law. It was the time before the 6th of July 1189 and was set as such in 1276, meaning that human memory must last for 87 years, which seems about right to me.Yet can those lovely Ms been left to rot? Shall we let Time, to almost quote Shakespeare, come and take my love away?No. The word, though rusty, is serviceable. It is common, it's meaning is clear, and look at the results.

{"title": "Masochism and Leopold Von Sacher Masoch", "date": "Wednesday 21 April 2010", "text": "Everybody who knows anything at all knows that the word sadism was given to us by the Marquis de Sade; yet Leopold Von Sacher Masoch who gave us the word masochism is known to few, or less. This seems rather appropriate. Whilst the Marquis strides around spanking Fame's bottom with a hardbacked copy of The Hundred and Twenty Days of Sodom; little Leo is forgotten in some ratty cellar, wearing a gimp-suit and whimpering over a copy of Venus in Furs.Venus in Furs was Masoch's great work. It describes a chap called Severin who signs a contract with a lady (I use the term loosely) who is thereby:...entitled not only to punish her slave as she deems best, even for the slightest inadvertence or fault, but also is herewith given the right to torture him as the mood may seize her or merely for the sake of whiling away the time...I have never read the novel, but imagine that it would make a splendid book-group read, or christening present. Even that masterwork is better known these days as a song by the Velvet Underground, whose lyrics have a fragile connection to the original, mainly in the use of the name Severin.Venus in Furs was rather closely based upon Leo's own life. He met a girl with the ridiculous name of Fanny Pistor. They signed just such a contract and they set off to Florence together with him pretending to be her servant. The novel thus fictionalised and already fictional existence.Anyway, when, in 1883, Richard Von Krafft-Ebing was casting around for a name for a newly classified perversion he decided on Leopold Von Sacher Masoch. He wrote in Psychopathia Sexualis that: I feel justified in calling this sexual anomaly \"Masochism,\" because the author Sacher-Masoch frequently made this perversion, which up to his time was quite unknown to the scientific world as such, the substratum of his writings... he was a gifted writer, and as such would have achieved real greatness had he been actuated by normally sexual feelings.Psychopathia Sexualis also gave us the words sadism (although he says that this word had been around in France, obviously) and homosexual.Poor Leo was still alive when his name was appropriated and was, apparently, a trifle peeved by the terminology. Mind you, he probably rather enjoyed the humiliation.Leo and Fanny (note the whip)P.S. This post was originally going to be part of Old Nick the Quisling, from last month."},

{"title": "The Wright Brothers, Baedeker and the Beauty of Pylons", "date": "Monday 19 April 2010", "text": "What, dear reader, do these two photographs have in common?Give up? So soon? Ah well, dear reader, you were never one to make an effort, were you? They are both pictures of pylons, for strange and gradual reasons that I shall explain as gently as possible.Once upon a time there was a Greek word pylon that meant gate. It was a dull Greek word that might have died in obscurity were it not for the fine classical education of Egyptologists. They took pylon and decided to use it for the gateways of Egyptian temples. They had already decided to call the entrance to Greek temples the propylaeum.Egyptian temples tend to have the same kinds of gateways. You have two big towers on either side and then a cross-beam between them, as in the illustration that I have so solicitously provided. Things might have stopped there were it not for bridges. In the late nineteenth century people liked to put towers at either end of a bridge: not for any practical purpose, you understand, just because they looked nice. Such pylons can be found on the Pont Alexandre III in Paris. You see the towers at either end? You see how they could be considered like the towers of the Egyptian temples with a crossbeam between? It's tenuous. Almost the first reference that I can find to pylons in this sense comes from the 1901 Baedeker guide to Paris, which describes these very pylons and the statues that perched atop them. The same volume of Baedeker also refers to the obelisk in Paris, and to how it had been taken from the temple of Ramses II at Thebes where it had stood \"in front of a 'pylon', or gateway\".From here, things become a trifle muddied. It is certain that in suspension bridges, which had been around for a century, these pylons were used to hold the cables that held the bridge. However, the OED is extraordinarily unhelpful on this front. I found an architectural dictionary of 1912 that said they were purely decorative. Nonetheless, observe the wonders of Bristol.A pylon if ever I saw oneWhat is certain is that seven years after that Baedeker was written, on the far side of the Atlantic, in North Carolina (near Buncombe country about which I have blogged), the Wright brothers were trying to make their new-fangled airplanes take off. This was troublesome as planes have to gather speed terribly quickly. So they came up with a cunning plan. They built a metal frame tower. At the top of it they had a heavy weight attached by rope to a pulley and thence to the land-loving aircraft. When they dropped the weight the aircraft would be yanked forward giving it the speed required for take off. Here is a picture:The tower was rather useful. It was light and easy to build and terribly importantly it marked where the runway was. Early aviators found this aspect so useful that they would have a line of pylons marking the approach to the runway. Then they got used as markers in airplane races. You would take off, head for a pylon, perform a pylon turn around it and return to the runway. I can't work out whether the Wright Brothers were the first to call this a pylon, but it was in use by 1909 and here's a lovely illustration from a 1912 edition of Popular Mechanics:So now you have lines of frame towers running across the countryside. And from there, dear reader, you get the modern sense, which pops up in 1923 in a novel by Edward Shanks, and by 1930 we finally arrive at the poetry:Power-stations locked, deserted, since they drew the boiler firesPylons falling or subsiding, trailing dead high-tension wires;*So wrote W.H. Auden and three years later Stephen Spender wrote a whole poem called simply \"The Pylons\". So fond were these thirties poets of Egyptian gateways that they were later known as the Pylon School of poetry.   Betjeman, who was not of the Pylon School, reacted thus:   Encase your legs in nylons Bestride your hills with pylons O age without a soul   For myself, I have always been rather fond of pylons. The discipline of structural necessity gives them elegance. They seem like great elegant giants striding single-file across the countryside. If Don Quixote were alive today, I am certain that he would charge them and not windmills.   It is a frailty of the aesthetic sense that people rarely appreciate beauty when it is necessary. The Roman aqueducts that tourists now gawp at would have been eyesores in their time. A hideous necessity cutting across the pastoral valleys. Windmills were once no more picturesque than windfarms, because they were necessary structures.   I was once being talked at by a terrible bore who was explaining how he had done up his horrid little house in the countryside. He had preserved at great expense some old contraption for grinding corn. I was not interested. I was gazing at the line of pylons that waddled magnificently from one horizon to the other.

{"title": "Richard of York Gave Battle in Vain", "date": "Thursday 15 April 2010", "text": "Richard Of York Gave Battle In Vain was the mnemonic that I was taught as a child in order to remember the colours of the rainbow. Why anybody thought that I needed to remember the colours of the rainbow, I don't know. Nobody, in all my long and weary years, has ever asked me \"Hey, Dogberry, what are the colours of the rainbow in the correct order?\" But such was I taught, and as an aftershock to yesterday's post on synaesthesia here is a post on the colours of the rainbow.Red: Red letter days are so called because in old church calenders feast days were written in red ink. In American banking ledgers of the early twentieth century debts were written in red ink and credits in black. An Italian debtor is said to be in the green. Either way one is in the soup.Orange: Oranges were originally a fruit and didn't become a colour until 1542. For this reason in the Nun's Priest's Tale Chauntecleer the Cockerel describes his nightmare about a fox thus:Me mette [dreamed] how that I romed up and dounWithinne our yeerd, wheer as I saugh a beestWas lyk an hound, and wolde han maad areestUpon my body, and wolde han had me deed.His colour was bitwixe yelow and reedAnd tipped was his tayl and both his eerisHe then goes on to defy laxatives.Yellow: Has always stood for cowardice, it was believed that a lack of blood made the liver yellow. It's odd that nobody seems to like to mention this colour. I can think of no yellow political party and even yellow hair is called blond/blonde (the only adjective in English that agrees with its noun) or golden. The yellow jersey of the Tour De France is the one exception that I can think of.As Bob Dylan wrote in Tombstone Blues:Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thiefLooks up at his hero the Commander-in-ChiefSaying, “Tell me great hero, but please make it briefIs there a hole for me to get sick in?”The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a flySaying, “Death to all those who would whimper and cry”And dropping a barbell he points to the skySaying, “The sun’s not yellow it’s chicken”Green: The sixth stanza of Anderw Marvell's The Garden runs thuslyly:Meanwhile the mind, from pleasure less,Withdraws into its happinessThe mind, that ocean where each kind,Does straight its own resemblance find.Yet it creates, transcending these,Far other worlds and other seas;Annihilating all that's madeTo a green thought in a green shade.The second couplet, by the way, is based on the idea of contemporary biology that each land animal had an equivalent in the sea. However, even at the time Thomas Browne (the Inky Fool's favourite essayist) was inclined to disbelief:THAT all Animals of the Land, are in their kind in the Sea, although received as a principle, is a tenent very questionable, and will admit of restraint. For some in the Sea are not to be matcht by any enquiry at Land, and hold those shapes which terrestrious forms approach not; as may be observed in the Moon fish, or Orthragoriscus, the several sorts of Raia's, Torpedo's, Oysters, and many more, and some there are in the Land which were never maintained to be in the Sea, as Panthers, Hyæna's, Camels, Sheep, Molls, and others, which carry no name in Ichthyology,Blue: Blue murder is not a rather saucy form of homicide: it is a translation of the French exclamation mort bleu, which is a corruption of mort dieu, meaning death of God. Blue murders are likely to be carried out by blue-rinse blue stockings.Indigo: is one beyond blue, it is therefore a very sad colour. Blues musicians have nothing on their indigo colleagues:For there's nobody who cares about meI'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can beIs therefore a lyric from Duke Ellington's Mood Indigo*.Violet:\"Roses are redViolets are blue\":That's what the song said,But it cannot be true.\"I have seen roses Damasked red and white\"Shakespeare discloses,And he's always right.And a blind man could seeThat violets are violetLinguistically:Such truths are inviolate.And after that we drift into the invisible parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is mostly white noise.Violet in colour, I think you'll agree.*Duke Ellington wrote neither the melody, the title nor the lyric; but the matter is so vexed that I shan't go into it here."},
{"title": "Synaesthesia", "date": "Wednesday 14 April 2010", "text": "She smelled the way the Taj Mahal looks by moonlight.   - The Little Sister by Raymond ChandlerSynaethesia is either a mental condition whereby colours are perceived as smells, smells as sounds, sounds as tastes etc, or it is a rhetorical device whereby one sense is described in terms of another. If colours are harmonious, or a voice is silky, that is synaesthesia (or some other spelling). It is a common enough device, except that there seem to be rules, or norms governing which senses can be coupled. Sight and sound are interchangeable. Quite aside from John Lennon's request to George Martin that the orchestration of Strawberry Fields should be \"orange\", colours can be loud or discordant while melodies can be bright and rumblings dark. Tone is even an ambiguous word that can be applied to either sense, and I thoroughly recommend Ernest Bloch's Sketches in Sepia. (I omit colours that are purely symbolic: blues music is no more blue than blue movies are).Touch can be applied to sound - a gravelly voice - and to the warm colours of a painting. But rarely is the favour returned, indeed I can't think of a single example. Taste gives you a couple of terms of approbation - delicious and tasty - and of deprecation - bland or disgusting. But again it receives no thanks from its fellow senses.And smell. Smell sits apart on his own, blowing his nose. Odious, before you ask, means hateful and has nothing to do with odour. Rank and pungent have, over the centuries, been sent as emissaries to the other senses, but that is all and it is possible to forget that words were ever native to a nostril. And smells are never described as being like anything else at all.And that is why the Raymond Chandler line is so striking. Though the sense is quite discernible, the expression of it pulls you up short. The phrase is memorable in a way that it would never have been were it \"she sounded the way the Taj Mahal looks by moonlight.\"Synaesthesias of smell are jarring and effective. It is probably an easy shortcut to a memorable line. However, caution, dear reader, should be observed. You may not want your line to be remembered. Many critics have been wrong, some amazingly so, but few will be remembered verbatim as Eduard Hanslick was when he wrote of Tchaikovsky's First Violin Concerto that it showed there could be \"music that stinks to the ear.\"I shall leave you with an extract from A Rebours, in which our hero has constructed an organ that when the stops are touched gives out drinks. The idea was stolen and perhaps improved upon by Boris Vian in the wonderful L'Ecume des Jours.Moreover, each liquor corresponded, according to his thinking, to the sound of some instrument. Dry curacoa, for example, to the clarinet whose tone is sourish and velvety; kummel to the oboe whose sonorous notes snuffle; mint and anisette to the flute, at once sugary and peppery, puling and sweet; while, to complete the orchestra, kirschwasser has the furious ring of the trumpet; gin and whiskey burn the palate with their strident crashings of trombones and cornets; brandy storms with the deafening hubbub of tubas; while the thunder-claps of the cymbals and the furiously beaten drum roll in the mouth by means of the rakis de Chio.The whole can be read here. I may be wrong in all these observations and expect a cataract of counter-examples.That's how she smelledP.S. If you're reading this and you've got my copy of A Rebours, give it back before I track you down and hang you. Mrs Malaprop, same goes for you and my copy Ecume Des Jours, they don't publish that translation anymore.Trucks, as in the big vehicles, have nothing to do with having no truck with. This is a crying shame. The one comes from the Latin trochus meaning iron hoop, the other from the French troquer meaning barter or do business with.

{"title": "Llareggub Yobs", "date": "Monday 12 April 2010", "text": "I was told the other day that a yob was a backwards boy. I didn't believe it. So many etymologies are much too neat and fanciful, especially the ones that involve acronyms and the movement of letters (shit does not mean Store High In Transit). But having pooh-poohed the idea I returned to my burrow and checked a dictionary only to discover that it really is backslang.Backslang was a code used by Victorian costermongers and Edwardian thieves. There appears to have been quite a wide (and potentially limitless) vocabulary. I'm not sure how far you can credit The Box of Delights* (1935) with linguistic accuracy, but in it two would-be kidnappers use the phrase \"Kool slop\" which is explained thuslyly: We would point out that the mystic words uttered by the reprobates are common thieves' slang: 'Kool slop' is what is called back slang: the words Look Police turned backwards. It is a familiar warning in the underworld.This seems credible because the thing about backslang is that you have to be able to spell. To know that yob is boy backwards means that you know that Y can function as a consonant or a vowel - knowledge that would be denied to your typical urchin before the educational reforms of the 1880s. [Londoners: there's a lovely point that when the tube was built it was assumed that most of the passengers would be illiterate so they wouldn't know when the train had arrived at their stop. That's why each station has a different pretty pattern of tiles. It is for the use of the illiterate. The same goes for pub signs, but I'm wandering.]Under Milk Wood by Dylan Thomas is the only good radio-play ever written, and is set in the Welsh town of Llareggub, which is deliciously convincing as all Welsh place names are invented by throwing consonants into a blender, or by very lazy Countdown contestants. However, the reversible nature of Llareggub was considered so obvious by the printers that early editions changed it to Llaregyb, just to be on the safeside. The Reverend Eli Jenkins, inky in his cool front parlour or poem-room, tells only the truth in his Lifework--the Population, Main Industry, Shipping, History, Topography, Flora and Fauna of the town he worships in--the White Book of Llarregub. Which shows that I am not the only inky fellow in the land.   It is the glamour of grammar, let a human into the secrets of the written word and he will start playing with anagrams, acronyms, palindromes and semordnilaps; inventing, rearranging, tangling and encrypting. There is an almost holy feel to it, which is perhaps why so many people spend so much time trying to decode the Bible. Of course, this is hard for English speakers (unless you believe the King James Version to be divinely inspired), but in Hebrew you can have hours of fun counting the alephs and deducing the mind of God. As Coleman says in Antic Hay when asked who the devil he is:'I am that I am,' said Coleman. 'But I have with me [...] a physiologue, a pedagogue and a priapagogue; for I leave out of account mere artists and journalists whose titles do not end with the magic syllable. And finally,' indicating himself, 'plain Dog, which being interpreted kabbalistically backwards, signifies God. 'All at your service.'\"I am that I am\", is another of God's titles and a picture of NATASHA I is used to similar effect in Nick Cave's And the Ass Saw the Angel while Red Rum, who won the Grand National whilst I was being born, had his name rudely hijacked by Stephen King. I have blogged before on the wonderful word mooreeffoc, any schoolchild knows which cheese is made backwards and anybody who will pay a pound for a bottle of Evian water is just that. Yet I'm sure I'm forgetting one of the great examples of what are apparently called semordnilaps (palindromes backwards). And it's not even T.S. Eliot's morbid insistence on his middle initial.T. Eliot, top bard, notes putrid tang emanating, is sad. I'd assign it a name: gnat dirt upset on drab pot-toilet.   - Auden (allegedly)Dylan Thomas' map of Llareggub*No prizes for guessing what book I re-read a couple of weeks ago.P.S. There's a good article on backslang here."},
{"title": "Comprachico", "date": "Sunday 11 April 2010", "text": "According to the Daily Mail (which is always utterly reliable on such matters), immigrant gangs have been mutilating children before sending them to beg on the streets of Britain.I have to say that I was extremely dissappointed by the Mail's reporting. Not because of any content, it was simply that there are so few opportunities to use the word comprachico in the world today that I really think they should have taken this one up.A comprachico (from the Spanish child-buyer) is someone who mutilates children professionally. The idea was popularised by Victor Hugo in The Man Who Laughs. He's quite helpful on the subject, pointing out that \"a dwarf must be started when he is small\", which must, I suppose, be where Werner Herzog got the title for Even Dwarfs Started Small.For any would-be comprachicos out there, the correct method for making a child a dwarf is to feed him a kind of moth called a knot grass. As Lysander says in Midsummer Night's Dream:Get you gone, you dwarf,You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;You bead, you acorn!Alternatively you can use dwarf elder. If you're wondering why anybody would want to turn a child into a dwarf, the answer is that they were apparently very popular as jesters.Anyway, there was a lovely word pining away for lack of use, and the Daily Mail left it there unused. Frankly, it makes me sick.They did, though, manage to refer to it as a \"twisted version of Oliver Twist\", which just about makes up.Don Sebastián de Morra, Philip IV's court jester"},

{"title": "Haywire Straw Polls And The Grass Roots", "date": "Wednesday 7 April 2010", "text": "I find few things more embarrassing than making an unintentional pun. Yesterday, a journalist told me that she had been watching the wires and I said that they must have been going haywire. Then I tried to hang myself. Then I started to wonder what haywire meant.Hay wire is (amazingly) wire that you use to bind a bail of hay. Apparently its not as strong as normal wire and should never be used for repairs to machinery. If it is, then your machine will become a \"haywire outfit\". That may or may not be the reason that things go haywire. There's also the possibility that hay wire, like coat hangers and headphone wires, tangle themselves up horribly and that if something has gone haywire it simply means that it has become inextricably interwoven and loopy like the Gordian Knot (which was an actual knot in a place called Gordium, a problem that Alexander the Great solved at a stroke).Straw polls are similarly enigmatic. Auden once said* of the relationship of a poet's biography to his work that it was simultaneously too obvious to need comment (Catullus loved Lesbia) and too obscurely complex to endure analysis. The same goes for these words of grass. You do not, as Bob Dylan correctly observed, need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows. Shakespeare agrees and adds in The Merchant of Venice that an amateur zephyrologist can manage by:Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,You throw a straw in the air and see which way the wind takes it. Hence a straw vote. Hence a straw poll, which elephantine-memoried readers of this blog will remember is a headcount.OR, it is simply a weak poll, a poll of straw. Straw has always been weak as in straw dogs and straw men and clutching at straws etc etc which is why you only need hay wire to bind it together. Grass roots is the third of these frail etymologies. It popped up at the beginning of the twentieth century. The roots I can understand, but the grass seems unnecessary. Why not dandelion roots, which are considerably stronger? English seems to be a strangely graminivorous language. But perhaps that's a good thing: hay fever used to be called summer catarrh, which is just horrible. Or perhaps it's that grass roots are destroyed by GOATs. Now I'm off to accuse my lawn of informing on me to the police.**The Inky Fool's summer residence*In his preface to Shakespeare's sonnets. I don't have a copy to hand.** A grass hand was a jobbing printer who moved employers, hence the sense of disloyalty, probably.

{"title": "Dissolving Parliament", "date": "Tuesday 6 April 2010", "text": "Parliament has been dissolved. Its dissolution was announced this morning. This is probably a good thing as it was dissolute and the country is not solvent. Parliament can therefore pass no more resolutions to provide solutions to the unsolvable, insoluble probelms of national insolvency.All of which is because solvere meant loosen. For some reason, when people talk of parliament dissolving I think of the Thames flooding, or maybe an acid bath.My favourite line about parliament is in Evelyn Waugh's Vile Bodies and describes the Minister for Transport, Lord Metroland:Besides, all this statesmanship and foreign policy had always bored him. In his years in the Commons he had always liked a good scrap, and often thought wistfully of those orgies of competitive dissimulation in which he had risen to eminence.There's something lovely about \"competitive dissimulation\", and, as the preacher says, there is nothing new under the sun."},
{"title": "The Acronyms and Initialisms Database System", "date": "Monday 5 April 2010", "text": "What the world needs is a new quango (quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation) to deal with acronyms and initialisms. The other day the front page of the BBC news website looked like this (note the bottom left and top right):The other one, in case you were wondering, is Northern Ireland. The problem of ambiguous initialisms has been the central scandal of the news over the last few weeks. Proportional Representation has fought with Public Relations on the front page. The International Panel on Climate Change has been in as much trouble as the Independent Police Complaints Committee ever since PC Delroy Smellie hit a member of the PC brigade at a demo (something that I saw on youtube on my PC).The web has the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which stops two people both registering the same domain name and a similar leap forward in initialisms is long over due. I suggest, indeed I demand, that it should be called the Acronyms and Initialisms Database System.I shall write to my Military Police about it.Incidentally, in a preposterously technical sense an acronym is something that's pronounced as as single word like Scuba (Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus) while an initialism is one where the individual letters are pronounced as in DVD (Digital Versatile Disc).

{"title": "Jesus, Bulgarian Revolutionaries and the Life and Death Nature of Commas", "date": "Sunday 4 April 2010", "text": "Commas can destroy or save cities and raise (or lower) the dead. According to Luke's Gospel, the following bit of banter occurred amongst the crucified 1,977 years ago.And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.ORVerily I say unto thee today, Thou shalt be with me in paradiseThe difference is rather important. You see, there are two basic Christian ways of looking at eternal life. 1) You die and your soul pops up to Heaven 2) You die. You're put in the ground. You lie there until Jesus comes again and then your body is resurrected at the last day.That comma, is the difference. Is Jesus saying today that etc etc, or is Jesus saying that Today etc etc?Unfortunately the Greek of the time didn't have punctuation as we would understand it and so the entire question of the nature of eternal life is lost to us, because of a lack of commas.134 years ago this April, the Bulgarians rose up against Ottoman rule. The rebellion was put down with horrid violence. In Bulgaria's second city of Plovdiv 15,000 civilians were massacred. An order was sent by the Ottoman high command to be even nastier to the citizens of Pazardzhik. The order read \"Burn the town, not spare it\", which would have left 25,000 people dead, or at least homeless. However, a sympathetic clerk who understood the tactical importance of commas changed the command to \"Burn the town not, spare it.\" and thousands of lives were therefore saved from peremptory combustion.All of which goes to show that a well placed comma can kill, save, or explain the mystery of eternal life.Would have been burnedP.S.

Scandals, though, really ought to happen in the church and really ought to be a stumbling block to faith, that's what scandal means, etymologically.Greek skandalon meaning trap became Latin scandalum meaning stumbling block. The idea was that when a Christian priest was caught doing something naughty that was a stumbling block in bringing people to the faith. Oddly, the Koine Greek skandalizein could mean to be offended or to fall away, which is exactly what Jesus predicts the twelve disciples will do over Easter in Mark 14v27. When the Last Supper has been eaten:And Jesus said to them, 'You will all fall away [skandalizein]; for it is written, \"I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.\"So it is meet and right and our bounden duty to be religiously scandalised in this holy season, it is a way of displaying our discipleship.

{"title": "Nolo Episcopari and the Rule of the Bellman", "date": "Friday 2 April 2010", "text": "Going on dates is an awkward thing if you're a man, [don't worry, this blog is not about to turn into a whining, mewling narrative of my wayward lusts] especially when it comes to payment [don't worry, I'm not talking about prostitution]. When the waiter brings the bill to the candlelit table it is a given that the man will try to pay for the whole thing - both burgers - but it is also a given that the woman will make some sort of frail offer to go halves, that's what feminism is. It must have been far easier for Casanova, whose birthday it would have been today.The man now starts insisting that he will pay. And the woman? She will probably feel that she should insist a bit too, if only for show, or perhaps she means it. Perhaps she really wants to pay. Perhaps my target for the evening doesn't want to feel in hock to this strange man with the scrupulously waxed moustache, the riding crop and the plus fours. One is therefore likely to be caught up in a back and forth of \"No really\" \"No I insist\" \"I insist\" \"But I had a pudding\". And you don't know when to stop and say \"All right. We'll go Dutch.\" After the first offer? The second? The seventeenth?You don't know, but I do. For I long ago adopted the Rule of the Bellman. If she offers to pay three times, she's paying. [I should make clear 1) That this only includes direct offers of payment, \"But it's so expensive\" does not count 2) That this is not necessarily good advice. I have seen a fair few young ladies, aghast at my acquiesence, reaching reluctantly for their purses before spitting at me and stalking out.]I call it the Rule of the Bellman because everything I learnt about romance I learnt from The Hunting of the Snark by Lewis Carroll*\"Just the place for a Snark!\" the Bellman cried,As he landed his crew with care;Supporting each man on the top of the tide By a finger entwined in his hair.\"Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:That alone should encourage the crew.Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:What I tell you three times is true.\" Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of mankind, just not in the way Shelley thought. It is because ofr the Bellman's Rule that three offers means a split bill.Great men other than myself have used the Rule of the Bellman. Theodore Roosevelt told Edith Wharton:   'I am glad to welcome to the White House someone to whom I can quote The Hunting of the Snark without being asked what I mean! ... Would you believe it, no one in the administration has ever heard of Alice, much less of the Snark, and the other day, when I said to the Secretary of the Navy: \"Mr Secretary, What I say three times is true\", he did not recognize the allusion, and answered with an aggrieved air: \"Mr President, it would never for a moment have occurred to me to impugn your veracity\"!'   There's also a short story called Chaos, Co-Ordinated published in Astounding Science Fiction (1946) in which the humans manage to feed The Hunting of the Snark into the alien supercomputer as a field report and thus save the earth, largely because the computer now runs on the Rule of the Bellman and wipes its own memory of everything that it has heard only once. But then I discovered that the rule of three was not invented by Lewis Carroll. It is far older and used to be called nolo episcopari: I don't want to be a bishop. The idea was that when somebody was appointed bishop it was a given that they would be too humble to accept the post: that's what Christian humility means. So they would say nolo episcopari meaning \"I don't want to be a bishop\". They were meant to say this twice as a matter of etiquette. On the third request they were meant to surrender and take the mitre. If they did not, if they said nolo episcopari a third time, it was assumed that they were telling the truth and a new candidate was sought. To say something twice may be mere manners, Truth speaks thrice.This custom was recorded by Edward Chamberlayne (not to be confused with Charlemagne (I only mention Charlemagne because today would have been his birthday)).Anyway, that's my rule. The rule of three, because three is beautiful. For example, observe this goal from Euro '96 where three people, including Teddy Sheringham, pass the ball across the face of the goal before making the score three nil (I only mention Teddy Sheringham only because today would have been his birthday).     Incidentally, there's a splendid blog devoted to The Hunting of the Snark which can be found here. At least I think it's splendid (I only mention me because it would have been my birthday today).*It should perhaps be noted that Lewis Carroll never married and was probably a pederast."},

There's an Enid Blyton novel called The Faraway Tree (followed by the sequel The Magic Faraway Tree) that takes place almost entirely inside a tree. Timmy Tiptoes is imprisoned in a tree as you can see from the illustration on the left which terrified me as a child. Owl in the Winnie the Pooh books lives in one.[There was a Canadian soldier who signed up to fight in World War One. To get to the lovely trenches he had to take a train all the way across Canada. The train stopped at a station in Winnipeg where somebody had a bear cub for sale so the soldier bought it and named it Winnie because it was purchased in Winnipeg. The bear travelled all the way to England, by which time it had become a regimental mascot. However it was deemed unsuitable for frontline combat, so it was left at London Zoo where it was a big attraction under the name Winnie the Bear. A.A. Milne took his son to see it, but his son couldn't pronounce bear and called it Winnie the Pooh instead.] There's a bit in Lord Of The Rings where one of them (I think Sam) gets almost eaten by a tree. Possibly related: Ariel in The Tempest was imprisoned inside a pine[Sycorax] did confine thee,By help of her more potent ministersAnd in her most unmitigable rage,Into a cloven pine; within which riftImprison'd thou didst painfully remainA dozen years; within which space she diedAnd left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groansAs fast as mill-wheels strike. A suffering that Prospero threatens to revive:If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oakAnd peg thee in his knotty entrails tillThou hast howl'd away twelve winters.I don't wish to get overly psychoanalytical about this because I'm jung and easily freudened*, but can anybody think of other occassions where people are living or imprisoned inside trees, especially in children's books? It seems to be significant to the infantile mind. Here, for example, is the view from inside the hollow tree I loved to play in as a child.*James Joyce, whose pun that was, was immensely proud that his name was the same as Freud's which, in German, means Joy (ce). That's why Beethoven's Ode To Joy was lots of people singing freude."},

{"title": "Salt", "date": "Monday 29 March 2010", "text": "If a word begins with the letters al, there's a damned fine chance that its origin is ultimately Arabic. Albatross, alchemy, alcohol, alcove, algebra, Algeria, algorithm, alkali and Al Qaeda all start with the Arabic word al meaning the. Even the Koran used to be called the Alcoran in English and almonds acquired their l through a bewildered Spanish belief that the Al must be there somehwere. Similarly words beginning sal are as likely as not connected to salt.For example, lettuce and the like need dressing and that dressing will probably contain oil and salt and so it becomes a salad, or herba salata in the original Latin. Salt is also used in making sauces which derives straight from salsa and those salsa sauces can be put on salami and salamagundi.People need salt. I remember the government running a big public health campaign telling everybody to cut down on their salt intake. As the campaign reached its height with talk of a salt tax and other such insanities I was busily ghost-writing the memoirs of a soldier who had got stuck in the jungle in Vietnam without any salt. If you have no salt at all, you get muscle cramps and then you die in agony. This process is sped up if you sweat, which unfortunately seems to happen rather a lot in the Vietnamese jungle.Anyway, people need salt. Soldiers need salt. Soldiers used to get an allowance to spend on salt called a salarium from which we get the word salary. Pliny the Elder, who was a bit of nutjob, claimed that soldiers were originally paid in salt. Others that they were paid to guard the salt roads or via salarium. Others go even further and say that the word soldier itself derives from sal dare, to give salt. This latter theory is hard to swallow unless taken with a pinch of salt.That is not the reason that soldiers are often the salt of the earth. Indeed Roman soldiers used to kill the salt of the earth who were early Christians, persecuted by salaried soldiers for the sake of righteousness. As Jesus said whilst sermonising upon the mount:Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.It's strange that the phrase originally meant the tiny thing (the early church) that made the world palatable to God, but now means the common majority. The important thing is that government campaigns against salty foods are almost certainly blasphemous; or as St Paul put it: Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.And I think we have demonstrated that it is. The word salaam, though, has nothing to do with salt. It's Arabic."},

A single point in space and time.A friend asked me this in the pub on Friday. During the intense and meticulous planning process that precedes all my excursions into the outside world, I had sent a text saying \"The Flask at nine?\" And he had started to reply \"See you...\" and then tried to think of a single word that would mean there and then.Eventually he gave up and wrote \"there and then\" which I concede is not much of a sacrifice, but the problem bothers me.

{"title": "Old Nick the Quisling", "date": "Friday 26 March 2010", "text": "My lifelong ambition is to have my photograph on the cover of a newspaper with a caption that reads \"THE FACE THAT BROUGHT SHAME ON BRITAIN\". I don't know how I'm going to do it, but everyone's got to have a dream.One up from such ephemeral infamy is to enter the language. Here are some pictures. First, the devil himself:Niccolo Machiavelli wrote The Prince, and gave us the word machiavellian. The thing is that though everybody in 16th Century England knew that The Prince was a Nasty Book, nobody had actually read it. The Prince appeared in Italy in 1532, but there was no English translation until 1640. Free of such hindrances as information, the English could therefore turn poor Niccolo into a diabolically, supernaturally evil figure.In the early 1590s Marlowe decided to open The Jew of Malta with Nicollo addressing the audience thus:Albeit the world think Machevil [note the spelling] is dead,Yet was his soul but flown beyond the Alps,And, now the Guise [who organised the massacre of Paris] is dead, is come from FranceTo view this land and frolic with his friends.To some perhaps my name is odiousBut such as love me guard me from their tonguesCompare that to Sympathy for the Devil.Stuck around in St Petersberg when I saw it was time for a changeKilled the Czar and his ministers. Anastasia screamed in vain.I rode a tank, wore a general's rankWhen the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank.Pleased to meet you. Hope you guess my name.I am not arguing here for a direct Marlovian influence on Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, especially as this song was probably based on Baudelaire and the opening to Bulgakov's Master and Margarita. But the similarities get stranger the more you compare the two. (I only noticed this connection a minute ago and am feeling rather astonished). You can read the full texts: Machevil's speech here and the song's lyrics here.The important thing is not a direct connection, but that the nature of the personified Devil in the English imagination cannot have changed very much in four hundred years. The passages are essentially the same, right down to the need to not to mention names (Vide Voldemort).Machiavelli was already a figure of satanic and supernatural evil and from there it was but a trifling step to full diabolism. And so poor old Nicollo became Old Nick: the Devil.Next up, a traitor. (If you scroll carefully enough you can make this a quiz)Vidkun Quisling was a Norwegian maths prodigy and invented his own religion (another of my plans). He also embarrassed himself rather during the Second World War by trying to get Norway to surrender so that he could be the puppet Minister-President. He succeeded in his plan and ten weeks after his appointment The Times wrote:Major Quisling has added a new word to the English language. To writers, the word Quisling is a gift from the gods. If they had been ordered to invent a new word for traitor... they could hardly have hit upon a more brilliant combination of letters. Aurally it contrives to suggest something at once slippery and tortuous. Visually it has the supreme merit of beginning with a Q, which (with one august exception) has long seemed to the British mind to be a crooked, uncertain and slightly disreputable letter, suggestive of the questionable, the querulous, the quavering of quaking quagmires and quivering quicksands, of quibbles and quarrels, of queasiness, quackery, qualms and quilpPerfect journalism. I was going to add two more names, one of whom was surprising, but that Times quotation has put me to shame. I shall save them for next week."},
{"title": "Wamblecropt", "date": "Thursday 25 March 2010", "text": "Some words are just so damned beautiful that it doesn't matter that they are obsolete, archaic and incomprehensible. You should use them anyway. Such a word is wamblecropt. Say it. Each syllable is intolerably beautiful. Wamblecropt.Wamblecropt first pops up in the Abecedarium Anglico Latinum of 1552, which you have doubtless read. It's a sort of early English to Latin dictionary incorporating lots of useful terms for which people might want a Latin equivalent such as \"Wench always beaten about the shoulders\"*. Across the page from which you find:Wamble cropped StomachichusWamble stomaked to be NauseoWamblyng of stomake, or disposition, or will to vomit. NauseaThat ought to give you some idea, but if you want something more precise (or less latinate) then the OED has wamble as \"a rolling or uneasiness of the stomach\" and wamblecropt as being afflicted with and incapacitated by such wambling. So wamblecropt means queasy, only slightly stronger. The odd thing about the word is that after a little citation from 1616 the wamblecropt goes into hiding and doesn't reappear until 1798 in America where it remained. The Massachusetts Spy has the line \"I feel a good deal womblecropped about dropping her acquaintance\". And that, my dears, is almost the end of wamblecropt. It does pop up here and there but always as a joke, always as an example of dialect word, a mickey take. For example, there was a humorous Canadian writer called Thomas Chandler Haliburton who wrote a (rather good) series of sketches in the persona of Sam Slick who says of marriage that:The difference atween a wife and a sweetheart is near about as great as there is between new and hard cider: a man never tires of puttin' one to his lips, but makes plaguy wry faces at t'other. It makes me so kinder wamblecropt when I think on it, that I'm afeared to venture on matrimony at all.Sam Slick uses the word, but I doubt that Haliburton did. It was fast disappearing down the chute of quaint dialect and all future uses are of the 'By jiminee I'll be wamblecropt,' averred the blacksmith quaintly variety.Wambling, of the uncropt kind, survived far longer on these shores. Indeed wambling was a standard activity of British stomachs right up to the late nineteenth century. Here are my three favourite examples: [My soul] can digest a monster without crudity, a sin as weighty as an elephant, and never wamble for it.   - Middleton A Game At Chess 1624 (because I like the sin as big as an elephant)Vast fires subterranean... work and wamble in the bowels of the earth   - John Goad Astro-Meteorologica 1686 (because it revives the zombie-metaphor \"bowels of the earth\")Yes faith have I [been in love], and have felt your flames and fires, and inclinations and wamblings.  - Betterton Revenge 1680 (because it's beautiful)Incidentally, wamble can by extension mean to roll or stumble around and can be spelled with an O, making womble. Womble cropped*Scapularis, in case you were wondering."},

{"title": "Etched", "date": "Monday 22 March 2010", "text": "This is how you etch.You take a sheet of metal. You cover it in wax. You take a needle and use it to scrape your design into the wax. You may wish you use an echoppé. I don't care. Now - and this is the important part - you dip the whole thing into acid: strong, metal-devouring acid. This acid is called the mordant or etchant. Mordant from the Latin mordere meaning to bite, etchant from the German ätzen, from Old German azzon meaning to bite. This is the point: the biting. The acid bites the metal and dissolves it. Then you remove the wax, put some ink on the metal and use it to make a print.This is not the same as engraving. This is not the same as carving. This is not the same as tattooing. This is using damned acid to burn up metal. Got that?Given this, I shuddered when I discovered that a lady/river called Jordan had had her husband's name \"etched on her wrist\". I hope they meant tattooed. There is, of course, such a thing as metaphorical language, but if you can explicate how David Beckham's face was \"etched in agony\", as The Times reported, you are cleverer than I am. Faces get etched a lot. Yesterday's Observer reported that \"Years of conflict\" had been \"etched on a Congo village chief's face\", which is a crime either against humanity or English usage. Written would have done. Or simply \"Chap in difficult circumstances looks a bit glum\". There was nothing extraordinary about his face. I know because they had a picture of it. I would have said he's looking pretty good for a seventy year old: quite a bit better than Shakespeare looked at that age. The BBC, reporting on \"etched\" paleolithic ostrich eggs, either has no idea what etching is or has placed the discovery of metals and acid 59,000 years earlier than was thought. But give a journalist a verb and they'll probably change it to etch. For example: \"President Obama's landmark healthcare bill narrowly etched itself into the US House of Representatives, etching in the most etching health reform in decades.\"They are engraved. Carved. Scratched. Scraped. They are not bloody etched. If you ain't using acid, you ain't etching.Incidentally, and only because it's a couple of words down in the dictionary, when children are trying to get their parents' attention they're being etepimeletic."},

{"title": "Join The Majority", "date": "Thursday 18 March 2010", "text": "There are innumerable euphemisms for death. Some - pushing up daisies, sleeping with fishes, achieving room temperature - are comical and unused. Others are simply prissy circumlocutions: passed away, in a better place, gathered up to God, gone over etc etc.The essential problem with any euphemism is not the verbiage or circumlocution; it's that they avoid a truth. Even assuming the existence of God and realised eschatology, how do you know that dear old Aunty Ethel is in a better place? She may be in Hell. In fact, I'm certain that she is.The great exception to this rule is a solemn and beautiful phrase that has almost passed out of currency: Joined the majority. It came to English from the Latin of Petronius: Abiit ad plures is found in The Satyricon. Whole ages of death are contained in the phrase.Join the majority avoids die (if that was your aim) whilst meditating on the eternal gluttony of the grave. It takes a miserable fact and clothes it in a greater and more miserable truth.It is true. There is an utterly erroneous notion that the majority of all humans who have ever existed are alive today. In fact, about six percent are. The majority is 94%. Facts and figures can be found by following this link. The score currently stands at 6 billion living: 100 billion dead; or as Dante/Eliot said in the Inferno/Waste Land,So many I had not thought death had undone so many.si lunga tratta    [so long a line]di gente, ch'io non avrei mai creduto    [of people, that I'd never have believed]che morte tanta n'avesse disfatta.     [that death had undone so many]The only euphemism for death I like (if it is a euphemism) is Shakespeare's \"precious friends hid in death's dateless night\". Dateless night is wonderful enough (reminds me of Catullus' nox est perpetua, una dormienda) but the enigmatic idea of their having been hidden is what makes the line. As though death were squirreling people away in the dark. Perhaps it has something to do with Cleopatra's running \"into the secret house of death.\"I once got a Shakespeare concordance and went through every single reference to Death. I discovered that in Shakespeare personified Death is a rotting corpse who tends to eat men and seduce women, which is a trifle freaky.For example:He is too good and fair for Death and me:Whom I myself embrace, to set him free.    - Girl in All's Well That Ends WellO proud Death,What feast is toward in thine eternal cellThat thou so many princes at a shotSo bloodily hast struck.    - Chap in HamletFalstaff says \"swifter than he that gibbets on the brewer's bucket\", which doesn't appear to have anything to do with death at all. In fact it's pretty damned obscure to modern eyes because bucket is being used with the old sense of a cross-beam. Butcher's used to tie animals by their feet to a cross-beam and then kill them. The animals would writhe and kick and that's how we get the phrase kick the bucket. Soldiers wittering on about how when the war's over they'll go back home, buy a little plot of land and raise cattle, is the origin of bought the farm. At last he's out of all this.Anyway, given the 100 billion to six majority talked of earlier, it's worthwhile remembering G.K. Chesterton's line \"Tradition means giving a vote to most obscure of all classes, our ancestors. It is the democracy of the dead.\" So join the unworking majority.   I have rambled too long.

{"title": "Hat-Cheque-Point-Charlie", "date": "Wednesday 17 March 2010", "text": "Almost every word in the English language derives from shah.Once upon time there were shahs. Some shahs were happy shahs. Other shahs were crippled or dead. In Persian that meant that they were Shah mat. Shah went into Arabic as shah (ain’t etymology fascinating?). That went into Vulgar Latin as scaccus. That went into vulgar French (all French is vulgar) as eschec with the plural esches and that went into English as chess. But when the king is crippled, you still say Checkmate.Chess used to be played on a “chessboard”. Chessboards are kind of useful because you can arrange stuff on them. For example, when Henry II wanted to do his accounts he did them on:a quadrangular surface about ten feet in length, five in breadth, placed before those who sit around it in the manner of a table, and all around it it has an edge about the height of one's four fingers, lest any thing placed upon it should fall off. There is placed over the top of the exchequer, moreover, a cloth bought at the Easter term, not an ordinary one but a black one marked with stripes, the stripes being distant from each other the space of a foot or the breadth of a hand. In the spaces moreover are counters placed according to their values  - Dialogus de Scaccario c. 1180It looked just like a chessboard and Henry II spoke French it was called the Escheker and that's why Alistair Darling is currently the Chancellor of the Exchequer (the S changed to X through confusion and foolishness). Back in the twelfth century there was a chap called Elias Ostiarius who worked at the exchequer. He made lots of money there, bought an estate and named it after his job. The house passed down to his descendants and then to the D'Awtrey family (who locked up girls), then to the Crokes, the Wooleys, the Thurbanes, the Russells (bear with me here), the Astleys, the Clutterbucks and the Lees who didn't (thankfully) have any children so they gave it to the nation in 1921 as country house for the use of the Prime Minister. And that's why the Chancellor of the Exchequer often stays at Chequers.But chess doesn't stop there. We are nowhere near the endgame. I shall continue unchecked.You see when you shout \"Check\" the game is stopped. At the very least the other player's moves are limited. From this you got check meaning to attack and the idea of somebody or something being held in check. Check meant to stop, as in checks and balances. Check or cheque began to mean somebody who stopped things going wrong. For example the Clerk of the Cheque mentioned in Pepys' Diaries had to keep a seperate set of accounts for the shipyard. He checked fraud and served a good lunch.I walked and enquired how all matters and businesses go, and by and by to the Clerk of the Cheque’s house, and there eat some of his good Jamaica brawneAnd from that you get the sense of a check as something that stops dishonesty. At a hatcheck you get a check to prove that you're not stealing somebody else's hat. Bank checks (or cheques) were therefore so called because they checked fraud. Dictionaries say this started in 1789 but, browsing idly through my copy of the State Laws of Delaware, I found this statute of 1786:And people don't pass laws against things until they've been around for a while. The check was changed to cheque in Britain because of the exchequer and then in 1927 they started to  bounce, which only goes to show that Delaware's legislators were pissing in the wind.And from there you get check off (1839), check up (1889) and Chekhov (1860-1904). And then the Wright Brothers invented the airplane and people would fly around and navigate by distinctive landmarks called check-points. And then WWII broke out and pilots were trained and then given an examination or checkout. Then shops got checkouts and roadblocks became checkpoints and people went to doctors for checkups and stories checked out of hotels and checked in at checkins wearing a checked shirt and all, dear reader, all because of crippled shahs.(And it's nothing to do with Czechs).The Inky Fool tries to guess his opponent's plan"},

Those of you of a foreign persuasion may not know that William Blake's poem was set to music by Sir Hubert Parry during the First World War to boost morale and stiffen upper lips. In fact, you may not know the poem at all, but I'm sure you've heard of Chariots of Fire.Anyway, the hymn is so famous on these shores that reciting it as a poem has become astonishingly difficult. You start out declaiming like Laurence Olivier, but the rhythms and cadences of the music keep creeping in.For example, lines 2 and 4 should end with an upward inflection because they're questions; but the music makes you want to end them as statements. The \"did\" in the first line should be stressed as it's part of the tetrameter; but in the hymn the first stress falls on \"feet\". Indeed, the first thing to do is say de-DUM de-DUM de-DUM de-DUM a few times as firmly as you can. Then launch in.

Every month has ides but March's may not be the one on which a leader should announce his plans for permanence. It took me right back to what dear old Julius said 2053* years ago today: But I am constant as the northern star,Of whose true-fix'd and resting qualityThere is no fellow in the firmament.The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,They are all fire and every one doth shine,But there's but one in all doth hold his place:So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;Yet in the number I do know but oneThat unassailable holds on his rank,Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,In case that speech makes no sense to you, all the stars appear to revolve around the sky, apart from one star directly to the North and about 52 degrees above the horizon (if you're in Britain) that doesn't move at all. This time lapse photo taken over five hours should illustrate what I mean.So Caesar is saying that he's better than all the other stars because he doesn't change and doesn't move. However, Caesar is wrong dramatically because he's about to get stabbed. And Caesar is wrong astronomically because the Northern Star does change, or more precisely which star we call Northern changes.The earth, you see, wobbles a bit like a spinning top beginning to fall down. Therefore, the northern extreme of the heavens, from our point of view, veers around the sky, performing a little loop every 26,000 years. So Julius Caesar would not have been talking about Polaris, the current North Star, but Beta Ursae Minoris, also known as Kochab.There's something very distressing about discovering that the great symbol of constancy used by everybody from Shakespeare to Joni Mitchell** is, in fact, inconstant.

The Anglo Saxons were very troubled by the huge Roman ruins scattered about their dark and rainy country. They considered them to be the work of giants or enta geweorc. Enta meant giants, so when JRR Tolkein, who was an Anglo Saxon scholar, wanted a name for his giant talking trees in Lord Of The Rings he called them Ents. Here's a bit from The Ruin and a translation:Hryre wong gecronggebrocen to beorgum, þær iu beorn monigglædmod ond goldbeorht gleoma gefrætwed,wlonc ond wingal wighyrstum scan;seah on sinc, on sylfor, on searogimmas,on ead, on æht, on eorcanstan,on þas beorhtan burg bradan rices.Which means:The ruin has fallen to the groundbroken into mounds, where at one time many a warrior,joyous and ornamented with gold-bright splendour,proud and flushed with wine shone in war-trappings;looked at treasure, at silver, at precious stones,at wealth, at prosperity, at jewellery,at this bright castle of a broad kingdom.And you can read the whole thing with a parallel translation here.Daily life in Lyme Regis"},

Indeed, I have identified a psychological condition called Lake District Affected Weather Disorder (LAWD), that allows people to say that it's not raining, it's drizzling; or that it's not drizzling, it's simply mizzling. Mizzle is a fine word, because despite being dialect and obscure it's meaning is obvious to absolutely anybody. It means that it's half way between drizzle and mist, which by coincidence is precisely what it's doing in London now.

{"title": "Parenthetical Codpieces", "date": "Thursday 11 March 2010", "text": "I don't know if you've ever noticed the two pictures of codpieces on your computer keyboard.Once upon a time there were Gauls who spoke Gaulish until Caesar came and cut them all into three parts. One of the Gaulish words that the Gauls used to speak was braca meaning trousers, the Gauls being far more troused than the toga-ed Romans. Anyway, from this came the early French brague meaning trousers, and when they wanted a word for a codpiece they decided to call it a braguette or little trousers, which is not to be confused with baguette meaning stick. In fact a Frenchman might brag that his baguette was too big for his braguette, but then Frenchmen will claim anything. They're braggarts (literally one who shows off his codpiece).Braguettes were important back then, especially as part of a suit of armour. Henry VIII (who was rather concerned about his reproductive abilities) had armour like this:So everyone carried on being happily Medieval and building cathedrals and that sort of thing. And then people started wondering what to call the big structural supports in these big supported structures. There was (I imagine) an emergency meeting of builders and linguists and they decided that these new-fangled architectural supports looked like nothing so much as big stone codpieces. Compare, contrast, and try not to think about the dog.Anyway, in the 1570s they decided to call them braggets. However, a fellow called Captain John Smith sailed to America, shagged a native girl called Pocahontas, came back to England, and wrote a dictionary. (Back then men were men and lexicographers diddled princesses.) More precisely, he wrote a book called A Sea-Man's Grammar and Dictionary. Captain Smith didn't call it a bragget. He called it a bracket, and the name and spelling stuck.\"I'm sorry, Pocahontas, but I've got to go back to England and write a nautical dictionary.\"So now you've got an architectural thing called a bracket. But if you want to be really secure, you should use a double bracket. A double bracket looks like this:So what are you going to call this ] bit of punctuation? That, my child, is correct. You're going to call it a bracket, because it looks like something that looks like a codpiece. My etymological dictionary says that this happened in 1750, but I just found a usage from 1711 in William Whiston's racy classic Primitive Christianity Revived. This earlier citation makes me a clever, clever, clever little boy. Now look at your computer keyboard. Top right. Y U I O P [ ]. Yeah. They're codpieces.And so bracket can be traced back to Asterix.[ ] -> *Codpieces have nothing to do with codI wish they'd had word clouds back when I was at university sniffing dictionaries. For those of you innocent and ignorant of such things, the more times a word appears in the original text the bigger it is in the cloud. Here, for example, is Eliot's Four Quartets.You can make your own at Wordle, although I should warn you that some are decidedly less interesting than others. The full text of Four Quartets can be found here. And a final oddness: there is on British television a programme that I have never watched called Wire In The Blood. I've no idea what it's about, but as the title is a quotation from Four Quartets -Garlic and sapphires in the mudClot the bedded axle-tree.The trilling wire in the bloodSings below inveterate scarsAppeasing long forgotten wars.- I assume that the programme is mostly about TIME.The actual rose garden at Burnt Norton, where you can apparently now get married.Oh, and \"Human kind/Cannot bear very much reality\" is the 32nd most quoted line of poetry."},

Shelley once asked \"If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?\" and the answer to his question is Abso-bloody-lutely. It is permanently and perpetually parky, which is tramps' slang because parks are colder than doorways. This arctic chill means that I am often afflicted, especially in the early mornings, by horripilation. I horripilate.I horripilate horribly.Horripilation is the rising of the hairs on the skin caused by cold, or sometimes fear. It is the bristling that accompanies goosebumps. Horreo in Latin meant to bristle or stand on end. So horripilation is the direct descendant whilst horrible is a changeling child that, like petrified, refers merely to the effects of fear.Incidentally, the creeps, as in \"That picture gives me the creeps\", was first recorded, and perhaps invented by, Dickens, along with mooreeffoc.P.S.

The \"read\" in Eliot and the \"hit\" in The Times could both be past or present. The English verb has three principle parts: I write, I wrote, I have written. Some verbs make do with two: I walk, I walked, I have walked. And some lazy, idle, good-for-nothing verbs make do with one: I hit, I hit, I have hit; burst, burst, burst; read, read, read.There's a particular problem with read as, though the parts are all written identically, the first is pronounced as reed and the others as red. This awkwardness often pops up on the Letters Page:Dear Sir,I read this paper every day.Dear Sir,I read this paper every day until 1947 when your journalism went to the bloody dogs.And the reader has to jump back to the beginning of the sentence and repronounce the word in his head.

{"title": "The Emperor's Crown and Other Enigmatic Perversions", "date": "Tuesday 9 March 2010", "text": "N.B. This post was originally written about a mystery, but the mystery is now solved. See the wonderfully worldly description in the comments section. The problem with the Internet is that there's not nearly enough information on obscure sexual practices. It's really quite maddening. For example, I was re-reading Graham Greene's Travels with My Aunt when I came across this line:There was a brothel in Havana where the Emperor's Crown was admirably performed by three nice girls.Now, I'm proud to say that I have a depraved and horrible mind. I know what felch means, I know what changing at Baker Street is, and I know at least 5,636,336 synonyms for the word perineum. But I have no idea what the Emperor's Crown might be. So I googled it. And what did I find? Nothing nil zero zilch rien.It's actually a rather important point in the novel, now lost to understanding.There are several competing problems with understanding the language of filth. The first is that obscenities are not written down enough, except on the walls of lavatories, which are then demolished or repainted. The second is that those places where they are written down tend to be terribly dubious. There is, for example, a splendid book called Roger's Profanisaurus that lists rude words and their meanings. It is revised each year in time for Christmas and then appears on the tables in Waterstones. Yet ten years of revisions have not got rid of the fact that a chap I know spuriously entered the name of another chap I know with an obscene definition. It's still there. I check every year. The Urban Dictionary, which is in some ways terribly useful, is the same. There's an Auden poem that opens:Doom is dark and deeper than any sea-dingleI happened to mention this aspect of doom to Mrs Malaprop and she didn't know what a sea dingle was. I reached for a dictionary, she for a computer. I found that a dingle was another word for a dell (hence Dingly Dell in Pickwick Papers is a tautology). She found this definition from the Urban Dictionary:A sex act involving two people in which salmon roe is used as lubrication Now, that ain't true. I know that ain't true. That's somebody who's read a little too much Auden (if that's possible) and is having a laugh. The problem is that the two best resources for the investigation of obscene English are tainted, infected. They have informational herpes.And where does that leave the Emperor's Crown? What were the three nice girls doing so admirably? Perhaps Graham Greene was making it up. Almost any words in the right context can sound obscene. Have you ever done a flick Geoffrey? A koala gherkin? A Dutch steamboat?If you have any idea what the Emperor's Crown is, do leave it in the comments. Otherwise the details may be lost to future annotators of this great novel. All that the prudish, priggish web would tell me was that the Emperor's Crown is usually bestowed by the Pope.

{"title": "Apostrophes and 'Bus[es]", "date": "Monday 8 March 2010", "text": "I used to have a teacher who apostrophised everything. That's not to say that he talked to inanimate objects, at least to not to my knowledge. It was not the rhetorical apostrophisation, turning from the audience to address a city or a table or somesuch (London, can you wait?). No, it was turning away part of a word and replacing it with an apostrophe. He wrote a lot of notices that would refer to the 'phone and the 'papers, the punctuation point standing in for the missing tele and news. The habit was at the same time wondrously fastidious and gloriously silly. It would be fun to continue it to its logical conclusion: lunch' as a shortening of luncheon, fo'rt'night as a shortening of fourteen nights and 'bus as shortening for the macaronic voiture omnibus introduced by Monsieur Laffitte to the weary streets of Paris in 1820.Technically, if you did consider 'bus to be an abbreviation, the plural would be bus as well as omnibus is simply the dative plural of the Latin omnus, meaning everybody. It was a car for everybody. So it wouldn't pluralize to bi as it was already plural.Mind you, I used to know a jentacular chap who insisted that porridge was a plural as it was a shortening of porridge oats. So \"How are your porridge?\" \"My porridge are delicious, thank you.\"Speaking of macaronic buses:WHAT is this that roareth thus? Can it be a Motor Bus?

It's even topical for me, and Inky Fool will go to any lengths to maintain the illusion of relevancy. I'm off to a birthday party tonight in a pub in West London. More specifically, it's in an area between Maida Vale and Paddington called Little Venice. This preposterously ambitious name is based on the fact that two canals meet. There is no Rialto, no St Mark's Square and no campanile, but there is a small island with ducks on it.Look!Anyway, calling it Little Venice is a bit ridiculous and there was once a man called Amerigo Vespucci who had a distant cousin who married a preposterously good looking girl called Simonetta who looked like this:I mean, seriously, imagine going to bed with Venus. I know I do. Anyway, Amerigo, rather than trying to seduce his cousin's wife, had a cold shower and sailed off to discover things. He came to a place where there were lots of palafitos, which is to say huts built on stilts in the water. Like this:It was, he thought, just like Venice, only littler. So he decided to call it Little Venice, or in Italian Venezuela.Which means that I am going to a party in Venezuela this evening, and Hugo Chavez rules a small part of West London with an iron fist.Incidentally, in order to name the whole continent in which Venezuela was found, a far simpler course was followed: Amerigo was latinized to Americus. All other continents are feminine and end with an A, so it was called America.

{"title": "Peter, Petrels, Parrots and No Farting", "date": "Friday 5 March 2010", "text": "Once upon a time there was a fisherman called Simon. He fell in with a chap called Jesus who nicknamed him The Rock (presumably in preparation for a career in professional wrestling).And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. So Simon was - quite technically - petrified. Anyway, this Jesus chap, not content with renaming his friend then decided to walk on water and, in contravention of every health and safety rule I can think of, encouraged Peter to do the same. This did not work out well. During the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. \"It's a ghost,\" they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: \"Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.\" \"Lord, if it's you,\" Peter replied, \"tell me to come to you on the water.\" \"Come,\" he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, \"Lord, save me!\" With that story in mind what do you call sea birds that squawk and flutter and gather their plankton prey by dipping their feet in the water like this?You call it a storm peter. And then you muck about with the letters a bit - a cock is a cockerel - until it's called a storm petrel. (Alternatively you can call them Mother Carey's chickens, but only if you're an extremely salty sailor and even then Mother Carey (a sort of sea goddess) comes from Mater Cara and Mater Cara is the Virgin Mary so it all goes back to Jesus).Peter went into French as Pierre. Little Peters are called Pierrots and in Franch sparrows are, for some obscure beret-wearing reason, therefore called perots. For reasons even more obscure but at least blessedly British, we then imported this word as parrot. The word first pops up in the alliterative claptrap that John Skelton called poetry. He wrote an attack on Cardinal Wolsely called Speke, Parrot. Some fragments of the poem survive, which is a pity.Parrot got verbed by Thomas Nashe at the end of the century in the equally pointless but fantastically titled Have With You To Saffron Walden, an inexplicable work of incomprehensible invective.Parrots are very important linguistically because they preserve the words of the dead. There was an explorer at the beginning of the nineteenth century called Alexander Von Humboldt. He was in Venezuela (of which more some other time) and found an old parrot that still repeated words from the language of the Ature tribe. Nobody else did, because the Atures had been wiped out a few years before. I don't know if you have ever, in a rage against mortality, called a dead friend's answerphone, but there is something terrible in a people, a culture, a civilisation surviving only in the uncomprehending imitation of a bird.None of which has anything to do with the Medieval French word péter, meaning to fart.

{"title": "Three Equine Etymologies", "date": "Wednesday 3 March 2010", "text": "A few weeks ago I was playing poker. My opponent raised, I saw, he put his hand down on the table. I put my (better) hand down on the table and announced that I had won hands down. And at that moment a little lightbulb flashed on above my head, although it would only have been visible to a trained cartoonist. Also, the idea I was having was utterly wrong.Winning hands down has nothing to do with poker and everything to do with horses; for though horses have no hands, jockeys do. In the final sprint of a close-run race a jockey forces his horse to run faster and faster by raising his hands and whipping his steed. If, though, there is no final sprint, if one horse is so far ahead that he can win at a canter, then the jockey is able to win hands down.Another etymology I once thought that I knew was that of a dead ringer. There was (really) a craze in eighteenth century England for bells in gravestones. The bell would be attached to a rope the other end of which would be in the coffin beneath. This meant that if you had been buried alive accidentally (or even deliberately) you could simply ring for assistance. From this developed the idea that a dead ringer was someone who so resembled a deceased acquaintance that one would believe that rope and bell had been put to use. This etymology is beautiful and bollocks. The term dead ringer emerged in the United States at the end of the nineteenth century. It's to do with horses. It does, I admit, have an etymological connection to bells. Bell ringers in churches like to ring out a series of patterns each one of which is called a \"change\". Therefore you got the phrase \"ring the changes\" and from that you got the false idea that ringing was to do with changing and from that you got the term ringer for something that had been swapped for something else. You then go down to the bookies, place a bet on a slow horse, sneak into the stable at night and substitute a fast horse as a ringer. Then your collect you winnings and squander it all on etymological dictionaries. Dead just means accurate, as in dead centre.Yet if those two origins seem disappointing, if you think me a joy-killing sport-spoiler for debunking such lovely myths, then I have a wonderful wonderful treat for you. Do you know what a flying fuck is? Have you ever wondered or considered what this rarely donated thing could be? Although I once nearly convinced my brother that this was to do with swifts mating in mid-air, a flying fuck has nothing to do with birds and everything to do with having sex with somebody whilst riding a horse. This may sound difficult and indeed it probably is, although I suspect that the bouncing motion of a horse may help in some ways. The phrase was first recorded in around 1800 as part of a poem by Thomas Rowlandson called New Feats Of Horsemanship:Well mounted on a mettled steedFamed for his strength as well as speedCorinna and her favorite buckAre pleas’d to have a flying fuck. Luckily for us, Thomas Rowlandson was a cartoonist and so this earliest citation comes complete with an illustration.

Mickey Spillane, a pulp writer, put it best: The biggest part of the joke is the punch line, so the biggest part of a book should be the punch line, the ending.

The name derives from an old Spanish coin that was worth half a real. So it's the equivalent of the English phrase tupenny-hapenny.As Spanish money used to be legal tender in the USA, I can tell you that a picayune was equivalent to six and a quarter cents.

The original typeface was developed by a secret team of crack orthographers in 1864 to assert British hegemony and Maintain The Empire).There is something so laughable yet laudable about the phrase \"requests and requires\". It has a tone so deliciously, unprovokedly bellicose. It asks politely - requests - and then, without waiting for acquiesence or rejection, just requires, casts away the sham of good manners and jolly well tells the mischievous Johnny Foreigner to stop mucking about. \"We asked you nicely two words ago, now we're fucking telling you.\" It makes me nostalgic for the days when a thoroughly disproportionate gunboat would follow each and every Briton on his unfortunate but necessary ventures into the bloodiness of foreignland (where foreigners come from).

{"title": "Lionized Lions (and Lionel Singh)", "date": "Tuesday 23 February 2010", "text": "According to The Independent Banksy \"is so lionised by the art world establishment (and now by the movie world too) that his edge risks becoming blunted.\"You might deduce from this, dear reader, that Banksy is suffering from leontiasis ossea - a grotesque medical condition where the bones of the face grow and grow and grow until you start to look like a lion - and indeed if this were the case then it would explain why Banksy never appears in public. But The Independent was, of course, referring to the Tower of London.The lion is half of the Royal coat of arms, which is a little odd as lions are not and never have been native to these shores (although I'm reliably informed that unicorns roam wild in East Anglia). This bothered Henry I who decided to have some imported and kept at the Tower of London in the Royal Menagerie along with a few camels (history does not record how the camels felt about this). In the eighteenth century the lions were made available to the gawping public. You had to either pay thruppence to get in or just bring along a cat or dog to feed to the hungry attractions - a policy that could be usefully adopted by London Zoo. The lions were the tourist draw in London. As with the Eiffel Tower in Paris, The Colosseum in Rome or the NEC in Birmingham, so a trip to London was incomplete without having \"seen the lions\" which became a phrase equivalent to \"seeing the sights\". Lion became a term for anything worth going to stare at. The lions were the celebrities - sought after and gawped upon - and so celebrities began (in 1715) to be called lions. Lion meant celebrity. By 1800 famous writers were being called literary lions and celebrity spotters came to be called lion-hunters*, all because of those lions in the Tower.Being a lion, as any celebrity will tell an interviewer, is a tiresome business. Nobody likes to be gawped at. It's embarrassing. Walter Scott, a literary lion, said of the London celebrity party circuit in 1809:If I encounter men of the world, men of business, odd or striking characters of professional excellence in any department, I am in my element, for they cannot lionize me without my returning the compliment and learning something from them.He invented the word and the word stuck, and that's why Banksy has been lionised. It's all the fault of Henry I and Walter Scott.It only remains for me to tell you that Lionel means little lion and that Singh means lion, so in the unlikely event of somebody being called Lionel Singh I would be ridiculously pleased. Oh, and dandelions are lions' teeth. Oh, and it's a symbol of Saint Jerome.  The paw little thingP.S. There seems to be no consistency in English spelling between lionise and lionize, I have servilely followed the dictionary.  *Hence, since you ask, Mrs Leo Hunter in Pickwick Papers"},

They're rather like vivacious people, who only ever appear in obituaries. There's that strange rule of adjectives that they tend to imply that their nouns usually aren't usually so: vide Graham Greene's The Quiet American. I'm no expert on foreign policy, but wouldn't it be a good idea to invade a country where all the civilians are guilty? Aside from the Swiss Guard the Vatican State is practically undefended and they have no serious air-cover aside from the occasional cardinal's hat. They would look up from their maudlin and guilty musings, see the Predator Drone, and know that God was giving them exactly what their sins deserved.

{"title": "Magazines", "date": "Sunday 21 February 2010", "text": "I turned on the television the other day and in that split second between the sound coming on and the screen warming up I heard a male voice say with the utmost despair \"The magazine! It's empty!\"Now I know a chap who works in the magazine business which probably messed with my mind on the subject, but my immediate understanding of the line was that too many journalists had missed their deadlines and that they weren't going to put the issue to bed (lovely phrase) in time for the printers. The voice sounded approximately as panicked as my acquaintance would be in these circumstances.   Then the screen warmed up and I saw an actor inspecting his gun.So what was the connection? Once upon a time there was an Arabic word khazana meaning to store up. From that they got makhzan meaning storehouse and its plural makhazin. That word sailed northward across the Mediterranean (the middle of the earth) and became the Italian magazzino, which then proceeded by foot to France and magasin, before jumping into the back of a lorry and getting into Britain as magazine, still retaining its original meaning of storehouse, usually military. Then along came Edward Cave.Edward Cave wanted to print something periodically that would contain stuff on any subject that might be of interest to the educated of London, whether it be politics or gardening or the price of corn. He cast around for a name for his new idea and decided to call it the Gentleman's Magazine: or, Trader's monthly intelligencer. So far as anyone can tell (and in the absence of a seance we can only guess at Mr Cave's thought process) he wanted to imply that this the information in his publication would arm the gentleman intellectually, or perhaps he wanted to imply that it was a storehouse of information. Anyway, he dropped the monthly intelligencer bit and by 1759 he was publishing this:Cave's arms depot of information was a great success, not least because he employed a young and penniless chap called Samuel Johnson. But if, dear reader, Cave had decided instead to drop the magazine bit instead, we might all now be buying intelligencers. Thus Cave's caprice altered English. Porn mags might have been called carnal intelligencers and that, I am sure, would make the world a Better Place. And my acquaintance wouldn't be working for part of a gun."},

Punning on somebody's name is a rhetorical trick called adnominatio and has been going on, it would seem, since at least the time of King David in the eleventh century BC. Adnominatio is, literally, to the name, so the figure takes the name literally. There were several incredibly witty uses of adnominatio on the name of America's last president such as the bumper sticker: \"The only bush I trust is my own\". Shakespeare uses adnominatio to utterly bloody hysterical effect in Henry IV part 2:FALSTAFF: Is thy name Mouldy?MOULDY: Yea, an't please you.FALSTAFF: 'Tis the more time thou wert used.SHALLOW: Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith!

Then one day in 1998 he lost his car keys at midnight on Clapham Common and, perfectly innocently, tried to find them behind some bushes in a gay chap's bottom. In the ensuing media hurricane he first insisted that that was a reasonable place to look for car keys and then that he had had \"A moment of madness\". The papers loved it, of course. The Conservative Party loved it because every time they did something embarrassing they could now refer to it as a \"moment of madness\" and deflect everybody's attention back to poor Mr Davies' elusive car keys. Everybody loved it, because referring to anything as a \"moment of madness\" guaranteed a snigger.Now of course the phrase had been around before. Who can forget The Flower Pot Men's 1969 single? You? Damn you to Hell, you unmusical swine.However, a quick check tells me that there has been one \"moment of madness\" in American newspapers in the last month as compared to 119 in Britain. I attribute that discrepancy to Ron Davies. Apparently a \"moment of madness\" is how we won the rugby last weekend: which fits.When Ron Davies resigned many thought it the sad popping of career-balloon that was still only half-inflated: I take the contrary view.

{"title": "Everything is not alright", "date": "Tuesday 16 February 2010", "text": "Am I alone in my aversion to “alright”?A neon sign above the Millbank entrance to Tate Britain is currently assuring us that “everything is going to be alright”. To me, the sentence provokes an instinctive shudder – how can everything be all right, when it is spelled “alright”*? But I worry that this is fast becoming a minority view, an eccentricity - although the Telegraph, Times and Guardian all back me up, at least in their official style guides (the Telegraph's describes \"alright\" as an \"abomination\").   I responded with equanimity to the use of “alright” by East 17, Supergrass and, more recently, Lily Allen – pop stars are allowed some leeway in matters of spelling and grammar. Aaron Britt, in the New York Times, wrote an eloquent and persuasive article not just defending but celebrating the use of “alright” in pop, arguing that it means “something different from the \"satisfactory, average or mediocre\" that all right conveys…what... countless…pop musicians mean is \"sublime, fantastic, second to none.\" Alright is better than just all right; it's the best, the greatest, the tops”.But increasingly, “alright” is being used as a standard spelling, even by those who make no pretence to youth or trendiness. The Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal,  a poster advertising social work. Even the OED admits “alright” into its pages without comment, tracing it back to the nineteenth century (when it first appeared in the Durham University Journal) and describing it as a “frequent spelling of all right”. The only glint of censure comes in one of its citations – from HW Fowler, who in Modern English Usage declared that “there are no such forms as all-right, allright, or alright, though even the last, if seldom allowed by the compositors to appear in print, is often seen…in MS”. I take comfort from this, although I recognise that clinging to the recommendations of a 1926 usage guide is slightly pathetic. Dogberry thinks that there is a distinction between “all right”, as an adjective meaning “satisfactory”, and “alright”, as a phrase used to express agreement or acquiescence, or as a conservational marker to signify a change of topic or the beginning of a talk or discussion. I can see where he’s coming from – for some reason, “Alright class, here’s your assignment” (Wall Street Journal, 5 February 2010) is marginally less jarring than “Well, that’s alright then” (Financial Times, 14 December 2009). The very fact that the word can be found in serious newspapers like the FT and WSJ is a sign that it has successfully insinuated itself into standard English – although, gratifyingly, “all right” is still used ten times more frequently in British newspapers than “alright”.   * Apparently – according to Sandi Toksvig, writing in the Sunday Telegraph’s Seven magazine – the sentence is supposed to make you feel depressed, although not because of its spelling. Rather it is designed to evoke 'the ways in which the opposite is the case' – i.e. remind you of all the reasons why things will not be all right. Or alright.

{"title": "Horrid Cowardly Stupid Ostriches", "date": "Friday 12 February 2010", "text": "There was a letter in yesterday's Times about ostriches. A comment article had accused EU leaders of hiding their heads in the sand like a bunch of ostriches. The letter claims the myth began because sound travels faster through the earth than through air so ostriches cleverly rest their heads against the earth so that they can hear things coming from farther off (see picture). It's the equivalent to a human having his ear to the ground, his finger on the pulse and his nose to the grindstone. There's a startling moment in the Lamentations of Jeremiah where he says:Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness. Just as ostriches are now a byword for foolish cowardice, so they were once a byword for cruelty as they were believed to abandon their young. Either way, there must be something about those birds that we just don't trust.There are lots of lovely bestial myths in the language like suicidal lemmings, disembarking rats (hence traitorous) and pacifist doves (as opposed to hawks). The sea monsters in that Biblical passage are pelicans*, which were believed to bite their own breasts when there was no food and let their young drink their blood. My favourite is that chameleons don't require food at all and survive on air, a belief that crops up in Hamlet:Claudius: How fares our cousin Hamlet?Hamlet: Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.Claudius: I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mineHamlet: No, nor mine now.The Inky Fool commuting to work*As somebody is bound to point out, this seems to be a mistranslation in the King James Version and should really be jackals.

{"title": "Shakespeare In The Wire", "date": "Sunday 7 February 2010", "text": "I was watching an episode of The Wire yesterday. There were an awful lot of muthafuckin niggas scattered about. Indeed the oedipus complex seems to be thriving in inner-city Baltimore. Then somebody sent some cops off on a new assignemnt saying \"Brave new world for y'all\" and I thought \"Shakespeare upon the projects\". Brave New World is, of course, the title of an Aldous Huxley novel, but that title was taken from The Tempest V,i where Miranda, who has been brought up by her father on a desert island, finally meets a bunch of humans and exclaims:O, wonder!How many goodly creatures are there here!How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,That has such people in't!Brave didn't mean courageous, any more than cool means cold these days. It's was just a vague word signifying approbation just as wizard did to schoolboys in the 1950s.Anyway, about a minute later the cops were following the paper trail left by the drug money and someone said \"And here's the rub\" and that made me sit up. The rub is not street-slang for a coked-up ho. The context was:In this country? Somebody's name has got to be on a piece of paper. A cousin, a girlfriend, a grandmother, a lieutenant he can trust. Somebody's name is on a piece of paper. And here's the rub: you follow drugs you get drug addicts and drug dealers. But you start to follow the money and you don't know where the fuck it's gonna take you.Now a rub was, once upon a time, an obstruction in bowls. As the Queen says in Richard II when asked if she'd like a game of bowls:Twill make me think the world is full of rubsAnd that my fortune rubs against the bias.It's was on this basis that Hamlet says in a little-known speech that begins \"To be or not to be\"To die, to sleep;To sleep perchance to dream, ay there's the rub:For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coilMust give us pause.And this particular usage was so influential that \"ay there's the rub\" has it's own entry in the OED. It went from being a quotation (As Steele used it a 1712 Spectator \"her Relations are not Intimates with mine. Ah! there's the Rub\") to just being a phrase and ended up in The Wire on the mean streets of Baltimore. Now it could have been that this was deliberate and an Oxford educated script-writer was playing a little game to amuse himself. But I looked up the original script here and though I found brave new world, the there's the rub scene was actually written as ...a grandmothe,r a lieutenant he can trust, maybe. You get those names you show the connection. And here's the thing. You follow the drugs, you get....So it seems that the actor was expanding on his script and the two Shakespeare references were pure co-incidence. One of the thousand little intrusions that William Shakespeare makes into our everyday speech. I spent the rest of the episode planning this post and hoping that somebody would say the word seamy. Nobody did. But as I can tell you're dying to learn. Seamy comes from shirts looking bad inside out because in Othello:Some such squire it wasThat turned your wit the seamy side withoutAnd made you to suspect me with the Moor.The world's his oyster"},

If we go out and make the case, we should be confident we can succeed.The word progressive is one of my pet hates*. Everybody is progressive, we differ only on definitions of the word. Every so often I hear a politician say that he wants what's best for Britain, but they never follow this up with free whiskey for all or the humane destruction of the Cornish. It's always healthcare or further education and other ideas that wouldn't make my top forty.   Every policy progresses somewhere. Theocracy, communism, genocide and compulsory nudity might all be progress in somebody's estimation, though I support only two of them. Mr Miliband is right, though trite, that the \"tide\" can never \"run out\" on progressive ideas (which I suppose form the beach in which the unpendulous case-makers are fighting). Progress can never stop, but to what strange utopias it may lead, nobody knows.   There are three exceptions to this rule. First, progressive and regressive taxation have both become technical economic terms. The former means taking from the rich and giving to the poor, the latter the reverse. Second, progressive tenses, of which I shall blog some other time.  The third is a progressive disease: the stately progress of dementia, gangrene, cancer and the like.

However, it's terribly peeving to me as I had already written a near identical post. Link to The Times here.Matthew Parris told me last summer that disinterest/uninterest was a lost cause for pedants but that begging the question could be saved. I believe the reverse.Questioning the beggarThis morning I offered to euthanase a sickly and diseased young lady whom I discovered floccillating on my way to breakfast. The brave girl's only objection, uttered in a quavering voice, was that she wasn't sure that euthanase was really a verb.So I fled to a dictionary and found that indeed euthanase is not the right word, nor does it even pop up on google. The Americans say euthanize, but according to the word of The Almighty OED we English make do with euthanatize. However, the only citation is from a Spectator of  1873:I saw a crab euthanatising a sickly fish, doubtless from the highest motivesI also didn't realise that euthanasia meant a peaceful or happy death long before it meant deliberately bringing about such an expiration, an idea that didn't pop up until 1869. Moreover it was originally anglicized to euthanasy. The root, since you ask, is simply eu for good as in eugenics or The Eurhythmics, and thanatos meaning death, as in Aimée Thanatogenos (the heroine of Evelyn Waugh's The Loved One) whose name means death-born beloved — or as in thanatologist which is a euphemism for undertaker — or as in thanatorium which is a place people go to be killed.Darkling I listen; and, for many a timeI have been half in love with easeful Death,Call’d him soft names in many a mused rhyme,To take into the air my quiet breath;Now more than ever seems it rich to die,To cease upon the midnight with no pain,While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroadIn such an ecstasy!Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain—To thy high requiem become a sod."},

Nobody said the words 'warning by hubby'. The actual quotation given in the article is:She said: \"He said to my husband and I that he was very concerned about the safety of the children in her hands.\"Husband.I have lived in Britain almost all my life. I have been all over this grey and unpleasant land. I have been to university and I have been to Asda. I have chatted to aristocrats, tramps, professors, pimps, immigrants, emmigrés, builders, bouncers, farmers, doctors, nurses, criminals and even journalists. I have been to the North and the South. I have dined at the Savoy and got drunk in the nastiest pub in Britain*. I have walked and crawled amongst the lowest of the dead, and I have never once heard anyone use the word hubby. The word hubby is in the OED. They have citations from 1688 and 1887. And it's distantly possible that I have survived all these hubbyless years as a linguistic and statistical oddity. But I contend that this word is concoction and confection from the diseased brain of some paleolinguistic tabloid hack. That's why the word was not in the quotation.She said: \"He said to my husband and I that he was very concerned about the safety of the children in her hands.\"Oh, and it should have been \"my husband and me\".A bear and her hubby*This is a close run thing between Off The Rails on Weston-Super-Mare station and Doyles Tavern opposite the entrance to Pentonville Prison.There was an article by Patrick Wintour in yesterday's Guardian which meandered, as Coleridge put it, with a mazy motion. It started out on Gordon Brown and co-operatives. Then, after a few paragraphs it moved on to the weekend's polls. Then there was a bit about leadership speculation. Then there was a mention of The Mail On Sunday, which claimed at the weekend to have seen a new book by Andrew Rawnsley with all sorts of lurid revelations about the Prime Minister. This is a subject that Patrick Wintour ought to know all about as he and Mr Rawnsley have consumed an awful lot of lunch together. So the most important paragraph of Wintour's article was actually the last.The Mail on Sunday has not seen the book, not due out for some weeks. It may make uncomfortable reading for Brown, but not for reasons given by the Mail.This technique of saving the most important or revelatory part of the article for the last sentence is known amongst the ladies and gentlemen of the press as the depth charge. Whether this is because of the delay before a depth charge's explosion, or because the revelation is deep in the article, I do not know. There's also something rather lovely about the authority of the first sentence setting up the apophatic teasing of the second.Lobby journalists filing an article"},

Last night I was walking a dog (not mine) when I passed a young lady haranguing her beau. She was pointing her finger into his face at close range, as though it were a gun, or perhaps as though she were conducting a tiny orchestra that was hidden in his mouth. This digital aggression was accompanied by vocals that went:'I'm not going to bring up how you were late. Late. By half a [inaudible] hour. Or the time in the bath. I'm not bringing that up. Okay? Because... I don't need to bring all that [inaudible] up because...'But I was wending my way down the road and didn't hear her reason.The practice of bringing up the fact that you're not bringing something up is called paralipsis, and that's what this girl was doing. She was listing her boyfriend/husband's faults whilst pointing out how kind it was of her not to list them. She was having her cake and gobbling it up.There's a bit in Chaucer's Knight's Tale where he spends forty-five lines describing exactly what it is about a funeral that he won't describe. This goes into some detail. He concludes:I wol nat tellen eek how that they goonHoom til Atthenes, whan the pley is doon;But shortly to the point thanne wol I wendeAnd maken of my longe tale an ende.Chaucer's exercise in not-mentioning-what-he's-mentioning can seem even to a Chaucer-lover (like me) a rather pointless and prolix rhetorical exercise. But if you're a nosy, prurient eavesdropper (like me) you realise that that's how people really talk. Paralipsis is an essential part of our language, embalmed in the phrases \"not to mention\" or \"I won't bore you with...\"Now, as somebody is bound to point this out there is a very, very technical distinction between paralipsis and occultatio. Occultatio is the literary, indifferent version of paralipsis where you're not trying to put anyone down, you're just doing it. So Chaucer was using occulatio. However, the two are so closely related that they are oftentimes confused or substitued for each other like the Neville twins.\"Not to mention\" can be used for either paralipsis or occultatio. I won't bore you with examples, but needless to say the girl last night was definitely using paralipsis, not to mention her finger.Eavesdropping made simple"},

Mamihlapinatapai means Two people looking at each other each hoping the other will do what both desire but neither is willing to do, or to be utterly literal about it you could call it ending up mutually at a loss as to what to do about each other.At first glance it may seem surprising that the Yaghans should develop such a complex word when they didn't even think of wearing clothes until Europeans turned up and showed them how. However, these two facets are almost certainly related as the Yaghans used to keep warm by smearing themselves in animal fat and cuddling, which if you think about it is a system that's going to produce an awful lot of mamihlapinatapai.One gets a fair amount of mamihlapinatapai on British public transport.

{"title": "Good Gone Home", "date": "Sunday 24 January 2010", "text": "A year or so ago there was much linguistic excitement that book had become New York slang for cool, because that was the first word that came up in predictive texting (2665). This is, apparently, called a textonym. Some other results that I've noticed is that home is third choice after good and gone meaning that as I cycle through I get the phrase \"Good gone home\".I can tell that the verbal priorities were not decided by an Englishman as I'm always flicking through shot and riot to get pint. When texting people about a male chicken (2625) the result is enough to make the puerile titter, although I gaze solemnly and sadly at my handset. I would love to know how the hierarchy is decided. I've worked out that it definitely does not use the British National Corpus. The BNC (to which there is a permanent link on the right) is a one hundred million word database of current English usage on these unfair islands. Some other people have set up a site called Wordcount, which has arranged every single one of these words in order of their frequency starting with the of and to and ending with workless recrossed conquistador.I checked up shot riot pint on Wordcount and found that the order was shot (ranked 1,257), then pint (6,131) with riot bringing up the rear* (7,259).The same applies to good gone home, which Wordcount orders good (116), home (161) and gone (462). This is odd as I would have imagined that, unlike pint and riot, these words would have the same frequency in Britain and America. I can only guess that the telephone companies did the same thing as Wordcount with every text message ever written.Anal does precede cock on Wordcount and I was astonished to find that the latter (ranked 10,870) is the next-door neighbour of penis (10,871) and, for some reason, hare.

{"title": "In [The] Hospital", "date": "Friday 22 January 2010", "text": "Apparently something political has happened in America which will have some sort of effect on how Americans pay their hospital bills, a subject towards which I am passionately indifferent. The only important aspect of the debate, which nobody else seems to have touched on, is linguistic. There is a tiny difference between the ways that we in Britain and they in America talk. If an Englishman is injured he ends up in hospital, the same goes for Canadians and Australians. If an American is injured he ends up in the hospital. You can confirm this little tic with a few country-specific google searches for the specific phrase \"the hospital\". Here are Britain, USA, Canada, Australia. The USA does have some uses of \"in hospital\" but they're always in the headlines where definite articles can be omitted anyway.This made me think about the other places you can be in without a definite article. As an Englishman I can be (and usually am) in the pub. I am at the shops. I spend an evening in the cinema. The only unarticled places are school and prison, both of which are paid for through taxes.Americans also spend time in school and prison without a the and in America both of those are also provided by the government. The reason that I brought in Canada and Australia earlier on is that there seems to be a direct correlation between government funding and the definite article. This is especially odd as Canadian English is usually dominated by their mutinous neighbours to the South. But all healthcare in Canada is public (except on Indian reservations, which is because of clauses about medicine men in ancient treaties that can now be splendidly profitable).So here's my theory (and it is only a theory): if you usually pick and pay for your hospital (or anything else) you will tend to think of it as a far more specific thing than you would if it were a ubiquitous and remotely funded service. The definite article is part of the market system. As I say, it's only a theory; but it fits facts, especially Canada.

{"title": "Searing Performances", "date": "Thursday 21 January 2010", "text": "There's a letter in today's Times from Steven Berkoff. Apparently he disagrees with an article a couple of days ago attacking Kirk Douglas's performance in Lust for Life. He says:Douglas's interpretation was and still is universally acclaimed as one of his bravest and most searing performances.I have, as the phrase goes, a lot of time for Mr Berkoff. The best theatrical adaptation of a novel I've ever seen was his of The Trial. But that sentence is hideous.First there's the rather silly rhetorical mistake of claiming universal agreement on a subject. This tack simply can't work in an argument. The whole reason for his writing the letter is that the acclamation is neither universal nor, as he would imply, eternal.Then of course there's the slightly silly notion of thespian bravery (a form of self-sacrifice not recognised by soldiers, firemen, tiger-wrestlers etc), but that only makes straight the way of the word searing.There are eight thousand \"searing performances\" on google. But searing is branding, cauterizing, burning or - originally - withering: to quote, as this blog always does, Lycidas: \"Ye myrtles brown with ivy never-sear\". The OED even cites a sense of \"to make callous (a seared conscience)\". I can guess that Steven Berkoff somehow wants to say that the performance was rather good, but I don't understand how. Was the performance tender? Bombastic? Ranting (as the article he alluded to had claimed)? Subtle? Gelatinous? Turquoise? Could you change the part of speech? Could you say \"His performance seared\"? Searing is just a nonsense word like iconic or cowardly. It's a word that looks right in a newspaper but that has no meaning. It is, in short, journalese.And that's what depresses me about the letter. It demonstrates that the draw of journalese is so strong that even a writer of Mr Berkoff's universally acclaimed abilities lets all his verbal dexterity drop just in order to write a letter to the paper.He even used the word lambast.Never lambast a searer"},

At the end of the call I said \"Good bye\" (as it was spoken I didn't even have to think about the one-word-or-two dilemma). She said \"See you later\" and hung up.This valediction made me think that she had misunderstood the arrangement and was coming for a curry tonight. So I sent her an e-mail which ran:You said \"see you later\" did you mean \"tomorrow\"?To which she sent the lapidary and laconic response:Yes. That is later.This threw me into terrible bewilderment as to me later means later today. Of course things can happen \"a few years later\", but I always use that plain, naked, unadorned later to mean \"before bedtime\". Certainly if somebody told me that we were going to the cinema later, that wouldn't mean June. But perhaps it's me that's mad and Mrs Malaprop who controls the heights of normality.I have also never been quite certain whether the phrase \"You'll be late for your own funeral\" contains an intentional pun.   The funeral of the late Sir John MooreThe other day I mentioned that conspirators are, etymologically, those who breathe together, just as inspiring is breathing in, expiring breathing out, perspiring breathing through and so on and so forth with transpire, respire et al.There's something lovely about seeing these families of words all of which have gone their separate ways. There's the Mit-Mission family (Latin: to send): commit, remit, admit, emit, submit, manumit, permit, transmit and the rest all descended from Grandpa Mission. There are the fuses: defuse, infuse, confuse, suffuse and refuse along with strange children like effusive, whose verb-daddy is on his last legs. (For those of you who never had the alloyed pleasure of chanting amo amare amavi amatum till your tongue bled, I should explain that a Latin verb has four principle parts that you need to memorise. The first is the normal verb, the last is called the \"supine stem\". It's approximately the equivalent of write wrote written and is the part you use to make nouns. So mitto mittere misi missum is still the reason that commit becomes commission.)My favourite Latin clan are the wildly varied Duct-Duces (all from duco, duxi, ductus, the Latin for to lead).

Inky Fool as, Auden nearly put it, makes nothing happen. But given that I don't give a damn about Cadbury or Kraft and don't even like chocolate much, I adored the bias worded out in this opening line. I'm not talking about iconic, although the word is delightfully meaningless. Two thousand things have been iconic in British news in the last month, including a lighthouse in Suffolk, Rotherham United's stadium, and Ken Dodd. Journalists are all, I suppose, iconodules.Nor was it the healthy, flat-cap wearing, horny-handed-son-of-toilish manufacturing that Cadbury's do. That would have meant nothing had it not been contrasted with the evil, evil, evil conglomerate.There's something so sinister about the word. Say it aloud. It sounds like a portmanteau of coagulate and clot. Company suggests good company. Corporation implies co-operation, with only a hint of corpse (to which it is related). But conglomerates. Conglomerates buy your soul, melt it down and make it into pigs.Conglomerate, though, is a technical term. In fact it derives from geology where it means one of those rocks that looks like lots of different pebbles have been stuck in cement. Like this:Then in 1967 people started to wonder what to call all these strange companies, the product of interspecies mergers, that operated ferry lines, manufactured teapots and sold inflatable underwear all at once.I assume that it was a geologist who had the bright idea of bringing the word conglomerate out from its rocky obscurity. In this business article of 1968 the writer still felt the need to explain the geological meaning of the term. So that's what a conglomerate is now: it's a company that combines unrelated businesses (including melting down your soul to make pigs).And here's the funny thing: Kraft is not a conglomerate. Like Cadbury, it only makes food.Empress Irene, noted iconodule, would no doubt have defended Cadbury, which will now become a corporate corpse.P.S. There was a period in the 1980s when Kraft was a conglomerate, but all that was spun off years ago."},

The second paragraph went like this:The first shock was the sight of the [government] building itself. Its domes had caved in, each at its own bizarre angle, lending the palace a dishevelled look. Then the mass of people outside the palace shifted into focus, queuing up in neat lines at the presidential gates.Now it's possible that the journalist was very, very, very drunk; otherwise I don't see how the crowds can have \"shifted into focus\". Perhaps he has a serious eye defect, but I'm plumping for the gallon-of-vodka solution.In the nineteenth century, when photography was still in nappies, exposure times were so long that people who were walking would be blurred. They would have ghosts flowing out behind them. It was this that introduced the idea in paintings and drawings that movement could be indicated by lines flying out behind a moving object. Photography changed our visual ideas and that changed representations in other mediums. The viewer looks at a blurred drawing and thinks \"Ah the chap's running. I know that because of the technological failings of photography.\" Think about it: have you ever actually seen a runner with lines coming out of his back?There's a technical term for this: it's skeuomorphic. A skueomorph is a technological limitation that is deliberately imitated even when it's no longer necessary. My digital camera has a little loudspeaker that emits a clicking noise when I take a photograph, just like an old mechanical camera. The Guardian journalist was not, I suspect, actually drunk. The poor chap has just seen so many films that he is no longer capable of describing things as he sees them. He can only describe them as he imagines a camera would show them with all the limitations of focus-depth that you have in films.I saw the same scene on television and the crowd did shift into focus.

It said so on the cover. Both books were of course written in French and A Certain Smile was originally called Un Certain Sourire. Yet that title has been translated while Bonjour Tristesse has not. The reason for this inconsistency is, I'm sure, that Hello, Sadness sounds so irredeemably stupid in English (so does the utterly literal Good-day, Sadness, which if anything adds a feeling of lunatic politeness). Some titles, like A Rebours, are untranslatable. Others like L'Etranger dwindle a little in translation (étranger can mean either outsider, foreigner or stranger, but the English translator can only choose one). But these cases are quite different from those foreign words and phrases that, when translated, lose their exoticism. The ancient authority of Latin, the cerebral chic of French, the compounded intellectualism of German and the romantic intensity of Italian all vanish with translation. It's like Helen of Troy visiting her gynaecologist. There is a terrible sense of: \"Is that all it means?\"This is particularly true of Italian names. Would you go to an opera by Joe Green? Or be seduced by Jacob Newhouse?

Godlings seem to thrive in Northern India, where I suppose the weather suits them or somesuch.

{"title": "Slush Funds and Slush Piles", "date": "Thursday 14 January 2010", "text": "London thaws. Snow becomes slush. I nearly went my length today and as I tottered, windmilling my arms like a mad semaphorist and trying to defy Newton, I suddenly thought: \"Why a slush fund?\" And that question only led to \"Why a slush pile?\" A slush pile, dear reader, is the pile of unasked for manuscripts that accumulates in the corner of a publisher's office until some semi-literate work experience girl is asked to read them and post them back wither they whenced. Was the slush in slush pile purely derogotary, I wondered? Or was there some sense in which frozen writing was slowly thawing?Once upon a time slush was just melting snow - either from some Scandy language or simply onomatopoeic - but then in 1869 the Oracle came along. The Oracle was Mark Twain's nickname for a pompous travelling companion he had on a cruise of the Mediterranean. In Innocents Abroad the Oracle describes poets thuslyly:I never see one of them poets yet that knowed anything. He'll go down now and grind out about four reams of the awfullest slush about that old rock [Gibraltar at sunset] and give it to a consul, or a pilot, or a nigger, or anybody he comes across first which he can impose on. Pity but somebody'd take that poor old lunatic and dig all that poetry rubbage out of him. Why can't a man put his intellect onto things that's some value? Gibbons, and Hippocratus, and Sarcophagus, and all them old ancient philosophers was down on poets We can deduce two things from this: that slush must already have been American slang for drivel, and that poets haven't changed much.We imported this sense of slush quite quickly and by 1896 The Times was saying that the campaign against capital punishment was \"steeped in a sloppy and slushy sentimentalism\". Now there's clearly an alliterative bias in the choice of words here right down to the sl, but some sense is implied, I think, of the inchoate nature of slush: ice, water and dirt all mixed together. Inchoate, slushy sentiment is set against ordered, frozen reason. From this we seem to have got the sense of a slushy novel and from that (I'm theorising, of course) we would get the slush pile. However, on consideration I think it more likely that I've been wasting your time. It could simply be that the snow piled at the side of the road is the last survivor of a thaw and so a slush pile would be the ignored and bothersome stuff that has been put to one side waiting to miserably disappear.As for a slush fund, that's quite different. That's fat. There's a rule of etymology that pretty much all words are somehow maritime in origin. As Churchill almost put it \"Don't talk to me about naval tradition. It's nothing but rum philology and the lash.\" [comma deliberately omitted] Anyway, in the eighteenth century sailors used to keep all the fat that boiled off their meat rations. They called it slush, perhaps because it sloshed around. When the ship got to port they would sell all their slush (don't ask me to whom) and the money would be divided among the ship's officers. Hence slush fund.In case you cared - and I am confident you don't - I recovered my balance and, with cautious steps and slow, through London took my solitary way.Everybody gathered round to hear Nelson inventing a wordP.S. Apparently Churchill did not say \"rum, sodomy and the lash\", although he wished he had, and Bismarck never said \"A language is a dialect with a navy\". Ah well."},
{"title": "Litotes", "date": "Wednesday 13 January 2010", "text": "It's a crying shame that David Miliband didn't become Prime Minister last week. There's an interview with him in today's Times in which he begins by saying:I'm not going to plead not guilty to the charge of thinkingReading it I found myself all nostalgic for John Major, the greatest British practitioner of litotes, which is asserting something by denying its opposite. (There's a persistent myth among the lower orders of society that litotes is simply a posh Greek way of saying understatement. It is not. If you desperately want a posh Greek way of saying understatement you can make do with meiosis or a noose). For those of you too young, too senile or too foreign to remember John Major there is a helpful biography of him called Not Inconsiderable.It's also worth noting that litotes is not necessarily a double negative. Puttenham gives the example \"I know you hate me not\", meaning you love me.I believe that with David Miliband we have a chance to return to the moral certainties and linguistic bewilderment of the Major years. The second line of his interview went like this:I think it's quite important to think. In fact, I think that thinking is...A busy day at the foreign officeI was sending an encouraging text message today. I was going to write \"Hope everything goes well.\" I never abbreviate. I typed hope, then my thumb hovered for a second over the 3def key, but everything is an awfully long word. In texting terms it's positively sequipedalian. Dammit, I thought, and typed all instead.Texting is odd insofar as the slowness of typing provides not merely an incentive for orthographic economy but also the time in which to ponder it. A haiku (I despise haikus) gives the former but not the latter. Also haikus, unlike texts, are rarely written by people with anything to communicate except their own awfulness.An inspirational haiku:If you're too thick forIambic pentametersThen don't write at all.It is a maxim trite but tremendous that technology breeds style. The oral was replaced by the written which was replaced by the printed which was replaced by the telegraphed, which was replaced by the telephoned, which was replaced by the e-mail and the text. The oral needed formulas to help the rhapsode's memory. The written produced the acrostic. The printed produced the cliché: a printers' term for a unchanged and reusable bit of type. Etc etc etc.Once upon a time a frugal use of words was called a \"telegraphic style\" because a telegram's cost would increase for every word after the first ten. We texters share with them the omission of I, the and a and a ruthless attitude towards redundant phrasal verbs like \"phone up\". However, ten words for nothing is positively Edenic to the modern texter. Remember that I was just trying to cut down on letters. For true companionship we must go back to the stonemason. Whilst carefully chiselling out each line of each letter economies of phraseology would be as tempting as siren with a feather bed. I would be preferred to M, and L to Q. A stonemason would have laughed at the my petty pruning of everything to all and pointed out that \"prospers\" would have been one key-stroke the fewer. And from such carvers, or lapidarii as they were called in Latin, we derive the phrase a lapidary style.Unfortunately textual, as an adjective, is spoken for. So I don't know that my digital indolence will ever get the epithet that it deserves and requiresTiring."},
{"title": "Linear Ambiguity", "date": "Tuesday 12 January 2010", "text": "This morning I saw a headline squashed into a side-column:BODY OF JOURNALISTKILLED BY BOMBIS FLOWN HOMEThe problem was that I was reading it line by line (as I had to). So when I had finished line two but not started line three, the thing had a strangely metaphysical feel to it.Years ago I used to proof read (appropriately, no two dictionaries can agree on whether proof read is one word, two words or hyphenated) TV listings: the little programme summaries towards the back of the newspaper. I learned so many wonderful things back then. I learned that outtake is one word, that EastEnders has a capital E in the middle and that people read sentences from the beginning to the end. The reason for that last one was that each episode of a soap opera would have two main plot strands, so the descriptions I proofed would look like this:Ben ends up in bed with Tyra and Wayne loses his jobThe problem with this sentence is that the reader is likely to read it from beginning to end. This means that half way through the sentence the reader has:Ben ends up in bed with Tyra and Wayne\"Wow!\" thinks the reader. \"A threesome!\" But then he finds the orphaned words:loses his jobA verb and object cut loose from their mooring and left to drift incompletely on the seas of grammar. The reader is puzzled for a moment. He feels lost. He feels betrayed. He feels as Helen Keller would if you chucked her out of an airplane. Then, in a flash, he realises his mistake. He puts his finger back at the beginning of the sentence and starts again:Ben ends up in bed with Tyra [pause] and Wayne loses his job.So one of my main jobs was to put a comma before the word and. This was not because there was any grammatical necessity. The conjunction and between two main clauses is usually unpunctuated. It was merely a readerly necessity because readers move from the beginning of the sentence to the end interpreting all the time. In this we are quite different from the Germans and Romans and anyone else with a very inflected language. In Latin you have to read the whole sentence and then make a guess as to its meaning. This is because the word order is so loose that a main verb or restrictive modifier can be skulking at the end of a sentence. What that patient waiting for the full stop does to the whole nature of the German mind I quiver to think and it is, anyway, beyond the mandate of this blog. English is ambiguous and the reader impatient for meaning. Of course this allows for one our simplest forms of humour, the twist at the end of the sentence, as in \"I don't go to church in the nude... much.\" All of this is terribly acute if there's a line or page break to halt the reader, but I suppose that both are pretty perilous anyway. There was a glorious Mail article about how the amputee model Heather Mills married Beatles leg-end Paul McCartneyAnd page breaks allowed my favourite joke in Hancock's Half Hour where a policeman on the witness stand is reading testimony from his notebook. He concludes:I apprehended the suspect and took him into custard.He then licks the tip of his finger, turns the page of his notebook and adds:Ee."},
{"title": "Cover-Slut", "date": "Monday 11 January 2010", "text": "Flicking listlessly through my OED I came across the word cover-slut, which means \"something worn to cover sluttishness, an apron or pinafore\", a verbal corollary to the phrase All fur coat and no knickers. The Universal Dictionary of Science, Art, Literature and Practical Mechanics of 1829 puts it more alliteratively: \"Cover-shame and cover-slut are contrivances to conceal infamy and sluttishness.\"  But judging by the magazine rack at my nearest Tesco Metro (etymologically Tesco mother), I feel the noun could usefully be reassigned.A gallimaufry of cover-slutsP.S. The only actual usage of cover-slut I was able to turn up comes from Hall's Ireland: Mr & Mrs Hall's Tour of 1840 and is too deliciously domineering not to reproduce in full.The Irish cloak forms very graceful drapery; the material falls well and folds well. It is usually large enough to envelop the whole person ; and the hood is frequently drawn forward to shield the face of the wearer from sun, rain, or wind. Yet we would fain see its general use dispensed with. A female in the lower ranks of life cares but little for the other portions of her dress if she has 'a good cloak;' and certainly her ordinary appearance would be more thought of, if the huge 'cover-slut' were not always at hand to hide dilapidations in her other garments. ' Oh, then, I'm not fit to be seen; hadn't I better tidy myself a bit? — but aisy! sure when I throw on my cloak no one will know what I am,' is a too frequent observation; and away they go, shrouded from head to foot in this woollen hide-all. There's a letter in this week's Economist on the meanings of the word we.In English we have three: the regular we meaning you and I, as in \"we had dinner together\"; the royal we meaning I, as in \"we are not amused\"; and the marital we meaning you, as in \"we need to take out the garbage.\"This is all awfully true and reminded me of a theory of mine about The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock and the word you.You has two meanings in normal English. It can mean you, the person I'm talking to, or it can be synonym for one, as in \"I know the route I have to take. You go up here and turn right\", which is the same as \"One goes up here and turns right.\"In love poetry (and songs) you acquires more ambiguity. You can be the poet addressing the reader or the poet addressing the beloved. I just listened to \"You're sixteen, you're beautiful and you're mine\" even though I am none of the above. I understood that Johnny Burnette was singing to somebody else. Whereas when Paul McCartney sings \"She was just seventeen/You know what I mean\", the you is me, the listener.The word you pops up ten times in Prufrock. Two of them are in inverted commas and don't count (\"I am Lazarus, come from the dead, Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all\"). That leave eight. Two of them pretty much force an interpretation.The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,You and I are the same person here, which means that you must be one. And would it have been worth it, after all,After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me, You is part of a list of physically present objects and is clearly another person. That leaves us with eight other yous malingering in the poem. Two of them are in inverted commas and don't count. So that leaves six. How should you/one/I interpret them. That leaves six uses that could be considered ambiguous, but I don't think they are. The reason for this is the title of the poem. I once wrote a poem called Letters to the Sultan. I showed it to a friend who said that he liked it but \"They all seem to be letters, right?\" \"Right,\" I said. He paused and then asked, \"Who are they to?\"Readers tend to discard titles and all the information given in them. Eliot did not have to call The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock a love song. He could have called it a song, or simply Prufrock (in fact he originally titled it Prufrock Among the Women, which suppports the point I'm about to make).So the title of the poem is:The Love Song of J. Alfred PrufrockAnd the first line is:Let us go then, you and I,So the you, is the beloved. Not to interpret it so is, at best, perverse. It is not the reader, it is not one (or there wouldn't be an I attached). Nor is there any suggestion that he is addressing his consciousness. It is pretty much the same as Come live with me and be my love: a love song addressing an imaginary beloved and enjoining her to get a move on. And things become more interesting if you carry this through.The next you is here:Streets that follow like a tedious argumentOf insidious intentTo lead you to an overwhelming question . . .Oh, do not ask, \"What is it?\"Let us go and make our visit. We are only on line ten. There is no suggestion that the you has changed. You, the woman, is being led to the overwhelming question, not Prufrock. Prufrock is just walking. His woman is thinking about profound and overwhelming questions and he wants her to stop so that they can make their visit. Capish?The next you is:   There will be time, there will be time To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;   If we stick with the you as a woman the line makes extra sense. It's about make-up.   There will be time to murder and create, And time for all the works and days of hands That lift and drop a question on your plate;Time for you and time for me,And time yet for a hundred indecisions,And for a hundred visions and revisions,Before the taking of a toast and tea. Again you is getting a question dropped on her plate. It's therefore reasonable to assume that this must be the same you who was being led to the overwhelming question twenty lines before. You is not me. There is time for you and time for me, clearly separated and delineated. And here's the important point: the murder, creation and question that are for you, are contrasted with the time for me (Prufrock) which will be devoted to indecision, toast and tea.Here is the point. Prufock is unhappy, conscious of his own inadequacy etc etc etc (all the usual interpretations of him) because he is going out with such an profound woman. That is the conflict and the constrast of the first half of the poem. The point is the juxtaposition. The man's spiritual and intellectual inferiority among the women. She asks overwhelming questions. He worries about baldness. She wants to murder and create. He wants tea.   There is a simple delineation that every critical essay I've ever read manages to miss. She's profound and he's doesn't want her to be because it makes him feel shallow. He wants them to make their visit and not have some deep discussion on the way (I have been on similar dates).   There's even further evidence that a woman is physically there in lines 55-6:   Is it perfume from a dress That makes me so digress?   So that's the first half of the poem. A carefully constructed juxtaposition of profound woman and man who doesn't dare to think about such things and disturb the universe. Then in line 69 he starts to try and say something. But he then realises that any attempted profundity on his part would not have been worth it after all if it wasn't the same profundity that the woman had meant.   And the beauty is that it is at this point that the yous disappear. She becomes a one, remote and considered. The poem now seems to become a soliloquy. (I imagine the dietary enquiries concerning peaches to be aporias). Until the woman with all her magical, other-worldly thoughts has become transformed into a magical other-worldly woman - a mermaid - and the women will not sing to each other, not to him.   Got that? Now go back and read the poem again. Don't pretend you have something better to do. You don't. Here's the link.   Of course you can go on reading it as an allegory of the Bermaniac relationship between image and consciousness of whatnot, so long as you remember that there's absolutely no reason to do so. Whereas my reading is clear and simple and takes account of the title.   Does Obama dare to eat a peach?"},

Every month brings a full moon (though this month it was blue), every year brings its snow (mais ou sont les neiges d'antan?) and every couple of months brings an attempt by the constipated Labour Party to force out Gordon Brown .One of these seasonal wonders of nature occurred the day before yesterday. It followed its usual pattern. The conspirators (those who breathe together) sent a letter. Then a dribble of non-conspirators appeared on the TV and radio saying that the conspirators should not have sent a letter. One of them called the conspirators \"cowardly\". I heard her say so on the radio. Now I can see thinking that such epistolary betrayal was wrong. But I can't for the life of me see how it could have been cowardly. The same goes for throwing hamsters at walls (a habit that I have almost kicked). This from that deep well of truth The Daily Mirror:A student who killed a hamster by throwing it against a wall was branded \"cowardly\".Harry Clay, 19, hurled the pet in the air, let it drop to the floor then chucked it against a wall before binning it.Jan Edwards, of the RSPCA, called Clay's actions \"disturbing\".She added: \"He ended its life in the most cowardly way by throwing it against a wall, as if it was nothing more than a snowball.\"English is, by most reckonings, the largest language in the world and the words of moral condemnation it contains are pretty much innumerable. Cruel, evil, sadistic, despicable, contemptible, disgusting, unforgivable, shameworthy, mean, unconscionable, immoral, unethical, malicious, malevolent, spiteful, heartless, callous, sick, twisted, ruthless etc etc etc.But unless one hurled the hamster at the wall out of fear (perhaps you were frightened of the wall and wanted it to stay back) I don't see that it can possibly be cowardly. \"Cowardly attacks\" seem ubiquitous because of a foolish desire to drag in an accusation of weakness where one of wrongness would do just as well. Like most misplaced accusations this presents the problem that if Jan Edwards of the RSPCA is upset because of the cowardice of the attack, the implication is that she wouldn't mind if the student had ended the hamsters's life in the most courageous way, perhaps by jumping into the big cat enclosure at London Zoo and shoving it up a tiger's arse. (There may be braver ways of killing a hamster but I can't think of one off hand. Maybe a Deerhunter-style game of Russian roulette).Cowardly means running away. Etymologically it means possessing a tail (and has nothing to do with cower, which comes from kuren meaning to lie in wait). A cowardly attack is pretty much an oxymoron. One could, I confess, use a cowardly method of attack, but utter inaction would still be the more cowardly choice. True cowardice requires flight. Only if one attacked due to a greater fear of something else (if I said I'd attack you if you didn't attack the hamster) could the attack really be cowardly. As for suggesting that Gordon Brown might not be the best prime minister ever: that's not cowardly, it's Just Plain Wrong.A cowardly piece of music"},
{"title": "Albigensian Donkey Sex", "date": "Thursday 7 January 2010", "text": "Dear reader, this post will be obscene. Whatever you do, don't read it.This is currently the most read story on the BBC news websiteWARRANT OUT FOR HORSE SEX ACCUSEDAn arrest warrant has been issued for a Leicester man accused of having sex with a horse and a donkey, after he failed to turn up to court.Joseph Squires, 66, of Overpark Avenue, is charged with buggery of a donkey between February and April 1999 and buggery with a horse in March 2004. The things I love about this article are legion. There's the noun pile up in the headline. There's the ambiguity of whether he had sex with a horse and a donkey after failing to turn up to court. There's the fact that he appears to have buggered the donkey non-stop for two months. There's the mysterious change of preposition from \"buggery of a donkey\" to \"buggery with a horse\". And there's a repressed memory that suddenly burst screaming from the vagina of my unconscious.I was a student again. I was alone in a library and... I don't know how to tell you this, but I was reading the Publications of the Modern Language Association. It's a sad fact but true that one in twenty English Literature students has, at some time or another, been intellectually buggered by the PMLA.The article I was reading was on medieval filth in general and the word bugger in particular. Many people know the origin of the word bugger. Basically, a bunch of Zoroastrians from the Middle East moved to Bulgaria to work in the mines, bringing with them a bunch of dualist thought. Several heresies sprang up in the Balkans so when the dualist Albigensian heresy emerged in the Pyrenees the heretics were referred to as Bulgarians or Bougres in French.The Pope sprang into action. He decided to suppress the heresy by putting it about that they were all a bunch of shirt-lifters. Therefore bougre came to mean homosexual or bugger (which was a noun before it was a verb). When calling them woopsies didn't work, the Pope organised a crusade, which, if it didn't stamp out the heresy entirely, at least confined it to Lawrence Durrell novels.Anyway, the point of this article in the PMLA was that the word then went underground. This is because of confessionals. 14th century confessions were difficult things. There was always the chance that if you told the priest your sins in too much detail or with two much enthusiasm he might get a little excited. He might indeed go off and find a choirboy or donkey of his own and even if he didn't he might commit such an act in his mind's eye, which would be just as bad. The result was that manuals telling priests how to take confession prescribed an intricate sort of dance whereby you could only ask the confessor about lustful crimes such as buggery obliquely. Moreover, the confessional manual itself couldn't mention the thing that it was telling you not to let the confessor mention. The result of this was that thinking, talking, or writing about sins of the flesh disappeared for nearly a century.At the end of the fourteenth century it all started off again. The church had decided that it was rather hard to ban something if you couldn't say that you were banning it and the desire to proscribe outweighed the purity of the priest's mind. So the word bugger came back, but nobody could remember precisely what it meant.Whereas bugger had originally referred to any homosexual relationship it was now vaguely thought to refer to sex with animals or maybe even some exotic sort of heterosexual sex or something. Nobody was quite sure and they were still rather embarrassed about discussing it.If a taboo were really taboo, who would know about it?An undefined word gathers much moss. That century of silence and semantic acretion is, ultimately, the reason that Joseph Squires, 66, was charged with buggery of a donkey. As a modern parallel to the confessional manuals, I knew a lady who used the word bugger all her life as an expletive only a little less mild than blast. When she was eighty somebody told her what it meant and she never used the word again.Incidentally, Lord Arran the Conservative Whip who got the bill to legalise homosexuality through the House of Lords was also responsible for the Badgers Act of 1973. He said that his life's aim was to \"to stop people buggering badgers, and to stop people badgering buggers.\"Lord Arran, your life was in vain.P.S. In case you were wondering, which I'm sure you weren't, I was researching Cleanness and Gawain and the Green Knight, both of which are unmitigated filth.It may simply be me, but in my precaffeinated trance this morning I read that:A third of professors could move abroad because of government plans......and thought for a moment that that two thirds of professors had had their passports confiscated. Could is an awkward word ambiguously spanning possibility and likelihood. One can as easily say \"I could, but I don't want to\" as \"I could do with a drink\". The same goes for consider as in \"The moral philosopher looked at his wife and considered suicide.\" Or indeed thinking about, as in \"The efficiency expert thought about taking the day off.\"An academic and his son trying to emigrate"},

I find myself imagining the cartographic conference where questions were asked such as \"So, Bruce, what shall we call this great sandy desert?\" or \"What about these northern territories, Bruce, they're going to need a name too. Not to mention these snowy mountains.\"This is terribly amusing until you buy a book on the meaning of English place names, which are almost all just as dull. Most places are simply somewhere belonging to someone. Birmingham, for example, is the Beorma ingas ham meaning home of the sons of Beorma. Cambridge is the bridge over the Cam. I once spent a childhood car journey looking up every village we passed and would take a guess that 95% of places are like that.And the same is true of the remote and exotic. If I started this post by laughing at the Australians calling some snowy mountains the Snowy Mountains, guess what Himalayas means? The abode of snow.In fact I'm having trouble thinking of a single interesting place name at the moment. So instead I'll tell you that almost all western place names are written down phonetically in Chinese for obvious reasons. Oxford is the only one (I was once told by a sinologist) with its own pictogram. Just as dawn in Chinese is written as the symbol of the sun over the symbol for a tree, so Oxford is the symbol for a river with the symbol for an ox.Oxford: niu-jin. Ox on the left, ford on the right.Update: This from the sinologist who told me that in the first place, whom I e-mailed for confirmation:Re: Oxford Pictogram It does, but I'm not sure if it is the only one. Cambridge I think half gets one (bridge is translated as the Chinese word for bridge, qiao). Basically, Oxford has been literally translated into the two characters ox (niu) and fording point (jin). 牛津 Most other places including London get translated into characters that sound like the English pronounciation (Lun Dun). If I think of another I'll let you know, otherwise some pedant might read the blog and beat me to it.I doubt that any pedants read this blog (I've always imagined you to be a happy-go-luck, devil-may-care, fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants and generally hyphenated bunch), but if any do then please feel free to add your own."},
{"title": "Mooreeffoc", "date": "Tuesday 5 January 2010", "text": "I was reading about Yemen this morning and I thought of the immensely useful word mooreeffoc. My train of thought went something like this.The Yemeni economy is not superb. The ultimate reason for this (unmentioned in the \"so-called\" newspaper) was a pilgrim. Once upon a time Yemen had a near monopoly on coffee. So valuable was this export that the king or somesuch forbade anyone to take a live plant out of the country. They kept the monopoly until a pilgrim called Baba Budan managed to smuggle some seeds out to India.Now if Yemen still controlled the entire world's coffee production, they wouldn't be so poor and might never have developed such an unhealthy fascination with exploding underpants. But unfortunately for the Yemenis there's now an awful lot of coffee in Brazil.Anyway, that took me on to coffee-related words like Mocha, which is the name of a port in Yemen, and kaffeeklatsch, which is a chat over a cup of coffee.But the greatest, the most exalted, the king of caffeinated words is mooreeffoc. It was invented by Charles Dickens himself, which is a good thing for any word. Here is the word at the moment of its birth in Dickens' autobiography describing a coffee shop in St Martin's Lane:In the door there was an oval glass plate, with COFFEE-ROOM painted on it, addressed towards the street. If I ever find myself in a very different kind of coffee-room now, but where there is such an inscription on glass, and read it backward on the wrong side MOOR-EEFFOC (as I often used to do then, in a dismal reverie,) a shock goes through my blood.A lesser word than mooreeffoc might have died there in that weakened condition like a Spartan baby. But mooreeffoc was taken in by a kindly shepherd called G.K. Chesterton. In his biography of Dickens Chesterton took up mooreeffoc to mean a vivifying defamiliarisation. As he put it:That wild word, \"Moor Eeffoc,\" is the motto of all effective realism; it is the masterpiece of the good realistic principle - the principle that the most fantastic thing of all is often the precise fact. And that elvish kind of realism Dickens adopted everywhere. His world was alive with inanimate object. The date on the door danced over Mr. Grewgious's, the knocker grinned at Mr. Scrooge, the Roman on the ceiling pointed down at Mr. Tukinghorn, the elderly armchair leered at Tom Smart - these are all moor eeffocish things. A man sees them because he does not look at them.J.R.R.Tolkein took up the word (or \"Chestertonian fantasy\" as he called it) in his essay On Fairy Stories, where he defined it as \"the queerness of things that have become trite when they are seen suddenly from a new angle\".The word Mooreeffoc may cause you to realise that England is an utterly alien land, lost either in some remote past age glimpsed by history, or in some strange dim future reached only by a time-machine; to see the amazing oddity and interest of its inhabitants and their customs and feeding-habits.So, dear reader, throw away your exploding underwear. Go out into the world and try to see its strangeness and its beauty. Try to see the world with a sense of mooreeffoc."},

{"title": "Gormless, Feckless, Reckless and Ruthless", "date": "Saturday 2 January 2010", "text": "I could see that, if not actually disgruntled, he was far from being gruntled.   - The Code of the Woosters, P.G. WodehouseThe resurrection of palimpsest words is a simple, practically failsafe, form of humour. There are thousands of them loitering in the language like cripples from an old war: neither kempt, couth nor combobulated. Languages are untidy and untidiable. They may be spick but they are seldom if ever span.So here are four of them: all less-words.Gorm (spelled all sorts of ways) was a Scandinavian word meaning sense or understanding. As Orm the monk put it:& 3unnc birrþ nimenn mikell gom/To þæwenn 3unnkerr chilldre A sentiment with which we can all, I'm sure, agree. Gorm seems to have remained a popular word in the North of England, but was rarely written down as Northeners couldn't write because their fingers were numb from the perpetual cold.However, in the nineteenth century literacy spread beyond the Watford Gap and Emily Bronte wrote a book called Wuthering Heights, in which is the line:Did I ever look so stupid: so gormless as Joseph calls it?Joseph is a servant who speaks with a strong Yorkshire accent and the word gormless is clearly being brought in as an example of one of his dialect terms. I don't know if it is this one novel that was responsible but from the mid-nineteenth century onward gormless seems to have spread and spread whilst its lessless original stayed at home on the moors and slowly pined away and perished.Once upon a time there was the word effect. It was a happy, useful, innocent word until it went to Scotland. The Scots are like northeners except more so. Once north of Hadrian's Best Idea, the word effect was cruelly robbed of its extremities and became feck. Those indolent, vigourless Scotsmen who had no effect on things were therefore feckless. This time it was not Bronte but Thomas Carlyle, a Scot, who brought the word into common usage. He used it to describe his wife and the Irish, of whom the less said the better.It's quite hard to see exactly how Carlyle used the word. This from a letter of 1842:Poor Allan's dust was laid in Kensal Green,—far enough from his native Kirkmahoe. M'Diarmid has a well-meant but very feckless Article upon him this week.The article in question was in the Dumfries Courier and though I have a complete bound set of every Dumfries Courier ever published in my pantry, I can't be bothered to look it up and find out whether the article was effectless or simply lazy. In another Carlyle wrote that the summer had made his wife feckless and he even described how living with her in London had turned the couple into \"a feckless pair of bodies,\" \"a pair of miserable creatures\".  Anyway, Carlyle used feckless but not, that I've ever been able to find, feck and so the one word lived while the other drowned in some lonely loch.Reckless is far simpler and there's more poetry in it, which is the important thing. Reck used to mean care (although it is etymologically far from reckon). As Chaucer put it.I recke nought what wrong that thou me profre,For I can suffre it as a philosóphre.Shakespeare uses the word too, yet it has an archaic feel. In Venus and Adonis he wrote:  I reck not though I end my life to-dayWhat recketh he his rider's angry stir,His flattering 'Holla,' or his 'Stand, I say'?What cares he now for curb or pricking spur?For rich caparisons or trapping gay?He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,For nothing else with his proud sight agrees. Shakespeare uses recketh, but only in apposition to cares. The implication, I suspect, is that the word was already archaic and needed the explanatory synonym. In Hamlet Ophelia chides her brother thus:Do not as some ungracious pastors do,Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven, Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine, Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads And recks not his own rede.   Reck is here not explained (except by context) but coupled with another archaic word in old-fashioned alliteration. Meanwhile, the reckless two lines before stands on its own among its modern peers. Shakespeare used reckless six times, as much as all the other recks, reckeths and reckeds put together. Reck must already have been fading, reckless rushing headlong to the future.   The last word for this post (which could have gone on forever and may already have felt as though it has) is ruthless. It's nice and clear and simple. Ruth meant regret and related to rue as truth relates to true. As Milton put it in Lycidas:   Look homeward, Angel, now, and melt with ruth   I don't know why this blog keeps mentioning Lycidas. Anyone would think I was obsessed, which I'm not. I can go for hours without even reading it. I'm obsessed with Tennyson and whisky, but never seem to mention either.

{"title": "That's All She Wrote", "date": "Friday 1 January 2010", "text": "Today Mrs Malaprop told me, on the subject of business, that she had written to somebody. I thought that this was quaint if not quixotic. I didn't think that business people wrote letters anymore, unless they had some legal significance like a summons or a demand for payment. It turned out that she had meant e-mail, a term that she not only doesn't hyphenate but also, it turns out, refuses to use as a verb.Wrote, to me at least, always means a letter on paper enveloped in an envelope. I wasn't sure whether this misunderstanding was due to my peculiarity or Mrs Malaprop's so this evening I did some extensive research on a representative section of the British public and she agreed with me: writing means letters. Texts are texted, e-mails e-mailed: writing is a paper-and-ink business. (Oddly, one can write a song without jotting down a single word or note).Whilst on the subject of the word wrote, there is an American expression, \"That's all she wrote\", which means nothing to an Englishman. In The River by Bruce Springsteen there's this line:And I got Mary pregnant and, man, that was all she wroteHank Williams recorded a song called Dear John with the refrain:And that's all she wrote, Dear John,I've sent your saddle home.All of this comes from a joke current among American soldiers during the Second World War. GIs used to get dumped a lot by their sweethearts back home. The dumping was usually epistolary and often lapidary. The joke runs that there are three soldiers comparing such letters. The first soldier describes the letter he got which was only a couple of lines long. The second soldier says that his was one line long: \"Dear Jim, It's over\". The third soldier replies that his letter went \"Dear John\" and that's all she wrote.  This joke, though not noticeably amusing, was so popular that \"all she wrote\" became a phrase meaning \"to get bad news from a woman\".   I went for years misunderstanding that Bruce Springsteen song.     Obscure phraseology"},

{"title": "Vocabulary and Shakespeare", "date": "Tuesday 29 December 2009", "text": "For Christmas I was given Think On My Words by David Crystal, which is all about Shakespeare's language. In the first chapter he sets about debunking various bardolatrous myths: the first being that Shakespeare had a larger vocabulary than anyone else in history.Having got through all the questions of method and counting, Shakespeare had a vocabulary of about 20,000 words. Most modern, educated English speakers have a vocabulary of about 50,000. This is largely because the language is bigger now: Shakespeare wouldn't have known the words nationalise, juggernaut or internet. It's all about how Shakespeare employed his language.Anyway, all the discussion of methodology made me ponder a couple of points. The first is that we know a lot of quite ordinary words that we rarely use. I am certain that I have not used the word glide in the last week. I'm not sure, but I may never have written it. This is not simply because I haven't been in a glider much over the festive season. It's quite possible for people to glide in and out of a room, I just don't think that I employ the word that way.Another oddity of language is the precise nouns that we all know but never use. These are, on the whole, invisible to us, but are revealed by foreigners. I used to know a french girl whose English was near perfect. We worked together as copywriters at the BBC, doing exactly the same job. But whereas I was born and brought up in England and have an English degree from Oxford she had arrived a few years before at Cambridge to do a masters in philosophy speaking almost no English. She had learnt some as a child but had given the language up at the first opportunity. This had caused her some problems. On arrival she had got a part-time job in a pub and had started learning English slang. After a week or so the job and the masters had left her so exhausted that her tutor called her in to ask her why she looked so tired. 'I have,' she said in her strong French accent, 'been shagged all week.'Shagged in English can, in context, mean tired, as in \"I'm totally shagged\". More usually it means sex.The point about this girl is that after several years she had learnt and learnt and learnt until she was just as good an English copywriter as me (or as I, but that's another post). She had become not merely competent, but a professional user of English.She was, though, missing a couple of words. Once, we were walking together in the Brecon Beacons and she asked me what these \"walls of twigs\" were called. She meant hedges. Another time she pointed at a banister and asked me what it was called in English.It is possible to live in England speaking English for years and never hear anyone use the word banister, hedge, rafter or ladle despite all natives knowing what these words mean. Many words that a native considers common are, in truth, seldom spoken. I suspect that I have used the term rhadamantine more recently than flagpole, simply because flagpoles are dull and not worth talking about. The stange and crazy alleys of my vocabulary bustle, while the wide central avenues are silent.This makes my Russian aunt, who last week told me that a wood-pigeon had fluffed out its feathers, all the more impressive.The point of all this is that David Crystal's method for measuring modern vocabulary was to ask somebody how many words he understood on a single page of a dictionary and then multiply by the number of pages. This would certainly test how many words I know, but employment is something diffferent. Many words are like Facebook friends: technically there, but I haven't seen them in years.I somehow suspect that if I could only start to use the words flagpole and banister more often I would be as great a poet as Shakespeare.A wall of twigsP.S. As evidence for my theory, I noticed only at the last moment that banister has but one N."},
{"title": "The Oddities of Lycidas", "date": "Monday 28 December 2009", "text": "This post will mean nothing if you haven't read Lycidas. Your life will also mean nothing if you haven't read Lycidas. There is a text here.This post is nothing more than an observation. It would be easy to call it a criticism, but it is impossible to criticise something wonderful. I could no more suggest that Lycidas is not a good poem than I could suggest that a sheep is not ovine or three not triple. Perhaps the following observations can uncover something about the way Milton wrote.Here Milton* suggests how he hopes to be praised after his death:So may some gentle MuseWith lucky words favour my destined urn,And as he passes turn,And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud.If Milton is destined for an urn he is to be cremated. A shroud goes only with burial.What time the grey-fly winds her sultry horn,Battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night,Oft till the star that rose at evening brightToward heaven's descent had sloped his westering wheel.That the grey-fly is female is odd but passable. An uncouth swain would probably have had trouble obtaining a microscope and sexing an insect. However, it perhaps grows to something when the evening star is male (his westering wheel). The evening star is Venus and Venus as any fule kno is a goddess. Milton was not any fule, certainly not on the subject of astronomy and classical mythology. Anyone who has read Paradise Lost knows that he was obsessively accurate on such subjects.Here he contemplates a drowned man:He must not float upon his watery bierUnwept, and welter to the parching windsThe corpse of Lycidas, like Milton's, changes throughout the poem. I can happily see that for poetic reason he may not be floating, now sunk and now on a laureate hearse. I may be missing something about the word parch here, but I don't understand how a drowned man can be at risk of it.On whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looksSwart means swarthy or dark. Some believe that the star was dark because of it's appearance in the Dog Days, during which you might get a tan. But I have never seen any evidence for this beyond Lycidas.In this section Milton considers the drowned man's fate. Follow the grammar and meaning closely.Ay me! whilst thee the shores and sounding seasWash far away, where'er thy bones are hurled;Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides,Where thou perhaps under the whelming tideVisit'st the bottom of the monstrous world;Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied,Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old,Where the great Vision of the guarded mountLooks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold.Look homeward, Angel, now, and melt with ruth:And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth.The first thing you ought to notice is that these are some of the greatest lines ever written. The second is that no sense is made. To what does whilst refer? The whether-whether suggests two possibilities but scattered bones can hardly look homeward. Moreover how can the dolphins be wafting an angel who's Pope-spotting on top of a mount?The still morn walked out with sandals greyStill and walking?The white pink and the pansy freaked with jetWhite pink?I don't know what conclusion to draw from these observations. I'm sure that somebody will object to one or other of them, and perhaps one or all are objectionable. Perhaps I should connect it with another strange aspect of the poem: its obsessive anthropomorphism. Where mythology ends and personification begins is an awkward question. Milton starts by talking to a laurel bush, which could just be a poetic address. Then he talks to the muses: again normal. Then the dawn's eyelids are opening. Then the grey-fly is a female musician. Then river after river is humanised. The Deva spreads her streams. Mincius is confided in and crowned. Camus (the river cam) is wearing a hat.Odd but doable. What's odd is that Camus, a strange allegorical figure, is part of a procession in which he is followed by Saint Peter. Saint Peter appears to have an equal reality to a hat-wearing river. Indeed the second he's gone Milton is back chatting to yet another stream. The still dawn walks out with sandals grey just after the angels have been singing. All of this is without mentioning the huge cast of occassional characters like Hippotades, Old Damoetas, Amaryllis, Noera etc etc. Milton does not carry through. He invents an image, be it a funerary urn or a behatted river and then forgets a few lines later that that was his register, his style, his reality. He cannot rest with or carry through on an image. The suggested reality behind the words is unstable, ephemeral and in some cases barely extant.As I passed the threshold of tediousness long ago, I may as well mention that Milton must have been reading Daphnis and Chloe (I'm not sure that anyone else has noticed this). That work contains, among other things, an Amaryllis in the shade, a complaint to the muses that they let a loved one drown and a loving pair driving the flocks out together every morning.When Mrs Malaprop sat down to her Finals back at Oxford she found this question:\"But now my oat proceeds\" Discuss digestion in Milton.Surprised, she re-read the question and realised that the word was not digestion but digression.  A she, not a he.  *Or the uncouth swain"},

{"title": "And the Iron Entered into Coverdale's Soul", "date": "Wednesday 23 December 2009", "text": "Myles Coverdale is my hero. He is the patron saint of inadequate optimists.Coverdale was an early protestant and like all protestants he believed that the Bible should be translated into the vernacular. Thus the ownership of the Bible would be taken from the priests and prelates of the Roman Church. To do this, you of course needed to go back to the original Hebrew and Greek. So Coverdale set out to make his translation bravely ignoring the fact that he didn't know any Hebrew and was utterly innocent of Greek.Coverdale did know a bit of German and the Germans had already started translating the Bible from its original languages. So armed with a dash of Deutsche and the belief that he was doing God's Work he settled down to translate. The result was a carnival of inaccuracy. The most fabulous of his mistakes is in Psalm 105 and it goes like this:But he had sent a man before them: even Joseph, who was sold to be a bond-servantWhose feet they hurt in the stocks : the iron entered into his soulThe iron entered into his soul and the phrase entered into the language. It is beautiful, and like most beauty it is utterly wrong. It should be his neck was put in irons.How this came about is reasonably explicable. The Hebrew word nefesh means breath. Metonymically it can mean neck, because that's where you do most of your breathing. Metaphorically it can mean soul because your breath is your soul (the same as spirit, which comes from the latin to breathe).Once you've got his soul was put in irons, all you need to do is mistake the subject for the object, which Coverdale could do with ease, and you have The iron entered into his soul.There are too many Coverdale mistakes to list them all. My second favourite, which I came across in church one Sunday, is in Psalm 18:As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me : but the strange children shall dissemble with me. The strange children shall fail : and be afraid out of their prisons. Who are the strange children, and why were they in prison in the first place? To what abominable crimes has infantile strangeness led them? Why will fear release them? What the hell is going on, God?   Coverdale's strange children are the ben necker or foreign-born. Coverdale's prison should be a stronghold or fortress. The literal translation is:   As soon as they hear me, they obey me; foreigners cringe before me. They all lose heart;they come trembling from their strongholds. Which isn't nearly as good. It's just another of those dull, dull, dull gentiles-shall-be-driven-before-me bits of the Old Testament. That is the paradox of the Coverdale psalter. It may be inaccurate, it may not be what God or David or a series of writers over several centuries meant, but it is one of the finest works in the English language.   The Book of Common Prayer, which is used on Sunday evenings in my parish church, still contains the Coverdale Psalter. Shakespeare, I once read*, alludes to the psalms more than any other book. Coverdale, though no linguist, was a poetic genius. Had he let his utter inadequacy deter him from his task, posterity would have been impoverished. Keats was wrong: error is beauty, beauty error.     Well done, my son.  *I can't remember the reference."},
{"title": "Tropical Thomas Browne", "date": "Tuesday 22 December 2009", "text": "It is dark. I sat down with Sir Thomas Browne's Religio Medici and in the preface I found these words:There are many things delivered Rhetorically, many expressions therein meerly Tropical, and as they best illustrate my intention; and therefore also there are many things to be taken in soft and flexible sense, and not to be called unto the rigid test of Reason.Tropical, I confess, threw me. I vaguely imagined that some of the opinions in Religio Medici were fit only for a sunny beach. I pictured Browne dancing in a lei while pronouncing on matters reasonable and religious. Perhaps the intense cold had paralysed my deductive faculties for, falling from this airy reverie to the frosty fields of reason, I realised that Tropical meant relating to rhetorical tropes. The connection is turning. The earth tilts upon its axis. For six months the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun and this I call summer. For the other six months it is the turn of my anitscian to don a shirt of many colours and loll around on the shores of Bouvet Island. The extent of this turn is 23 degrees both ways. Even as I sullenly type the sun (from our point of view) appears to be hovering at noon over those who are 23 degrees South of the Equator. Then it turns back northward. The Greek for turn is tropos hence tropic. So the tropics, cancerous and capricious, are the latitudes at which the sun turns. The Greeks, it would appear, used a direct translation of our expression turn of phrase, they called it a rhetorical trope, because a word was being turned to something other than its normal use. So if you use tropes, your prose is tropical.My prophetic soul tells me there will be more posts on Browne before advent is out. Mrs Malaprop is on holiday.

This word, which must have seemed cheerful, irreverent and rather modern at one point, today feels rather dated – to me, it is somehow redolent of the 1980s, although the OED has a citation for “Dick Crimbo” (meaning St Nicholas) as early as the 1960s. An OED citation for a closely-related word, “crimble”, perfectly captures the period flavour: “Stevie's determined to have a well-wacky Crimble do” (Just 17, 1987). At any rate, both “crimbo” and “crimble” (the jury is out on whether to capitalise them, although Christmas is almost always capitalised, presumably because of the reference to Christ) seem to be fading from popular use. Over the last five years, there has been a steady decline in their use by British journalists, as the chart below demonstrates. The OED is slightly vague on etymology. It describes both words as \"humorous alteration[s] of Christmas, perhaps reflecting childish speech\". The earliest citation for \"crimble\" is in a Beatles Christmas message, cited in the New Musical Express in December 1963: \"Garry Crimble to you, Garry Crimble to you, Garry Bable, Dear Christmas, Happy Birthday, me too!\" The earliest recorded reference to \"crimbo\" is from The Strand Magazine in 1928: \"You've saved your man, by crimbo\". It's not clear that this is actually a reference to Christmas - to me it sounds more like an exclamation along the lines of \"by Jingo!\". That said, \"Christmas\" (in phrases like \"Oh, Christmas\" or \"Jiminy Christmas\") was also used as an interjection in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries - perhaps, like \"cripes\" or \"crikey\", a euphemism for \"Christ\" - so \"crimbo\" could be a variation on that.\"Yule\" is much easier. It's straight from the Vikings* via Old English, and still survives in Scandinavia in the form of jul and jultid (Christmas and Christmastime), although in Britain it is now mostly used for rhyming or punning purposes in headlines (\"Yule duel rage\", \"uncool Yule rules\", \"Yule feel fabulous\" are recent examples) and phrases like \"Yule log\". It is also used by pagans to refer to the winter solstice.* Or possibly the Angles and Saxons; the OED describes its origins as \"Teutonic\"."},
{"title": "Poleaxed", "date": "Wednesday 16 December 2009", "text": "There are many kinds of truth. Al Gore was poleaxed by an inconvenient one yesterday.   - The Times talking about Al Gore and the ArcticI think poleaxe is a pun. I'm not sure; but I think it is. North poleaxed. Do you see? The other week I actually woke up an unfortunate journalist on a Saturday morning to complain about a mild pun in an article only to discover that it had been completely unintentional. With The Sun you pretty much know that a pun is a pun. Puns in The Sun are out and proud and shoving the proverbial \"it\" down your throat. In the broadsheets puns tend to linger and loiter on the page trying not to attract attention. If challenged they will concede that yes they are puns, but no they never intended to actually make you laugh.Anyway, I didn't know what a poleaxe was. They have nothing to do with poles, and everything to do with polls. A pollaxe (ax if you're efficient and American) was a medieval axe that was used to hit people over the head or poll. A poll as (as in Gallup) is a headcount, just as a poll tax is a tax on heads and a tadpole is a toad-head (tadpole used to be slang for a child, then got shortened to tad, then started to mean anything small, hence \"move it a tad to the left\"). A tadpole can also be called a polliwog, or wriggling head.With the arrival of gunpowder, cannons and light-sabres pollaxes were driven from battlefield and confined themselves to abattoirs where they were used to kill or simply stun cattle, hence the modern use of poleaxed to mean stunned or paralysed. It's sad that this should have happened to Emile Heskey, but I'm sure it's the way he would have wanted to go.A polecat, on the other hand is a cat that eats chickens or poules.I'm still not certain that poleaxed was a pun. I'd go and wake up the writer, but there were three of them - Hannah Devlin, Ben Webster, Philippe Naughton - and I don't know where any of them sleep.Yet.Uses for a polecatI thought, as Christmas is coming and a pandemic of obesity sweeps the goose population, Inky Fool could offer a little choice of pedantic books as stocking fillers, complete with sample passages demonstrating their linguistic rectitude and links to Amazon. The Girls of Slender Means by Muriel Spark is about a group of young ladies in London at the end of the Second World War. They are all slightly in love with a poor poet and an expensive dress. The reason for recommendation is this passage where a man called Rudi is reading out a political tract:   There is a kind of truth in the popular idea of an anarchist as a wild man with a home-made bomb in his pocket. In modern times this bomb, fabricated in the back workshops of the imagination, can only take one effective form: Ridicule.   Jane said, '\"Only take\" isn't grammatical, it should be \"take only\". I'll have to change that, Rudi.The Tetherballs of Bougainville by Mark Leyner is a simple story about a young man who, when his father's execution in a New Jersey penitentiary fails, runs off to Bougainville with a mysterious talking orang-utan and writes propaganda for the breakaway de facto government. The reason for recommendation is this passage wherein our hero remembers how his father used to help him with homework:   All of a sudeen Dad grabbed the mouse and highlighted a line on the computer screen, and he said, \"That's a non-restrictive modifier. It needs to be set off by a commas.\"   I probably said something to the effect of, \"It's not a big deal, Dad, let's just leave it out.\"   At which point he went completely beserk. \"It's a non-restrictive adjectival phrase. It's not essential to the meaning of the sentence's main clause. It should be set off by commas. It is a big deal!\"   And he grabbed a souvenir scrimshaw engraving tool, which I'd gotten at the New Bedford Whaling Museum gift shop several summers ago, and he plunged it into his left thigh, I'd say at least two to three inches deep.   \"All right, I'll put the commas in,\" I said.The Rachel Papers was Martin Amis' first novel and was about a young man running around London in the seventies trying to get laid (mainly by a girl called Rachel) and cram for the Oxford Entrance Exam. I've always had a soft spot for it as I read it back when I was (chastely) cramming for the Oxford Entrance Exam. The reason for recommendation is, inter almost all alia, this passage:   The Practical Criticism Paper. I explicated a Donne sonnet and paid uncomprehending lip-service to a beefy dirge by someone called John Skelton. there was a D. H. Lawrence essay on how passionate and truthful D. H. Lawrence was: a characteristic piece of small-cocked doggerel  which I treated with characteristic knowingness. Finally, I belaboured one of Gerard Manley Hopkins's sleazier lyrics, implying (a last-minute reread made clear) that it was a high time we burned all extant editions of the little fag's poetry; emendations took the form of replacing some of the 'ands' with 'buts', and of changing the odd 'moreover' to 'however'.The last recommendation is Goodbye to Berlin by Christopher Isherwood which is (besides being the basis for the film/musical Cabaret) a careful depiction of Berlin in the 1930s. The reason for recommendation is, obscurely, this exchange:   'And tell me, please, do you find German girls different than English girls?'   I blushed. 'Do you find German girls . . .' I began to correct her and stopped, realizing just in time that I wasn't absolutely sure whether one says different from or different to.Now I'm off to buy socks for my family.Oh, you shouldn't have."},
{"title": "Halcyon Days", "date": "Tuesday 15 December 2009", "text": "Today (or possibly yesterday, but I forgot) is the first of the Halcyon Days which will last until just before the end of December. The Halcyon Days are the fortnight of supposedly calm weather in midwinter during which the halcyon, or kingfisher, lays her eggs. The eminent biologist/meteorologist Ovid explains that Ceyx and Alcyone were lovers. Ceyx had to go to sea for some reason and every day Alcyone (the girl) would go down to the shore to look for his returning vessel. She continued this vigil until she was informed by the utterly reliable medium of a dream that the ship had sunk and Ceyx had drowned. At this news, as Chaucer so movingly put it,\"Allas!\" quod she for sorweAnd deyede within the thridde morwe.[quod=said sorwe=sorrow deyede=died thridde=third morwe=day]Anyway, everybody was terribly upset including the gods who decided on their tried and tested fall-back plan of turning both the lovers into birds (avification was only just behind stellafication in the Attic list of divine mercies).The gods then went further and decided to make the sea calm and the weather bright for one fortnight a year starting on the 14th/15th of December so that the Alcyon could explore and develop her newfound egg-laying capabilities, for which I'm sure the young lady was profoundly grateful.Anyway, the usual modern sense of the halcyon days as being the happy days before all the trouble started is a figurative extension of this precise ornithometeorlogical usage.Note the wings formingWriting about attributive nouns and noun compounds reminded me of one of the most striking characteristics of journalese, particularly tabloid journalese. When not indulging in wordplay or mysterious literary allusions, newspaper sub-editors will often construct headlines out of nothing but nouns. These virtuoso displays of noun-compounding, although they bear very litle relation to everyday English, are delightfully efficient. Every word carries weight and meaning, making them perfect for squeezing as much information into headlines as possible. Sometimes, though, they are so compressed that you have to read the story to find out what the headline means, making them more like teasers than summaries.Here are a couple of examples from Saturday's Sun:Harry jury time plea(Harry+jury) + (time+plea)Two noun compounds - \"Harry jury\", meaning the jury trying a teenager who poured bleach over somebody's head during the screening of a Harry Potter film, and \"time plea\", meaning \"request for more time to consider a verdict\", bolted together to make a single noun compound.UKIP vid \"leak\" rap((UKIP+vid) + leak) + rapThis is built up in a slightly different way. \"UKIP vid\" is the first noun compound - meaning the video of a prospective UKIP MEP being interviewed. \"Leak\" is added onto the end to make a new compound meaning the posting of that video on YouTube. Finally, \"rap\" is added to make a third compound, referring to the court ruling that UKIP must compensate the candidate for posting the video.The Mirror offers this example:Pope abuse sympathyPope + (abuse+sympathy)In this case, the primary noun compound comes at the end - \"abuse sympathy\", meaning \"sympathy for victims of abuse\". This is modified by \"Pope\", so it means \"Pope's sympathy for victims of abuse\".Tabloid headlines also use noun compounds as shorthand for referring to people in the news. The rather depressing selection from my copy of The Sun includes: \"Maddie cop\"; \"acid girl\" (girl who survived an acid attack, although it could equally refer to a girl involved in making, taking or selling LSD); \"carjack brute\"; \"tot death ma\"; \"drug dad\"; \"Guy pal\" (friend of Guy Ritchie) and \"porn Sir\".Update: Language Log has several entertaining posts on this topic: here, here and here."},
{"title": "Italian Italics", "date": "Monday 14 December 2009", "text": "I was about to write a terribly amusing post about pushing the envelope when my eyes drifted up the column in the dictionary to entrepreneur. It was in italics because it was foreign, exactly the same as its gallic abecedenarian neighbour entre nous. So I flicked back through the dictionary. It's an old one that is used as much for door-stopping as it is for reference. It was a revised 5th edition from 1964. What surprised me was that I don't think that I have ever seen entrepreneur in italics (except perhaps in that famous, probably apocryphal, bushism). Some time between 1964 and my terrifying emergence into basic literacy it must have acquired British nationality and therefore shed the italics that we use for mots etrangers.It's strange the amount of time this process takes. The italics, I feel, ask of the reader that he assume the accent of the foreign language, which is reasonably easy for French but an awful lot more perplexing when with a word like smorgasbord or fakir (despite many attempts I have never been able to pronounce a single Scandinavian vowel, instead I just sound like an excited sealion). It's even odder when you read an old book that needed to italicise a word with which we are all now familiar. I was once reading a novel* from the first half of the twentieth century which said something along the lines of \"The spaghetti that they ate was delicious\", which made me try to mentally repatriate the word.Schadenfreude currently seems to have dual nationality, but is almost a full citizen. A brief google shows that nobody is quite sure on the subject (in the same way nobody seems sure whether to capitalise g/Google). I found italicised and unitalicised examples in all four of the broadsheets. I've often heard it said that schadenfreude is a German word because it is a peculiarly German emotion, in the same way that Eskimos are often said to have a whole drift of words for snow. But this doesn't seem to take account of our very own gloating and smirking, verbs almost always performed at the expense of others.In case you were wondering, contemporary schadenfreude/schadenfreude seems confined to Tiger Woods, association football and Dubai. Don't gloat*I thought this was Where Angels Fear to Tread (1904), but having checked my Penguin Classics edition I find the word in ordinary roman. Perhaps it was Evelyn Waugh, I can't remember and can't be bothered to re-read every book I possess."},

{"title": "From Portobello Road to Mount Vernon with a Hangover", "date": "Saturday 12 December 2009", "text": "In 1739 Admiral Edward Vernon led the British assault on Porto Bello in what's now Panama. He took just six ships but with lots of derring do and British pluck etc etc he won a startling victory. So startling was the victory in fact that a patriotic agrarian heard the news, dashed off to the countryside west of London, and built Portobello Farm in honour of the victory's startlingness. Green's Lane, which was nearby, soon became known as Portobello Lane and then Portobello Road and so the market (apparently the largest antiques market in the world) is called Portobello Market.But Admiral Vernon's naming exploits did not end there. In 1740 he got a new officer called Lawrence Washington, who had been recruited from the British dominions in North America. Lawrence Washington ran around bravely shooting lots of Spaniards and then returned home to be with his brother George (who also has some minor role in history). So much did Lawrence love his old commanding officer that he renamed the family estate Mount Vernon.But Admiral Vernon's naming exploits did not end there. When the seas were stormy he used to wear a thick coat made out of a coarse material called grogram (from the French gros graine). So he was known to his men as Old Grog.British sailors used to have daily allowance of rum. In 1740 flushed from victory at Porto Bello and perhaps under the pernicious influence of Lawrence Washington, Vernon ordered that the rum be watered down. The resulting mixture, which eventually became standard for the whole navy, was known as grog. If you drank to much grog you became drunk or groggy. My battered Concise Oxford Dictionary still has groggy down as meaning drunk. But the word has slipped through the night and in the chic dipsomaniac circles in which I move groggy now means hungover. This means that I have visited two places named after the same chap and woken up with him.Old Grog"},
{"title": "Backlash", "date": "Friday 11 December 2009", "text": "I had always thought that a backlash had something to do with whips. Specifically, I thought that it was the reverse stroke, when the whipper's arm is being pulled up ready to strike, and there is a danger that the whip might strike an innocent bystander. Here is an illustration of my imaginings.It fits the usual sense of the term perfectly: the violence that is being directed one way requires that it should suddenly be flicked back from the victim towards those who thought they were safe. Indeed, it looks here as though the chap in the white vest has turned his head to avoid the cat-o'-four-tails that the whipper is irresponsibly allowing to fly out into his blind spot. I can only assume that health and safety regulations were not as advanced in first century Judaea as they are now.I was thinking about this because I read in the paper today that \"the backlash over the golfer's sexual liaisons could eat him alive.\"So I cast imagination to the sewer and decided to look it up. Backlash has nothing whatsoever to do with whips. It is, instead a property of cogwheels. No two connecting cogs can ever fit perfectly. If they did the friction would stop them moving at all. Moreover, in most systems a metal cog could heat up slightly and expand locking the device completely. As a result, you have to leave some room between the teeth and this space is called a backlash. A backlash doesn't do much except when you reverse the system. In the diagram above the bottom wheel is turning anticlockwise. That means that if you start turning it clockwise there will be a moment of stillness before the tooth on the bottom left connects with the upper wheel and starts to move it. Moving diagram here. Video here.Well, this stymied me. It means that the usual sense of backlash to mean a violent reaction is utterly wrong. The backlash is the empty period, it is the blank at the bottom of the page, it is the gap between songs, it is the please wait while your request is being processed.But if a golfer were to get caught between the teeth of a very, very big gear system, I have to concede that he could be eaten alive.Just so any whip enthusiasts don't get too disappointed, \"enough room to swing a cat\" is probably to do with a cat-o'-nine-tails.P.S. Anyone interested in how much room is actually needed for feline swinging should check here. It's 10'1\" for me, but obviously varies with height/size of mog."},
{"title": "Naughty Noughty", "date": "Thursday 10 December 2009", "text": "As the clever hopes expireOf a low dishonest decadeSome Australians have run a competition to see what to call the next one. They have concluded that the years of our Lord 2010-2019 should be called the One-ders. They give two reasons for this:1. There is hope for many scientific, humanitarian and environmental breakththroughs. 2. The inclusion of number one in every yearFor some reason, upon reading this my fists started to spasm and I could think about nothing other than ritual dismemberment involved in the Viking blood-eagle sacrifice. But that's by the by. More important is that nobody seems to agree on what to call the decade towards the end of which we are wearily trudging. Most newspapers dodge the issue by referring to the 2000's. Newsreaders tend to ge out of it with \"this decade\", \"this century\" or \"since the millenium\" and, if pushed, refer to the \"two thousands\". Once you're on to the laxity of the review section the name becomes the noughties. This seems far more common, though, in Britain (380 recent uses) than in America (a mere 46).Noughties is obviously a pun on naughty and suggests the naughty nineties of Wilde, Whistler, Dowson and all those other sinners. The thing about the naughty/noughty pun is that the etymology of the two words is the same. A wight with no possessions was a nowight or nought/naught. Such people tend to be criminals and are therefore naughty.Naughty used to be a far more serious word. When I arrested Conrad for deceiving the duke and maligning a girl so terribly that she had to fake her own death I called him a \"naughty varlet\", and that wasn't just me mixing up my words: Leonato used the word naughty too. It's a bit of problem for Shakespeare. I remember the whispered titter that overtook the National Theatre once when I was watching King Lear and Gloucester, having his eyes torn out, calls Regan a \"naughty lady\".But of course like so many words it has been used too much in exaggeration and disobedient children were being called naughty by the 1630s. Incidentally, aught, to mean nothing is simply a metanalysis from a naught to an aught, in the way that the snake called a nadder became an adder.I don't know what to call the next decade. As I believe I said before: Dost thou not suspect my years?Me arresting a naughty varletA few days ago I noticed an ad for \"the funnest iPod ever\". Despite having gone through a phase of using “funner” and “funnest” when I was young and foolish, I still felt a little pedantic and prickly about Apple using its marketing might to popularise what some still view as a “ghastly”, “grating and horrifying” word. I wonder whether the use of the non-standard superlative was deliberate - possibly to make a banal slogan less banal and more fun - or whether it is entirely unselfconscious: a quotation from Steve Jobs, perhaps, or a reflection of the way people speak in techworld.A more important question is why \"fun\" and \"funner\" should be considered wrong, while almost all other short adjectives ending in a consonant take -er and -est in the comparative and superlative (here is a link to a simple table showing the rules for comparatives and superlatives). WorldWideWords and Grammar Girl (in a response to Steve Jobs' use of the word at a press conference) explain that this is because \"fun\" was not, historically speaking, an adjective at all, but a noun.It started being used as an attributive noun (a noun which modifies other nouns) in the nineteenth century, with phrases such as “fun-room”, “funfair” and “fun-fest” creeping into use. It is only recently that it has made the transition to being an adjective, and even now not all dictionaries accept it as one – my online OED only lists it as a noun and a verb (meaning to “make fun or sport”). As a result, fun is still treated like a noun when forming comparatives and superlatives - so it is \"more fun\" and the \"most fun\", like \"more sugar\" or the \"most sugar\". Grammar Girl explains it thus:“Even people who accept that \"fun\" is an adjective are unlikely to embrace \"funner\" and \"funnest.\" It seems as if language mavens haven't truly gotten over their irritation that “fun” has become an adjective, and they've decided to dig in their heels against “funner” and “funnest.” In their minds, if “fun” as an adjective is still informal, then the inflected forms are still “nonstandard,” or to use less fussy words—“funnest” is grating and horrifying. And the language mavens still have enough influence to hold the line for now”.Incidentally, I have noticed that some non-native speakers of English use \"funny\" as an adjective meaning “fun”, which is entirely logical, in that it does derive from the noun “fun” (and has been around much longer than “fun” as an adjective). However, it always seems to have had the specific sense of “comical”.On another slightly tangential note, I have noticed that another set of adjectives which don’t seem to follow the normal rules are adjectives of nationality. Words like “French”, “Dutch”, “Greek” and “Swiss” should in theory act like other one-syllable words ending in consonants, but I have never heard anyone use “Frencher” to mean “more French” (as in, “it’s more French to cook that way”, or “this bistro feels more French than the other one”).

{"title": "Bish bash bosh", "date": "Tuesday 8 December 2009", "text": "Today I heard two of my colleagues use the phrase “bish bash bosh”, to demonstrate the ease and efficiency of something they had accomplished (“I called the client, explained the situation and bish, bash, bosh”). Like “ding, dang, dong” (the sound made by the bells in Frère Jacques) or “Ping, Pang, Pong” (a Japanese drinking game or the names of the courtiers in Turandot, depending on your frame of reference) it has an appealing if slightly nonsensical air and I was sufficiently struck by the phrase to try to find out where it had come from (my colleagues having no idea). It seems that it was popularised by comedian Harry Enfield in his Loadsamoney sketch. The first newspaper references I can find – in the late 1980s – all refer to Harry Enfield, with the phrase gaining wider currency throughout the late nineties and into the 2000s (almost ten years in, I’m still not sure about the “noughties”). Bish, bash, bosh - look at his doshThere are earlier references in song titles (there is a jazz song “Bish Bash Bosh”, written by Barry Harris in 1962), and, according to The Guardian, in novels – a recent book review by Steven Poole states that the phrase “the bish-bash-bosh of freemasonry”, whatever that means, appears in a 1924 novel. I am not sure whether this means the phrase was in fairly wide use before Harry Enfield’s lighting on it, or whether he, like Barry Harris and the mysterious 1920s author, invented it independently of each other. The construction – three one-syllable nonsense words, with the noun changing from “i” to “a” to “o” – seems like a fairly intuitive one, if the examples above are anything to go by.UPDATE - Dogberry points out that tic tac, mishmash, Kit Kat, knick knack, hiphop, clip clop and tick tock, ping pong, sing song, ding dong, and king kong all fit a truncated version of the pattern - an \"i\" followed by an \"o\" or an \"a\". So do flimflam, chit-chat, bric-a-brac (almost) and Mary Poppins' catchphrase \"spit spot\". Other phrases using all three vowels are \"Slip, slap, slop\" (as in \"slip on a shirt, slap on a hat, and slop on some sunscreen\") and Spike Milligan's On the Ning Nang Nong. There is a long list of similar words here - the \"i\" followed by \"a\" or \"o\" pattern seems remarkably prevalent.Spit spot, and off we go...This type of vowel alternation is known as ablaut, and the construction of phrases using vowels in this sequence is known as \"ablaut reduplication\" or \"ablaut-motivated compounding\". According to this grammatical essay, the \"a\", \"i\", \"o\"/\"u\" sequence is the most common because these three vowels are the the \"fundamental pillars on which the whole system of vocalisation has been constructed\", with \"i\" at one end of the spectrum (at the front of the mouth) \"o\" or \"u\" at the other (at the back of the mouth) and \"a in the middle. The sequence is not just found in English - the essay cited above notes that phrases like \"piff paff\", \"piff puff\", \"bim bam\", and \"bim bum\" are also found in German.Some English irregular verbs also follow this pattern. Those with three vowels include ring/rang/rung, sing/sang/sung, drink/drank/drunk, sink/sank/sunk, and shrink/shrank/shrunk. Those with two include hang /hung, sit/sat, and spit/spat.Middle English had even more examples of irregular verbs using ablaut, like chide/chode, climb/clomb and help/holp. But, as this essay by a group of Harvard maths graduates reports, these have gradually died out and been replaced by regular forms, with the least frequently used disappearing first. The paper predicts that \"wed\" will be the next to go, with \"wedded\" replacing it as the past participle.I know this blog is meant to celebrate the vicissitudes of the English language, but I would just like to spice it up with a foreign offering, which I discovered this summer and I think trumps its English counterpart, \"champagne socialist.\"The much chic-er French version, in my view, is \"gauche caviar.\"The Yanks apparently use \"limousine liberal\" or even \"mastercard marxist.\" So obvious, darling.We British, meanwhile, continue to flaunt the national propensity for booze with the alternative, \"bollinger bolshevik.\"Whichever you prefer, these days, when even the Conservatives are banned from drinking champagne, all suggest a bygone age of political glamour.

It can't last because gambit is dead, it has fallen into the terrible linguistic oubliette of being a technical term that nobody knows about. A word cannot serve two masters: conversation and precision.A gambit, technically speaking, is a series of opening moves in chess in which a piece is sacrificed for the sake of a positional advantage. Opening gambits are therefore tautologous. Saying \"Nice weather we've been having lately\" is not a conversational gambit, unless you are trying to trick a meteorologist. A gambit, technically, must have some sense of either deception or sacrifice. Otherwise it's just... well it isn't anything. It's a start.But of course 99% of the population don't know that, so unless you're actually chatting to Kasparov it's utterly Quixotic to use gambit in its technical sense. Mr Jenkins, though correct, had to add the words \"bought\" and \"hook, line and sinker\" to frame the meaning. If, after falling out with someone, I call them up and admit that I partly wrong in the hope that they would do the same, I could call that a conversational gambit, but few readers would know the implications of the word unless I explained them.So you're a fool if you think you can still use gambit correctly, but you will be thought a fool by some if you use it incorrectly.The word is dead. Chess journalists, I suppose, can continue to use it. But for the rest of us gambit has spent two long splitting: retaining a technical meaning whilst wandering the mean streets of verbiage.The same probably goes for a quantum leap. A quantum leap is a sudden movement, a sort of magical shift, but it is terribly, terribly, terribly tiny. In fact, it is the smallest shift possible in nature, which is why there is no between. I know that quantum physicists are not a large part of anyone's coterie, but why display your ignorance to the fury of pedants like a babooness in heat madly presenting her swollen rump to the mercy of the pack?Oh, and a blueprint is not a preliminary sketch, it is the final plan delivered to the factory.Is this who you want to be?I once bought a Gillette Mach 3 Turbo razor. I made this purchase on the understanding that it would move at three times the speed of sound (it was after all invoking the name of Ernst Mach) and further that the razor would use the power of its own engine to funnel back compressed air into its combustion chamber. That's what turbo means. I didn't know why a razor would have an internal combustion engine, but it was precisely this curiousity that led me to make the purchase.A day later, I stormed back into the chemist and started haranguing, accusing, cajoling and condemning the young deceiver behind the counter who had the cheek to feign innocence.I once (truly) engaged in an e-mail correspondence with a fellow from Dell Computers asking him if I qualified for the free executive carry-case when I wasn't an executive. He seemed confused, but I did actually manage to get his assurance in writing that executives have the same hand-shape as other humans.Someday, when I have more money than thirst, I'm going to go on a rampage of barratry suing any seller of tandoori that is not made in a clay oven. Moreover, I'm going to put a huge series of posters on the Tube showing the actual Jack Daniels Distillery. I do not believe that that company has managed to get a bottle of sugary raccoon urine into every bar in the world on the basis of two slow-moving rustics called Jeb and a horse-drawn cart.Is that so, Santa?"},

It was about Charles Darwin and at one point he was talking about how he hadn't enjoyed training as a doctor: 'All those wretched patients,' he said.And there was a flicker in my mind. Did he mean by this that the patients were in a wretched condition, or did he mean that he didn't like them, as in 'I hate all these wretched rules'?I once heard somebody described as a \"fucking virgin\", and another time a girl told me that she wouldn't sleep with a man, adding \"fuck him\". The dainty Roy Keane (whom I have always considered a latter-day Swinburne) once told the Ireland manager Mick McCarthy that he was a \"fucking wanker\" which would, if you think about it, be a remarkable feat of multitasking.Words become expletives, voiding themselves of meaning, and then, as their fifteen minutes of rudeness passes, they get their meaning back. Dashed means something again. Nowadays only complexions are ruddy, heaths and cannons blasted.A quick glance at the news makes me think that wretched now refers almost exclusively to those things characteristic of the outcast wretch.So perhaps fucking virgins will one day be a puzzling oxymoron, we will move on to other, as yet undreamt of oaths and wonder why so many nouns of the twentieth century, even abstract ones, copulated.That is the ancient soul/Of wretched Myrrha"},
{"title": "Hidebound and Toeing the Line", "date": "Friday 4 December 2009", "text": "I was reading something just now that used the word hidebound. I'd always sort of assumed that this alluded to old books, bound with hide, from which a hidebound reactionary would take his opinions. But in a momentary spirit of actually finding something out I looked it up and discovered that it just means that the skin on the hindquarters is so tight that an animal has difficulty moving. In humans this may mean scleroderma, which is chronic.Luckily the chap I was reading about was not hidebound and indeed refused to toe the line, as I was with a dictionary already I discovered that the etymology of this word was uncertain, but may refer to the rule in the House of Commons that members must not stand forward of one of two lines that are, apparently, a sword's length apart. This is to make sure that neither Gordon Brown nor David Cameron ever actually drive home their points.I once went to the chamber of the House of Commons and was told that I wasn't allowed to sit down on the sacred green benches. Fortunately there was a very big chap there and I was able to put him between the guide and me and take the weight off my feet (I'm 6'1\" so this was a terribly big guy).I then went to the viewing gallery of the House of Lords (I forget why but most people in the House of Lords have forgotten something) where they have a little curtain at the level of your feet. This is, apparently, so that the debating peers don't catch a glimpse of a lady's ankle and let matters of state slip.You see that red bit at the bottom of the balcony? That's the ankle curtain.I came. I saw. I conquered.I came; I saw; I conquered.I came, I saw, I conquered.All grammatically viable, but the voices are different. Punctuation, as I have said before, is all about signalling in what voice something should be read. So here, for what it's worth, is my ha'penny's worth.The way I reckon it the full stops make it sound as if you're marking the sentences out with your hands: perhaps banging three times on a conference table with your big hairy hands, perhaps thrusting your index finger towards your interlocutor's face on each verb. Maybe spitting slightly. It's how I would write out a Hitler speech. I think all the words would be delivered at the same pitch.The semicolons, on the other hand, make it sound like Churchill. It's being said slowly, but with a single cadence running through it. Came would be highest pitch and conquered lowest. I think there could even be a bigger pause on the ;s than on the .s.The commas make it sound like Bertie Wooster: a sort of devil-may-care off-the-cuffishness. 'What did I do today? Golly, Brutus, I'm not sure. Oh, that's it. I came, I saw, I conquered. That sort of thing, I suppose. Care for a drink?'That's how I read them anyway. Many people are worried about the near extinction of the semicolon. They sit at home and weep over its absence like a doting mother whose octuplet sons have all run away to sea. The reason for ;'s apparent scarcity is, I think, not that people don't know how to use it, but that most don't want to sound like Churchill. They have no ambition, you see.Most style guides would have you write like Hitler.It's also worthwhile remembering that the first writer to really use the semicolon was Ben Jonson. Shakespeare and Chaucer seem to have to got by without. The ; was invented by Aldus Manutius, who also invented italics.Useful; chap"},

{"title": "Chaucer and Poets' Corner", "date": "Wednesday 2 December 2009", "text": "According to today's Times there's a campaign to put up a memorial to Ted Hughes in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. Seamus Heaney, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1995, Sir Andrew Motion, the former Poet Laureate, and Lord Bragg of Wigton, the author and broadcaster, are among those who have written to the Dean of Westminster calling for Hughes to be included. [I love the the perennial \"calling\" of the news]Simply because your life wouldn't be worth living if you didn't know: Poet's Corner should really be called the Lying-Around-With-Chaucer Corner.Geoffrey, you see, took a 53-year lease on a house beside Westminster Abbey on Christmas Eve 1399. It was on the site of what's now the Henry VII Chapel. It was a place to live, nothing more. Less than a year later he had died (of natural causes despite what crazed ex-Pythons may imagine).So he was buried in Westminster Abbey simply because it was his parish church: nothing to do with his being a poet. Indeed, if any excuse were needed, his being an MP and civil servant may have helped. Edmund Spenser was buried nearby in 1599 and so the poet idea took hold.As we're on the subject of Chaucer and death, here is Geoffrey rhyming craftily about a man being led to his execution:Have ye nat seyn sometyme a pale face,Among a prees, of hym that hath be ladToward his deeth, wher as hym gat no grace,And swich a colour in his face hath hadMen myghte knowe his face that was bistadAmonges alle the faces in that route?[prees=crowd, lad=led, swich=such, bistad=in trouble]That, to putte othir men in rémembraunceOf his persone, I have heere his lyknesseP.S.

{"title": "Data, Singulars and Plurals", "date": "Tuesday 1 December 2009", "text": "The data were gathered from weather stations around the world...I nearly spilled my coffee all over the Sunday Times article. A typo? No.Jones was not in charge of the CRU when the data were thrown away...I know all about the notion that data is plural. I have seen the complaints; but I had never before seen data used as a plural outside of the pages of a style guide. It's like graffiti: any Italian will tell you it's plural and so will Fowler and his ilk, but nobody writes like that. I mean style guides are all very pleasant to read, but nobody, I thought, acted on them. Data is there to complain about, not actually pluralise.Data is one of those words that have been picked out at random for special pleading. It is, in Latin, a second declension neuter plural nomintative. But the same argument is never made about agenda and stamina, both of which are also Latin plurals. Nobody ever says, 'My stamina are failing,' nor does any pedant or grammarian suggest that one should. There's a list of 55 Latin plurals here.Gallows was originally a plural (because a gallows is made from several pieces of wood or galgi). But the word was already singular in Shakespeare's time (the gallows is built stronger than the church). I even used to know an enthusiastic scholar of breakfasts who insisted that porridge was plural as it was a shortening of porridge oats: so 'How are your porridge?'Etymology is no guide to number, and the grammar of a dead and foreign tongue cannot be applied to English (otherwise you would have to say \"interpretations of the datorum vary\" (it is strange that the rules tend to stretch to the little learning of the pedant)). Fjords would have to be fjorder, as in the Norwegian. When discussing Alans Hansen and Shearer you would have to go further and discover what the Hindi plural of pundit is. We would all have to return to proto Indo-European grammar and there would be a great hush.People write angry letters to the paper when data is singular, but the reader receives a strange jolt when the word is plural. One maniac correspondent wrote \"I rebel at the phrase 'the data shows' which has become well-nigh universal\", which means I suppose that he is reacting against the universe. If a usage is universal, it is correct. Fowler said that the word was 'plural only', but that was half a century ago. One might as well insist that the second person singular be thou.The truth?All of this comes under one simple rule that Bill Bryson and Kingsley Amis both agree on: number in English grammar is controlled by thought.A gin and tonic is a drink, despite there being two nouns, because the drink is a single idea. One could conceivably say that gin and tonic are both ingredients in a gin and tonic, but it would be awkward. Fish and chips is a meal. Law and order (if considered as a single idea) is breaking down. The long and the short of it IS that:Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrowCreeps [singular] into this petty placeThe Telegraph is therefore correct to write that \"ministers have insisted that the Olympics is 'on budget'\", because the budget would be for the games as a whole: a single idea.Conversely, a singular noun can be treated as a plural. The couple are in love with each other. One could not reasonably say that the couple is in love with itself. The National Youth Orchestra are all in their teens, but the National Youth Orchestra is 61 years old. It depends how you're thinking about it/them.Data is singular so long as I consider it so and plural when the whim strikes me. Teams, orchestras, armies, quintets, convocations, councils, countries, sets, groups, flocks, herds, prides and opera must bend  and bow to my ineffable will.There is, of course, mistakes in number. Often a writer forgets, after a subordinate clause, how many subjects their verb had.  People forget that neither or nor nor give the plural. There are cases, occasional and rare - perhaps once in a century, that requires that two words distant in meaning cannot reasonably be considered a single idea. I even noticed in a previous post that I had made a country singular and then plural with no reason for the change, a shift that Fowler rightly objects to.As a bit of trivia (another second declension nominative neuter plural), plus, being a preposition, does not change the number of a noun. One and one are two, but one plus one is two. \"Tom, plus his friends, has arrived.\"And then there are those confused serpents like Mr Fry who think that none has to be singular. It does not. Evidence and video are to be found in my previous post here.How many legs?P.S. There's a Polish word that's plural but used as a singular in English, but I can't for the life of me remember what it is. Anybody?"},
{"title": "Estate agent's dictionary", "date": "Tuesday 1 December 2009", "text": "Charming post with original features; ideal for first-time readersMy first job was as a Saturday assistant in an estate agency, where I spent fruitless hours trying to persuade the manager to correct his offences against grammar, spelling and common sense. What I didn't realise at the time was that estate agents live in an alternative reality of \"ideally located split-level maisonettes\" and \"spaciously arranged family bathrooms\", and that any attempt to impose everyday language and style was ultimately doomed to failure.For anyone else grappling with the inanities of property marketing, I have begun to compile an estate agent's dictionary...please let me know if you have any suggestions.Arguably – A useful weasel word which can be used to preface any high-flown but un-provable assertion. As in “arguably one of the most attractive roads in Hampstead”, “arguably the best 2 bed penthouses in Sheffield”, or this wonderfully prolix example: “Arguably the finest example of an idyllic 16th century grand hall in an elevated riverside setting - in Ribble Valley”. Arranged over – (As in “arranged over the second floor”). On – could also mean that it takes up the whole second floor as opposed to just being carved out of a section of it.Benefits from – Has. Often applies to something which is not, strictly speaking, a benefit – e.g. “benefits from an open-plan kitchen” – who wants a kitchen in their sitting room?Boasts – Has.Character – (As in “brimming with character”) Not bland and beige, but may not be to everyone’s taste. May also suggest an impractical layout or other inconveniences. “Quirky” or “unusual” are similar terms.Charming – Like “super”, “funky” and other vague terms of approbation, pretty much meaningless. A study by Freakonomics author Steven D. Levitt found that words like “charming”, which don’t refer to anything specific about the property, were associated with a lower sale price.Close to/ within walking distance of/ within easy reach of – Vague. Could mean anything up to a fifteen-minute walk. But could also mean \"right on top of\" (in the way that \"convenient for train station\" often means \"facing the railway tracks\").Compact/Bijou - Very small.Dining hall - In the absence of a proper dining room, this phrase is used to describe a hallway which is big enough to squeeze in a dining table.Duplex/split-level – Officially means a flat across two or more floors; but many estate agents will describe a flat as split level even if it just has a “mezzanine” loo halfway up the stairs, or an entrance hall on a separate level to the main flat. Family bathroom - Bathroom which is not en suite. Doesn't have anything to do with size (as in a \"family-sized pack\" of something in the supermarket).Feature fireplace - Fireplace.Ideally located in – Located in. Ideal for first-time buyers or rental investors – Cheap but unattractive; if you could afford anything better, you wouldn’t want to live there yourself.Neat, tidy - Small. Nothing to do with actual neatness, since - unless it was being sold complete with the previous owner's clutter  - why would it matter?Offers the opportunity to create your dream home - In need of a total overhaul.Pied a terre - Very small.Proportional accommodation – The flat is too small for the estate agent to get away with the word “spacious”, but the layout arguably makes sensible use of what space there is. Receiving hall - Square hallway, presumably big enough to greet visitors in.Sought-after – (As in “sought-after location”). Meaningless; can safely be used to describe any road, even the cheapest, ugliest or scariest in any particular area.Spacious – Usually meaningless. If a property or room is spacious, you can see this on the floorplan, or the estate agent will give measurements. For \"deceptively spacious\", see this post.Unofficial roof terrace - The roof of the extension to the floor below, which can only be accessed by climbing out of the window. May be decorated with pot plants and a sun lounger to make it look more like an official roof terrace.Up and coming - To be fair, this can mean an area which is in the process of gentrification (artists, young professionals, Starbucks, chichi bakeries and everything else that entails). But it can also mean an area which is still resolutely gritty, with no cupcakes or coffee chains in sight; all you can safely assume is that the area is not yet \"established\". (Thanks to Everet Lapel at the fabulous Foam and Skies for this update). Within this large/imposing/grand building – The word “large” is being used to distract from the fact that the flat itself is not large at all.Yards from the amenities of a popular local supermarket – At the bottom of the Tesco car park (This comes from a local ad; I thought it was an impressive attempt at spin).The direct approach"},
{"title": "Mind games - the difference between \"brain\" and \"mind\"", "date": "Monday 30 November 2009", "text": "There's a poster at my local railway station which never fails to catch my attention. It reads (in classic question and answer, feed and punchline style) :\"What went through the mind of the person who slipped on the platform?\" \"The floor.\" While I admire the wordplay and admit that it is effective as a health and safety notice - the shift from a thought running through someone's head to a piece of concrete smashing into it is as jarring as it is supposed to be - there is something that doesn't quite work.I think it is to do with the difference between \"mind\" and \"brain\". Because \"mind\" is seldom used in a physical, biological sense, the pun feels like something of a cheat - you simply wouldn't refer to the floor \"going through someone's mind\" unless you meant that they were thinking about it.Brains are biological; minds are psychological. A neurosurgeon operates on the brain, not the mind; if someone described themselves as a \"mind doctor\" you would be more likely to assume they were a psychoanalyst, or even a hypnotist. The meaning of \"brain\" is somewhat broader - the phrase \"to have something on the brain\" more often refers to thoughts than to biological conditions - but, as a noun, \"mind\" almost never refers to the physical brain.Would \"brain\", with its double meaning of the seat of thought and the physical organ, have been a better choice? I think so, although, because is is more closely associated with the latter sense than with the former, the shock in the shift of meaning would not have been so great. My choice would have been \"head\", which works equally well in both contexts. The wordplay on \"running through someone's mind\" reminds me of another pun with a far less serious aim. Although I have never heard it used (I must be associating with the wrong people), the phrase \"You must be tired, because you've been running through my mind all day\" is apparently one of Europe's top ten chat-up lines.A mind doctorPressure, as everbody who reads the newspapers knows, is either mounting or growing, especially on ministers (government not religious). I have searched but can find no mention anywhere in the British press of pressure descending or dwindling. Indeed, I imagine the cabinet room to be rather like the Mariana Trench and its ministers to resemble the angler fish and flounders that haunt those remote and inhospitable depths. Geoff Hoon, I am reliably informed, is able to withstand pressures of up to 15,700 pounds per square inch, which would crush a normal human in an instant. It's something to do with being from Nottingham.The mechanism by which pressure mounts is almost always a thing called a ratchet, which is used as part of the phrasal verb \"to rachet up\". This strange process has been reported 620 times in the last week alone. Neither Barack Obama nor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad nor Rafael Benitez seems ever to leave home without his trusty ratchet. A ratchet is of course \"A mechanism consisting of a pawl that engages the sloping teeth of a wheel or bar, permitting motion in one direction only.\" It looks like this (the pawl is the bit at the top):The wheel can only turn anticlockwise. This device is the reason that pressure only ever mounts and grows: the pawl is stopping it from declining. This is bad news for Geoff Hoon. It's odd that journalists' imaginations should always leap to this reasonably obscure mechanism, I assume that they're all terribly keen on DIY. Many other things can be ratcheted up including sanctions, salaries and capital buffers (the people who polish London).A capital buffer working on Nelson's Column"},

For years I misheard the words and believed that she was singing: R, E, S, P, E, C, T.Take out the T, C, P.So I would remove the letters T, C and P from RESPECT and be left with rese, which means tremble as anybody familiar with Chaucer's description of the temple of Mars in The Knight's Tale knows:And therout came a rage and suche a veze,That it made al the gate for to rese.This seemed appropriate as Miss Franklin's supposed paramour, who has previously been enjoined merely to \"respect\" her, is now at the song's climax being asked to go further and to \"rese\" or tremble before her: a megalomaniac yearning to which the maenads respond with the incantation, \"sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me\" etc..The only other explanation was that Miss Franklin was asking for TCP the well known brand of antiseptic, whose name is a shortening of trichlorophenylmethyliodosalicyl. Perhaps, I thought, she yearns to heal the metaphorical (or even literal) wounds inflicted upon her by her respectless beau by cleaning them with this literal and emotional disinfectant.There was even the intriguing interpretation that Miss Franklin was demonstrating that respect could be cabalistically deconstructed into its two orthographical components of trembling and antiseptic.Then in one damascene moment I heard that it was not P but B. Take out the TCB. TCB is an initialism for Taking Care of Business. This phrase, nearly unknown on our shores, was used as a catch-all excuse by the tardy American male of the mid twentieth century. As in:Female: Why were you out until three in the morning?Male: TCB, baby, TCB.Miss Franklin is asking, therefore, that her lover cease to use this nebulous excuse; and therefore, by implication, she is entreating him to give up all those sins and divagations that would make such an excuse necessary.

{"title": "Pejoratives", "date": "Friday 27 November 2009", "text": "Years ago, at university, a friend of mine asked me what the pejorative of Greek was. I asked him what he meant and he said that the French were Frogs, the Italians Wops, the Germans Krauts, the Spanish Dagos and he wanted to know what the Greeks were. We couldn't work it out but we had fun trying. We had a good sense of hummus.Just so you know, here are the etymologies of the major European pejoratives:Frog Short for frog-eater (1798). Previously (1652) the pejorative for Dutchman because Holland is so marshy.Kraut From the German for cabbage. First recorded in 1841, but popularised during the First World War.Hun meant destroyer of beauty in 1806, long before it became the pejorative for German. That's because the Huns like the Vandals were a tribe who helped to bring down the Roman Empire (the actual order was Vandal, Goth, Hun pushing each other from Germany through France to Spain and North Africa). Matthew Arnold called art-haters Philistines on the same basis of naming people you don't like after an ancient tribe. It was Kaiser Wilhelm II who first applied it to Germans in 1900 when he urged the army he was sending to China to mimic the behaviour of their supposed Hunnish forbears and \"Take no prisoners\", a phrase that is usually attributed to him, although someone had doubtless said something like it before (\"I'll be back\" is similarly attributed to the film Terminator). The word was taken up as a pejorative during the World Wars as, though the Germans imagined their ancestors to be raffish and rugged, we thought them beastly.Wop (1912) American term, from Neapolitan dialect guappo meaning dandy or gigolo.Dago (1823) From Diego (obviously). Originally for either Spanish or Portuguese sailors.Spic (1913) American term for anyone in the slightest bit Hispanic. Derives from \"No speak English\". Or maybe from spaghetti via spiggoty (1910).Yank is far more complicated, which is why I'm sticking to Europeans. A rundown can be found here.I, meanwhile, am a Limey (contra scurvy), Beefsteak (contra cows), Pommy ((?) rhyming slang pomegranate=immigrant or maybe Prisoner Of Her Majesty(?)), Sassenach or Sasnaes (Scots and Welsh terms for Saxon), depending on which of my detractors you ask. I believe in Kenya I may be a mzungu, but that's only because in dictionaries mzungu is always the last word listed under M.

{"title": "Ikhthusphretophobia", "date": "Thursday 26 November 2009", "text": "Last night I was joyriding on the Docklands Light Railway. I made my way through the computer-controlled monorail, car by car, cruising for sentient beings, when I happened upon a copy of The Sun, which is indubitably the best-written newspaper in England. It had the words SLAMMED and BLASTED in two different headlines of a single page, which made me dance with delight. Moreover, The Sun was, I would wager, the only one of yesterday's papers to use the word ikhthusphretophobia, which apparently means \"an irrational fear of aquariums\". Ikhthusphretophobia popped up in a heart-cockle-warming story about a chap called Toby Davies, 21, (in The Sun your age is part of your name) who had conquered his phobia of fish tanks so that he could keep his job at the London Aquarium. Ikhthusphretophobia doesn't show up on Google. Not once. This made me a mite suspicious, but there's always the possibility of variant spellings in the transliteration from the Greek: the study of fish is usually spelled ichtyology with a ch. I was googling around and found lots of people who were frightened of aquariums including several who want to give a name to their phobia. One fellow said he was worried that the fish would leap out of the tank and he would tread on them. Also floating around the internet is the utterly unsubstatiated assertion that 73% of test-tube babies suffer from ikhthusphretophobia. I want that to be true. I demand that that be true.Ikhthusphretophobics contemplating a goldfishP.S. Any ikhthusphretophobic readers out there will be happy to know that Toby Davies, 21, was cured after only four hours of therapy.Today I read a review describing a film as \"deceptively lightweight\". What, I wondered, did this mean? Did the reviewer think the film seems deep on the surface (surely an oxymoron), but was essentially frivolous? Or did he mean that it is in fact serious, only appearing lightweight?This is the problem with the word \"deceptively\" - nobody can agree what it means when used to modify an adjective in this way. The OED definition of \"in a deceptive manner, so as to deceive\" is not very helpful, while the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (cited here at FreeDictionary.com) notes that \"when deceptively is used to modify an adjective, the meaning is often unclear\" - when its Usage Panel was asked to decide what a \"deceptively shallow pool\" meant, 50 percent thought the pool shallower than it appears, 32 percent thought it deeper than it appears, and 18 percent said it was impossible to judge.Deceptively simpleThe potential for ambiguity does not seem to have stopped people using it, particularly in arts reviews, sports commentary and property advertising. With some common phrases, it is fairly easy to grasp the general meaning. When a book, film, piece of music or other work of art is described as \"deceptively simple\", this generally means that it appears simple in a way that deceives the reader/viewer/listener about its essential complexity or cleverness. When applied to a recipe, however, as in Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall's \"deceptively simple\" blue cheese gougères, \"deceptively simple\" seems to mean the opposite: something which looks impressive or complicated, but is really very easy to prepare. And The Independent's description of Muse's debut album as \"deceptively sophisticated\" - which one might imagine to mean the reverse of \"deceptively simple\" - in fact suggests very much the same thing: that the album's superficial simplicity disguises an underlying sophistication.Other meanings are harder to pin down. The estate agent's favourite, \"deceptively spacious\" - does it mean a property which looks small from the street, or from photos, but is actually very large? Or does it - as Dogberry thinks - mean a property which is rather small, but gives the impression of being spacious through use of light and clever decorating? Either way, it means a property whose spaciousness is compromised in some way - not very desirable, but perhaps intriguing enough to persuade a buyer to set up a viewing.Deceptively spaciousAnd some usages are simply baffling. What does The Times's description of a cricketer's bowling as \"deceptively effective\" mean? That it was more effective than it looked? Or that it was effective because of its deceptiveness? Similarly, I quite can't work out what the \"deceptive\" is referring to in The Independent's description of \"deceptively well-crafted poems\" or The Times's of \"deceptively well-made\" short films, although I suspect the meaning in both cases is something close to \"deceptively simple\". The most marvellously mysterious, though, was the reference in a Times music review to Deep Purple's \"deceptively funky cymbals\". It is clear from the context that this is a good thing, but beyond that the meaning is entirely lost on me.It seems that the advantages of versatility and conciseness (it's quicker and neater to say \"deceptively shallow\" than \"shallower than it appeared\") overrule any concerns about confusing the reader. \"Deceptively\" also allows the writer to lay claim to a degree of perspicacity in discerning what is not immediately apparent; this may also be part of its appeal.Deceptively funky4A5956UJG8GWS2X5SYZXE67M"},
{"title": "Checkmate", "date": "Wednesday 25 November 2009", "text": "According to the Guardian the boxing promoter Don King manages a fighter known as Kali \"Checkmate\" Meehan. Checkmate comes from the Persian Shah mat meaning King is dead. I am sure Mr King, who is a keen etymologist, delights in the suicidal connotations of his pugilist's nickname. Incidentally, a nickname is a metanalysis from an ekename meaning an extra name, in the same way that an apron was originally a napron.Someday I shall do a long and extraordinarily dull post on every word that derives from chess (even cheque does).A keen etymologistDOMESTIC VIOLENCE LESSONS PLANNED   - According to the BBCI remember the time I applied for the post of \"Hate Crimes Coordinator\" for Hackney Council. I thought I had that job sewn up. There are a lot of hate crimes coordinators out there, from Wigan to Los Angeles.Well done, Jenkins! You're making progress.Following my earlier post, I started thinking about the various meanings of the word \"distressed\".The most topical cluster of meanings seems to be the financial ones: applied to companies, \"experiencing financial difficulty or near bankruptcy\", applied to assets, \"offered for sale at a low price due to liquidation, insolvency, or foreclosure\". I had a vague idea that phrases like \"distressed assets\" and \"distressed debt\" stemmed from the 1980s junk bond era, so was surprised to find the word used in both these senses as long ago as the nineteenth century, in contexts that would not look too out of place in today's financial press. The Times in 1866 reported on tightening credit conditions, writing that the \"leading banks..vehemently shut out even the smallest applications of any of the distressed companies for momentary assistance\".  The OED cites an 1899 article from The Chicago Tribune which commented (apparently in reference to some early bailout or aid for speculators fallen on hard times): \"If the relief of distressed stock gamblers alone were contemplated nobody outside of Wall street [sic] would defend the proposition\".A comparatively modern usage is the fashion/design one - as in \"distressed denim\" or \"distressed furniture\". But again, it's not as modern as I assumed - the OED shows that it was in use as early as 1940 to refer to reproduction furniture made to look antique through \"simulated marks of age and wear\".One sense which does not feel very current is the OED's note that the primary definition of \"afflicted with pain or trouble\" applies specifically to people living in reduced circumstances. This nuance seems to be disappearing - to refer to \"distressed gentlefolk\", or people living \"in distressed circumstances\" now has a quaint, old-fashioned air, evocative of Victorian philanthropy. Dogberry tells me that there is a sign on Greek Street in London (not London's Greek Street) offering aid to \"ladies in distress\", but I have never been able to find it.A damsel in distress"},

I'll only brush off or dismiss them.'Some dictionaries tell me that the word doesn't exist in America, or that over there it means fit well with, which is odd as the New York Daily News used it the other day.

However, it's the only place in Britain with an exclamation mark in the name. This is because the town was built from scratch in 1865 as a resort that would feed off the popularity of Charles Kingsley's novel Westward Ho!. The town was a marketing tie-in.Kingsley's novel derived its name from the renaissance play Westward Ho! by Thomas Webster and John Dekker about a group of people who take a trip up the Thames to Brentford. The title came from the Thames boatmen who were going upstream who would shout \"Westward Ho!\"So Westward Ho! being in the West of England is pretty much a coincidence. There's also a town in Canada that is called Saint-Louis-du-Ha!-Ha!, but nobody seems to know why.Exclamation marks are so rare in formal writing that many of the style guides simply ignore them like the drunk at a wedding reception. The Economist and Gowers' Plain Words fall into this camp (if you can fall into a camp) while The Times and The Guardian limit themselves to the three words: \"nearly always unnecessary\" and \"do not use\". Fowler starts by arguing that !s must be used for exclamatory statements such as What a pity! or How dull! and wishes proper such as May the force be with you! This does not work for a normal reader. Alec Guinness did not speak with an exclamation mark in his voice and the main purpose of punctuation is to denote what voice the sentence should be read in. Indeed, this is not simply a purpose but an inevitable outcome of punctuation. Fowler vaguely concedes this point but then reels off a list of varied emotions and varied voices. To be fair to Fowler, punctuation and voice change more with fashion than most matters verbal, so I shall leave him be.Instead, I shall go with Bryson who says that exclamation marks should be used to display \"strong emotion or urgency\" and nothing else. They mean that the voice should be raised. Eureka! The roadsigns that say STOP! are correct. The swooning women who cry \"Oh God!\" are correct. The Fun Facts columns that say \"A cheetah can run at 75mph!\" are wrong, unless you go around shouting at people about cheetahs, which I confess I sometimes do.The crime against humanity, though, is the exclamation mark used to designate a joke. I took the main road out of town, but the police made me put it back!!! is a capital offence and if you ever do it I will hunt you down like a dog (I hunt dogs) and then do foul things to your corpse.Worst, though, is an exclamation mark used to indicate a joke that isn't a joke. This is a variation of the person who exclaims, \"I'm always losing my car keys,' and then laughs as though they had said something funny. Such people look at me hoping that I will laugh too, but I do not. I do not. I return their glance with a still, acidic gaze and reach for my set of recreational scalpels. If this is replicated in print I get properly angry. I once received a wedding invitation that said that you could drive to the ceremony \"if you can find a place to park!!!!!\"Five exclamation marks.And then, when the church was set ablaze during the service with the doors locked from the outside, the police had the temerity to call my crime \"motiveless\".Serves them right!!!!!"},

Perhaps he had black teeth, nobody is quite sure as the meaning of blau has changed over the years. His other great achievement was to unite the warring provinces of Denmark and Norway under a single king (himself).Jim Kardach developed a system in 1996 that would allow mobile telephones to communicate with computers thus uniting two independent areas of technology. Whilst working on the project he read The Longships by Frans Gunnar Bengtsson (which I read when I was twelve and remember to be rather good). The novel is set in the time of Harald Bluetooth. Jim Kardach felt he was uniting warring provinces of technology so he named the project Bluetooth. It was never meant to be the actual name on the marketing: blue teeth are not a pleasant image. But the name that was meant to be used - Pan - was already taken. So bluetooth it was and bluetooth it ever shall be. You can read a full account of the naming process here. I was reminded of all this indirectly by a friend who mentioned how much he liked the old-fashioned phrase hat-tip which is used by bloggers to give credit to a source. He was reminded of it by a hat-tip that I put up the other day and e-mailed me to say that \"In my mind, the tipped hat is always a trilby.\"It set me wondering when hats started to be tipped in the blogosphere. I can't work it out with any accuracy but here's a graph that I managed with Google on the use of the phrase in the news over the last ten years.The last month without a single hat-tip appears to have been February 2004, so I imagine that the phrase must have come into common usage some time over the next few months.There's something lovely about the antiquity of these phrases, rather like the old-fashioned freelance to describe somebody who will work for anyone.An original marketing slide for Bluetooth technology incorporating a (slightly altered) runestone image of Harald Bluetooth."},

{"title": "Sad Pathetic Mean Killer", "date": "Thursday 19 November 2009", "text": "A friend of mine once pointed out to me that there is something wrong with a society where pathetic and sad are both terms of abuse. This was back in the nineties and we were schoolboys so anything we disliked was sad and anybody we disliked was a sadcase. I remembered this yesterday when I happened to hear Pinball Wizard by The Who. The chorus, if you can call it that, goes \"That deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball\", meaning that he's very good at pinball. \"He makes a mean lasagne\", means that the lasagne is good. It made me wonder what the word mean means in this context. It can't mean miserly and it can't mean lowly so mean must mean malevolent, but in a good way.This in turn reminded me of when I worked briefly as a researcher for a headhunting firm. They had a database of all the candidates they had ever interviewed. It was divided into four categories: bad, ok, good and killer. Killer was the best. I mentioned this to the CEO and he told me that the company always used the language of the ghetto (which would, technically, be Venetian). There's also a thing much talked of at the moment called a Killer App which, according to Wikipedia, is a \"computer program that is so necessary or desirable that it proves the core value of some larger technology\". App means computer program. So killer must mean \"so necessary or desirable that it proves the core value\". Does that seem odd to you?According to the Online Etymology Dictionary pathetic was first used to mean \"so miserable as to be ridiculous\" in 1937 and sad began to be \"inferior\" in 1899. Meanwhile, mean began to mean good in about 1900 and killer first meant good in 1937. So all the semantic shifts I had put together happened within 38 years of each other.Significantly, I can't think of any equivalent in French. Pathetique still means moving and triste still means unhappy. I might investigate some other languages, but this post is getting too long.Now, there's a well known aspect of slang, especially children's slang, that words can shift meaning to become their opposites. At my school yoi meant no and noi meant yes. That's why good things used to be wicked and are now sick. There's also a common etymological observation that many words once meant themselves and their opposites. That's why when you withhold something you don't hold it in common and when you withdraw you do it on your own. It's preserved in the two meanings of cleave: to split in two or to cling together. But I don't think that either of those principles can apply here. There is no jocular sense to killer. We simply feel that malice is better than suffering and our words follow.Necessary and desirable, apparently."},

{"title": "Novels of Misspelling", "date": "Wednesday 18 November 2009", "text": "Gentle reader, I should warn you that there may be some coarse language in this post. In fact, I'm sure there will be. The first line of the deliciously delicate novel Londonstani goes like this:Serve him right he got his muthafuckin face fuck’d, shudn’t b callin me a Paki, innit.You see, what the author is doing, which is very clever, is to tell us the accent in which the character is speaking. That’s why he spells mother as mutha. That’s how they pronounce it in Hounslow.Etonians, Oxonians and indeed all those who don’t live in Hounslow pronounce mother as mow-thear. We also pronounce the e in fucked, which we write as fuckèd. A typical conversation at my boarding school would run something like this:- Is your mow-thear coming to visit you this weekend?- I’m afraid not; she’s too busy being fuckèd by my faither.- Noi.That’s how it was. As for the b – well I’m not going to tell you how we pronounce b because then you would be able to move among us undetected and it would be worse than the worst excesses of the French revolution.What really gets my goat about all this, though, is that he spells right with a ght. I can only deduce from this that the ght is always pronounced in full around the farther reaches of the Piccadilly Line.In the pubs near me (North West London, far from Hounslow) people employ a strange rhetorical device whereby a noun is immediately followed by a superfluous pronoun. The conversations are hard to punctuate but they go something like this:Mike, he reckons that Arsenal, they’re going to win the league this year. Me, I reckon that Chelsea, they’ve got the strength and depth for a long and bitter campaign.That really is how they speak, like the bits of newspaper at the bottom of an old lady's drawer. Yet the funny thing in the gritty novels of misspelling like Londonstani is that after throwing in a bunch of oaths and curses the author almost always forgets to do anything so extended as to make a line of dialogue sound structurally convincing.In Carl Hiaasen’s novel Skinny Dip, which is set in Florida, one word is misspelled throughout. Son of bitch is consistently rendered sumbitch, which is perfect because that is how they pronounce it in the Profound South. The word only pops up every ten pages or so, but that one eccentricity of spelling combines with Hiaasen’s excellent ear for the structures of speech to keep the accent in the reader’s mind.But those writers who misspell more than once a page are almost always cloth-eared when it comes to patterns of speech.The only exception I can think of to this rule is Dickens who, of course, rendered speech perfectly but still made poor people reveal their lack of education by saying woz instead of was.It shouldn’t really be me writing this post. Mrs Malaprop – a former Miss Hounslow finalist with relations in Florida – could have knocked it together better than I have done, but I fear the swearing would have made her take fright, which she would pronounce friggahut.Sir John Suckling from HounslowUPDATE: Mrs Malaprop informs me that nobody in Hounslow would ever pronounce the t in innit.Apparently, Hillary Clinton has said that David Miliband is attractive and \"vibrant\".I have posted on this word before, and now I'm off, weeping, to the fishmonger.It also occurs to me that Hillary has one L too many and Miliband one too few.

Well, I didn't believe this claim at all (there's a pseudo-apocryphal urban myth about a computerised translation system that rendered out of sight, out of mind as blind mad) so I decided to test it by trying the definitions of some of my favourite words.

Nothing! I'm not sure what the picture would have looked like, but I'd like to have seen it nonetheless.Instead, I'll tell you that there was a cult in classical Syracause dedicated to Aphrodite Kallipygos, or Venus of the Beautiful Bottom. At least, there may have been. All we know about it comes from an ancient Greek chap called Alciphron, who spent his time composing imaginary letters.The Greeks carved statues of the goddess making her as callipygian as they possibly could. It was far too much for one young man, but to find out about him you'll have to follow this link to Lucian's Venus of Knidos and read paragraphs fifteen and sixteen. I promise you that it's terribly, terribly funny.An immodest deityP.S. For the latter half of this post I was using my copy of Nigel Spivey's Understanding Greek Sculpture, which is awfully good.P.P.S. I knew about callipygian before, though, as it pops up in Aldous Huxley's Antic Hay, which is probably my favourite novel.Almost everybody knows that it is wrong to use apostrophes before an ‘s’ which denotes a plural rather than a possessive. So it is “breakfasts” and “tomatoes”, not “breakfast’s” (which I saw on a sign yesterday) or “tomato’s”. But what about plurals of words made up of initial letters, like “GCSE” or “CEO”? (Incidentally, these should – strictly speaking – be referred to as initialisms, rather than acronyms – see explanation below)*. Does the same rule still apply? I think it does, but perhaps not so strongly. A reference to “CD’s” or “MP’s” may not stand out so clearly as being wrong as “tomato’s”, but the apostrophe is still unnecessary – the lower case “s” is on its own enough to denote the plural. The Economist’s online style guide, in its section on acronyms, recommends using a regular lower-case “s”, with no apostrophe in sight. The same – and here The Economist is explicit – holds true for decades, so it is “the 1990s”, not “the 1990’s”. Things get a little more complicated when it comes to plurals of single letters. Here the authorities do not agree. The Times style guide advises that “an apostrophe should be used to indicate the plural of single letters - p's and q's”**. This is presumably to avoid confusion with two-letter words (or initialisms) ending in \"s\", like \"ps\", \"as\" or \"is\",But, although a recent Sunday Times feature followed this format, a Times column earlier this month referred to “Ps and Qs”. A similar discrepancy can be found between a recent article from the Daily Mail (“Ps and Qs”) and one from its sister paper, the Mail on Sunday (“p’s and q’s”). This suggests that with plurals of single letters, either format will do – upper case letters with no apostrophe, or lower case letters with an apostrophe. * An acronym is made up of initials, or first syllables, of other words, and is pronounced as if it were a word – like NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) or Unicef (United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund). With an initialism like CD, MP, GCSE or CEO, each of the initials is pronounced separately.** The etymology of this phrase, which means “to be careful or particular in one's words or behaviour; to mind one's manners”, is mysterious; The Phrase Finder discusses it at some length. Some people think it stems from advice to apprentice typesetters or children learning to write (not muddling up two similar-looking letters), but it has also been suggested that it comes from “pints and quarts” or “pleases and thank-yous”.(Picture from a Walk in the WoRds)REVEALED: THE NIGHT DAVID CAMERON BLOCKED TAKE THAT'S REUNION WITH ROBBIE WILLIAMS   - The lovely Daily MailSomeday I shall see a newspaper page with the headline NOT REVEALED: and everything underneath will be blank.I shall doodle there.The article also says that the gig \"has been hotly anticipated\", a phrase that could only be used in the passive.Doodle-room"},
{"title": "Lovemaking, Actually", "date": "Monday 16 November 2009", "text": "When I was seven, a helpful children's librarian gave me a copy of Jane Austen's Emma to read. I think I must have looked older than I was, or perhaps the librarian believed in exposing children to the classics as early as possible. I must have disappointed her when I returned it half-read, explaining that it was very boring and that \"nothing happened except for people getting married\". I did, however, read far enough to reach the scene (a few pages into Chapter 15) when Emma finds herself in a carriage with Mr Elton \"actually making violent love to her\", a folly she attributes in part to \"drunkenness\". This being my first brush with nineteenth-century literature, I only knew that \"making love\" was something to do with where babies came from; the idea of it being \"violent\" or taking place in a carriage with somebody else's lover was quite alarming, and I was shocked at how lightly Emma seemed to take it, rebuking him in a \"polite\" and \"playful\" way.This is an example of a powerful new association making earlier usage bewildering or unintentionally amusing. The use of lovemaking in the sexual sense first appeared in the early twentieth century, but it has now so completely overshadowed the earlier meaning of \"wooing\" or \"courtship\" that using it in the original sense is almost impossible. Elizabeth and Mr Darcy: Making love, Austen-styleThere's a fascinating article in the future tense on the front page of today's Times. It begins:Gordon Brown will fire the starting gun this week for a general election campaign that could run for six months. He will outline a programme of populist measures in the Queen’s Speech and challenge David Cameron to support them. The Prime Minister is to emphasise his determination to carry on governing with a political programme designed to exploit Labour’s differences with the Conservatives on health, education and the economy. He will use Wednesday’s speech to reveal plans to provide free care at home for about 350,000 of the neediest people and to tear up “risky” bankers’ contractsIn the 1960s Michael Frayn tried to write a novel entirely in the future tense. It was called A Very Private Life and it began:Once upon a time there will be a little girl called Uncumber...But Michael Frayn, master of the English language, smasher of literary idols, couldn't keep it up. He just wasn't good enough. After a few pages he switched, defeated, into the present. The Times, though, is far better than that.Reading the article, one almost feels that Gordon Brown exists as nothing more than an excuse for the writer to display his virtuoso use of tenses; and if that is so, Gordon Brown should feel honoured. The lazy insouciance with which, after five paragraphs of Delphic futures, the article switches to the past tense in the first line of the sixth is as harsh yet hearty as Eric Pickles himself. Then in the seventh paragraph there is the dreamy sprezzatura with which we ease seamlessly into the present tense with three soothing participles in a single sentence.With Labour trailing heavily in the polls, Mr Brown is pinning his hopes on a long election campaign focusing on an expected economic recovery and public services.I challenge anybody to read the article and not be reminded of Coleridge's panchronological \"ancestral voices prophesying war\".Except The Times is better.Outwritten"},
{"title": "Bunking and Debunking", "date": "Sunday 15 November 2009", "text": "It is vital that you know that debunking has nothing to do with bunk beds. It's connected to bunk as a contraction of bunkum or rubbish. Bunkum, as any fule kno, derives from Buncombe County, North Carolina, whose representative in Congress made a particularly stupid speech in 1820 \"for Buncombe\". It was such an inane oration that the word bunkum, with a K, has now spread around the world. Buncombe, North Carolina, was named after Edward Buncombe who fell down stairs and died. Edward Buncombe must have been a descendant of Richard de Bounecombe of Somerset (1327), whose name meant \"dweller in the reed valley\" from the Anglo Saxon bune meaning reed and cumb or coomb meaning valley. Coomb relates to cwm in Welsh and is one of the very few words that the Anglo Saxons took from Celtic languages.The origin of bunk bed is unknown.All of which is utterly irrelevant to what this post was meant to be about.Michael Flanders once said, \"The purpose of satire, it has been rightly said, is to strip off the veneer of comforting illusion and cosy half-truth. And our job, as I see it, is to put it back again.\"So in the interests of continuing his good work:Kangaroo does not mean 'I don't understand' in aboriginal. This is a myth.Yucatan does not mean 'I don't understand' in Mayan. This too is a myth, a deliberate untruth spread by Cortes to discredit a province-naming rival. It means \"place of richness\" in nahuatl.However, before you tearfully decide that there is No Fun in etymology anymore, there is in Madagascar a kind of lemur known to science as the indri. Indri, in the native tongue, means Look at that!The reason, as you have no doubt already guessed (aren't you clever?), is that a naturalist called Pierre Sonnerat was wandering happily through the jungle naming things (like Adam) when his guide shouted \"Look at that!\" Out came the notebook and it has been the indri ever since.This is not, alas, a useful titbit of information for cocktail parties as nobody else will have heard of the indri. But it is useful to know that something from Madagascar is not Madagascan but Malagasy, just as something from Monaco is not Monacan or Monte Carlan but Monegasque. So it's the Monegasque Grand Prix.Look at that!This suggestive little phrase originally meant opening the books, or providing additional information about a company, to an outsider - typically a potential investor, employee, merger partner, acquirer. But it is also used as a metaphor for \"organisational openness and transparency\". According to the Microsoft Lexicon it is: \"A marvelous phrase of non-Microsoft origin, probably stemming from the rash of Japanese acquisitions of American enterprises in the ‘80s, that has been adopted into the Microspeak marketing lexicon. Basically a somewhat sexist synonym for \"open the books,\" it means to reveal the inner workings of a project or company to a prospective new partner\".Those who like to \"open the kimono\" praise it for its vividness, but - quite apart from the \"somewhat sexist\" connotations - it feels almost too vivid for use in business meetings. To me, at least, the image of kimono-swathed businessmen opening their robes and letting it all hang out - or alternatively, trying to get a peek under somebody else's kimono - is too distracting, too comical and too suggestive of striptease for such a serious setting. But after reading reports this week of a financier who attended overseas meeting accompanied by an escort in \"revealing hot pants and high heeled shoes\", I think I may have been underestimating the tolerance for burlesque in business."},

In my mind's eye I see a verdant and expansive kingdom ruled by a plump, benign queen. I don't know why Possibility should be female, but she is. And imagine what the border checkpoints are like!

Everet says it's all true, but he doesn't know why.As a little sequitur to Mrs Malaprop's splendid post about railway-speak on Thursday, the train I was on today suddenly stopped somewhere in Staffordshire. I assumed at first that the driver was a keen botanist who wanted to examine the hedgerow on our right hand side. It was a pretty hedgerow, blooming and blowing with all sorts of shrubs and bushes, and I wouldn't have blamed the driver for wanting to stop the train and have a closer look. Indeed, I was a trifle envious. But then his voice came from the loud-speakers telling us that the train was delayed - Imagine that! A British train delayed! - the delay, he told us in deep and masterful tones, was:Due to a road traffic accidentNot  because of a car-crash, but  due to a road traffic accident.Due, because it was clearly owing, the debt paid by reality to causality and collected with the violent assiduity of a starving mafioso. Road traffic because there's an awful lot of traffic off-road. Or perhaps because there's an awful lot of road accidents that don't involve traffic. I don't know.Anyway, we sat there for a while and after about forty minutes which I had passed by re-reading L'Innommable the fellow opposite me made a call on his mobile phone. (The Americans call it a cell phone, which has always put me in mind of a garrulous monk). 'Hello? Dave?' he said in a broad Cumbrian accent. He seemed, indeed, to be a broad, Cumbrian man. 'I've been delayed... What?.. There's a been a...'And I saw the flicker, the confusion, the slight linguistic tsunami pass across his face. It was the face of a man who has been hypnotised to kill his mother and, as he holds chisel above her sleeping head, is half remembering something, half knowing who he is, was and could be again. But he was too weak. TOO WEAK!'It's due to a road traffic accident,' he said like one of those hostages saying he's being treated well. 'Yes... a road traffic accident... I know it's a train but... listen, I won't be at Preston before five at the earliest.'It was like watching this:The UK Government’s Treasury Select Committee has recently conducted an enquiry into “Women in the City” (which, until I checked the Committee’s homepage, I was convinced was called “Sexism and the City”, in homage to the television series Sex and the City; I was rather disappointed to find out that this was not the case). The enquiry is part of a broader debate about equality and the role of women in business, which has seen much written about “gender diversity”, “gender-related differences” and “gender pay gaps”.One might have expected such language to be greeted with peevish letters from linguistic prescriptivists. Only a few years ago, this was still something that troubled newspaper readers, like the correspondent who ticked off the Guardian’s leader writers for confusing “the word sex (biology) with gender, a grammatical term for a linguistic oddity confined, I think, to Indo-European languages”; or the one who wrote to the Sunday Telegraph in 2003 citing Fowler’s edict that “gender is a grammatical term only”.But the complaints, unless there has simply been a collective decision not to publish them, seem to have stopped. This suggests that “gender” is now accepted as a synonym for “sex”, particularly in social or cultural (as opposed to biological) contexts. It may be because it is useful to be able to make this distinction. It may also be because “sex” has become so associated with the act of having sex that some people prefer “gender” as less smutty: in an article on the subject, Rutgers English professor Jack Lynch imagines the frustration of pollsters after “finding the \"Sex\" blank on a form filled in with \"Yes, please\" for the jillionth time”.“Gender” hasn’t edged out “sex” entirely – “sexism”, despite dating back less than a hundred years in its present sense, is firmly ensconced in the language, as are phrases like “sexual politics” and “single-sex school”. But in many other phrases, particularly newer ones or ones to do with feminism, “gender” may make more sense than “sex”. “Gender diversity” is much less ambiguous than “sexual diversity”, which is now almost always used to mean “diversity of sexual orientation”. And “sex studies” would mean something entirely different from “gender studies”. Although the Oxford English Dictionary suggests that “gender” is a “modern euphemism” for “sex”, it cites examples of the usage going back to the fourteenth century. In 1709, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (above) wrote that “of the fair sex… my only consolation for being of that gender has been the assurance it gave me of never being married to any one among them”, while an 1896 edition of the Daily News expressed the admirably enlightened opinion that “as to one's success in the work one does, surely that is not a question of gender”."},
{"title": "The Sartorial Singular", "date": "Friday 13 November 2009", "text": "I have just received an email inviting me to buy Christmas presents at Sweaty Betty, which for the uninitiated is a shop selling fashionable sports and fitness clothes for women - in some cases so beautifully designed that customers are inspired to take up certain sports simply for the opportunity to wear the clothes.One item in particular caught my eye: the \"unwind pant\". Pants, of course, is an American word for what the British call trousers. Although it is still considered an Americanism, it is gaining ground in Britain for terms referring to sportswear. \"Sweatpants\" is far more common than the unpleasant-sounding \"sweat trousers\". \"Jogging pants\" and \"tracksuit pants\", meanwhile, are used about half as frequently as \"jogging trousers\" and \"tracksuit trousers\" - although \"bottoms\", as in \"jogging bottoms\" and \"tracksuit bottoms\", remains the most popular word by a wide margin.But it was not the word \"pant\" in itself, nor the use of the verb \"unwind\" as an adjective which struck me - it was the use of the singular. I have never referred to a \"pant\" or a \"trouser\", any more than I would use \"a glass\" to mean a pair of spectacles - it is always \"pants\" or \"a pair of pants\". \"Pants\" is what is known as a plurale tantum - a word that only ever appears in the plural form - and \"pant\" is a bizarre and grammatically incorrect back-formation.However, the use of the fashion singular - identified here by the wonderful Hadley Freeman, although even she seems uncertain about the word \"pant\" - is becoming more and more common, mostly in marketing and advertising copy (as in the Gap advert above) but also in the words of designers themselves. We can probably expect to hear more about \"the pant\", \"the trouser\" and \"the legging\", although I hope that we will be spared \"the bottom\", at least in reference to sportswear.A week or so ago I surprised myself by using the word \"jean\" in the singular - something like \"that's a nice jean\", or \"I like a jean with a high waist\". Thus fashion-speak insinuates itself into everyday life.* Curiously, the only recent reference I have found to \"sweat trousers\" appears in a Financial Times fashion review).According to yesterday's Evening Standard (which was forced on me by a wild-eyed maiden in W.H. Smiths),Leona Lewis has paid tribute to the mean streets of Hackney, telling how her tough upbringing has prepared her to face anything.Quite aside from the military, Roman-Empirish connotations of paying tribute, I was pleased by the tenacity of “mean streets”.The phrase was invented by Raymond Chandler in his essay The Simple Art of Murder written in 1950:Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid. The detective must be a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man. He must be, to use a rather weathered phrase, a man of honor. It’s astonishing that such a simple tethering of a common adjective and common noun should have held on for so long, like one of those shotgun marriages that lasts to a golden anniversary. It has no official, legal or psychobabble patron like hard labour, deadly weapon or tough love. Yet, like bindweed, it lives.Chandler probably intended mean more with the sense of lowly or poor than with the purely malicious understanding that the word acquired with Martin Scorcese’s film.Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean...As a lovely point of trivia Raymond Chandler was educated at Dulwich College in London from 1900 to 1905 , just missing P.G. Wodehouse who was there from 1894 to 1900. They both excelled at classics: hence their impeccable grammar.Chandler’s views on split infinitives must be left to another post.The mean streets of Dulwich in 1890P.S. According to Microsoft Word, which is always underlining my Heliconian scribblings, the first sentence of this post should have read “which did a wild-eyed maiden in W.H. Smiths force on me”. I rather like it; it sounds like one of those pseudy-demotic ballads of the early nineteenth century."},
{"title": "Railways: On the platform edge", "date": "Thursday 12 November 2009", "text": "Railway-speak is a peculiar dialect, characterised by tortuous phrasing, a fondness for neologism, and a seeming reluctance to take responsibility for delays, unscheduled stops, failure to stop and indeed anything else that might go wrong. Announcers follow the principle that they should never use one word when two might do. Take, for example, the exhortation to “mind the gap between the train and the platform edge”. Why “platform edge”, and not simply “platform”? And, if you have to mention the edge, why do so in the odd phrase “platform edge” and not the far more natural-sounding “edge of the platform”?The strangeness of the construction becomes clear when you apply it to other phrases. The Carpenters were standing “on the top of the world”, not “the world top”. And in the words of Kenny Price, everyone likes to be at “the front of the bus, the back of the church… [and] the middle of the road” – not the “bus front”, the “church back” and the “road middle”. The rules governing the possessive and the use of noun combinations are incredibly complex, and there are exceptions – mountaintop, hilltop and table top sound natural, as do cliff edge and knife edge (although knife edge in particular seems more common as a metaphor). But, in general, possessives referring to a particular part or area of an object seem to use the “of” form (or, less frequently, “‘s”, as in “Land’s End”). Here is an interesting discussion about the possessive and noun + noun combinations. It makes a distinction between objects belonging to living things (which typically take “’s”) and objects or parts of non-living things, where the possessive is formed through by using “of” or through a noun + noun combination.The word elaphine means of or pertaining to a stag. Therefore, stag nights, stag parties, stag dos, stag drinks, stag weekends and all such hideousnesses could be rebranded elaphine nights, elaphine parties, elaphine dos, elaphine drinks and elaphine weekends.I feel this would somehow make them better. At least it would make them sound better, which is a start. Elaphine paintballing is such an unwieldy combination that people might notice that the activity just isn't any fun. If it were we would be doing it all the time. Elaphine derives, since you ask, from the Cervus Elaphus or red deer.An elaphine painting"},
{"title": "In Flanders Fields The Poppies Blow", "date": "Wednesday 11 November 2009", "text": "In Flanders fields the poppies blowI didn't realise for years that blow in this poem may actually mean bloom.  It's the second meaning of blow hidden in every dictionary.  In fact, Chambers puts it first:  blow v.i. to bloom or blossom.  Hence a 'full blown rose'.  The poppies may not be blowing in the breeze but blossoming and blooming.\"I know a bank where the wild thyme blows\" in A Midsummer Night's Dream is certainly about blooming and not bending in the breeze.Bloom is also definitely the meaning in Milton's Lycidas:As killing as the canker to the rose, Or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze, Or frost to flow'rs, that their gay wardrobe wear, When first the white-thorn blows; Such, Lycidas, thy loss to shepherd's ear. White-thorns blow in the windy sense all year round, but in the blossomy sense they blow in May or early June, after the frosts have stopped.Bending or blossoming? A young soldier, Cyril Allinson, who was there at the composition later reported that the poppies were being blown by a gentle east wind, but he also said that McCrae handed him the poem without saying a word. For myself, I think that a flower that blows must be assumed to be blooming, unless stated otherwise, especially in the mind of former English master like McCrae who must have been at least half aware of the echo of Shakespeare's wild thyme.Flanders Fields is the only great English example of a rondeau. As it is the anniversary of the end of the war, perhaps you should balance Flanders Fields with Siegfried Sassoon's account of the moment that peace was announced:Everyone suddenly burst out singing;And I was filled with such delightAs prisoned birds must find in freedom,Winging wildly across the whiteOrchards and dark-green fields; on—on—and out of sight.Everyone’s voice was suddenly lifted;And beauty came like the setting sun:My heart was shaken with tears; and horrorDrifted away … O, but EveryoneWas a bird; and the song was wordless; the singing will never be done.Update: flicking through a dictionary of quotations has given me these, putting blow as a poetic term for bloom up till 26 years before In Flanders Fields:The budding rose above the full blown...   -Wordsworth The Prelude, Book XI 1850Against the blown rose may they stop their noseThat kneel'd unto the buds   -Shakespeare Antony & Cleopatra II,vThe flower that once hath blown forever dies   -Edward Fitzgeral Omar Khayyam 1889To me the meanest flower that blows can giveThoughts that do often lie too deep for tears   -Wordsworth Intimations of ImmortalityI sometimes think that never blows so redThe rose as where some buried Caesar bled   -Fitzgerald Omar Khayyam 1889O fairest flower, no sooner blown but blasted,Soft silken primrose fading timelessly.   -John Milton On the Death of a Fair Infant, Dying of a Cough [It wasn't the cough/That carried him off/But the coffin/They carried him off in.]"},
{"title": "Terms of engagement", "date": "Tuesday 10 November 2009", "text": "Saturday's Times carried a letter in which some \"matrons in the Shires\" took issue with Giles Coren's references to his \"girlfriend\", when the pair had already announced their engagement. \"Esther is rather more than a \"girlfriend\" now,\" they chided, the inference being that her future husband ought to acknowledge her instead as his fiancée . Mr Coren's response was short and eloquent: \"Yes, but 'fiancée' is such a horrid word...\".The word \"fiancé(e)\" is one which evokes strong emotions, not all of them romantic. As long ago as 1949, the novelist Angela Thirkell wrote testily about \"the dreadful word fiancée...what we can do about it we really do not know\". What can we do about it? Some people, like the columnist above, avoid it altogether and refer to their girlfriend or boyfriend as just that until they are married. Some accommodate it through feats of mispronunciation - like my colleague who pronounces it to rhyme with séance - while others reach for the thesaurus and dust off alternatives such as betrothed or intended. What puzzles me is why it causes such awkwardness. I have seen it accused of being pretentious and of sounding like a \"middle manager at a high street bank\". But the most probable explanation is that, as a French loan word which has not been anglicised* in any way, it sounds strained and unnatural in English. It may also carry a whiff of genteelism, if the example of other French borrowings like \"serviette\" is anything to go by.* One of the posters here refers to her father, who in \"inimitable West Virginia fashion\" pronounced the word as “fi-ancy” (\"fi\" as in hi-fi).

{"title": "Just deserts", "date": "Monday 9 November 2009", "text": "An email in which my friend described the delicious praline he had enjoyed for desert reminded me of how commonly these two words - desert and dessert - are confused, most frequently in the phrase \"just deserts\" (and it is \"deserts\", not \"desserts\", despite what Dogberry thinks).It is remarkable how often people get this wrong. Over the last year, there have been 90 references in British newspapers to \"just deserts\" but 53 to \"just desserts\". Stripping out the inevitable puns in restaurant reviews, recipe pages, and an intriguing report about a local council which insisted that Spotted Dick be renamed Spotted Richard, we are still left with more than 20 instances of incorrect usage.This does not seem to be a simple case of misspelling, rather a widespread assumption that the phrase is some sort of food metaphor, like \"revenge is a dish best served cold\", or \"taste of one's own medicine\" (I know, medicine isn't food, precisely, but you get the picture). This is compounded by the confusing fact that \"desert\" is in this case pronounced like \"dessert\" and not like the sandy sort of desert.In fact, the \"desert\" in \"just deserts\" has nothing to do with sand or pudding, but comes from the Old French deservir and means something which is deserved, \"a due reward or recompense\". In England, at least, the word \"dessert\" also raises questions of class. There is a lingering sense that \"pudding\" is somehow socially preferable, which I think may be something to do with Nancy Mitford.I was just listening to The World at One. The main story was that Gordon Brown had made what he called an \"unintended mistake\". This gladdened me as it would have been odd if he had made an intended mistake. I'm not sure that a mistake can even theoretically be intended, unless it's a cartographer's folly.My word! I was just googling for a link to explain what a cartographer's folly is and could find almost nothing. So here goes. Maps are very easy to plagiarise. Rather than going out with theodolyte and measuring rod you can just reprint the Ordinance Survey map and claim it as your own. If the OS try and sue, you just pretend that you really mapped the area and that your map is identical to theirs because it is of precisely the same place. To stop such skullduggery, in every map you see published there will always be one small, deliberate error. It will be so tiny that it could never harm an orienteer but it will be there like the slight assymetry in a Persian rug and it will be enough for the original cartographer to be able to identify his work and sue.I have often wondered, spending as much time as I do sniffing dictionaries, whether there is such a thing as a lexicographer's folly.Ever so subtleThere's a story in The Times today about how a chap called Ben Shephard has accused Andrew Motion of plagiarism. Motion's defence is that other people have done it and he cites Shakespeare.Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra borrowed whole passages from Sir Thomas North’s Life of Mark Antony he said, including the description of her barge: “The poop was beaten gold; purple the sails . . .” The Times doesn't actually make clear whether this is Motion speaking in free indirect discourse or the journalist's interpolation, but it gave me a nasty turn. I dashed for my edition of Antony & Cleopatra (luckily I keep a copy of North's Plutarch strapped to my ankle for just such emergencies as these) and I compared passages. Here is the full sentence from North:She disdained to set forward otherwise, but to take her barge in the river of Cydnus, the poope whereof was of gold, the sailes of purple, and the owers of silver, which kept stroke in rowing after the sounde of the musicke of flutes, howboyes, citherns, violls, and such other instruments as they played upon in the barge. And here (if you need it) is Shakespeare:The barge she sat in, like a burnished throne,Burned on the water: the poop was beaten gold;Purple the sails, and so perfumèd, thatThe winds were lovesick with them; the oars were silver,Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and madeThe water which they beat to follow faster,As amorous of their strokes. Now correct me if I'm wrong (which I never am), but a few scattered words do not a \"whole passage\" make. It's not even a whole damned sentence. Moreover, those insidious dot dot dots suggest that there's more, whereas in fact Shakespeare now interpolates perfumes for the lovely alliteration of Ps.My New Cambridge Shakespeare (I can't find my Arden) says that \"the verbal parallels are remarkably close\", but nothing of whole passages copied word for word.Motion might just as well have cited Prospero's speech in The Tempest:Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and grovesAs against Golding's Metamorphoses (which flicks out from my left wrist like that gun in Taxi Driver):Ye elves of hills, of brooks, of woodsOf standing lakes, But neither of these comes close to T.S. Eliot's Journey of the Magi:A cold coming we had of it, Just the worst time of the yearFor a journey, and such a long journey:The ways deep and the weather sharpWhen compared to Lancelot Andrewes Christmas Day sermon of 1622:A cold coming they had of it at this time of the year, just the worst time of the year to take a journey, and specially a long journey. The ways deep, the weather sharpThis is a trifle more important because not only is it a whole quatrain taken pretty much word for word, but \"A cold coming we had of it\" is one of Eliot's most famous lines. Not the most famous, perhaps, but it's a contender alongside lines like: In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo. Which of course has nothing whatsoever to do with Jules Laforgue's   Dans la piece les femmes vont et viennent En parlant des maîtres de Sienne.   [In the room the women come and go Talking of the Siennese masters]Going through the Motions"},
{"title": "Vast Majority", "date": "Sunday 8 November 2009", "text": "I've found it! For years I've wondered how much a vast majority was. 51%? 99%? But this, found in the Mail, has, after all my lonely ponderings, given me the answer:The Premier League poppy group gained three more members on Tuesday when Fulham, Aston Villa and Portsmouth joined the vast majority of top-flight clubs who are now embroidering a poppy on their matchday shirts to mark Remembrance Sunday.This leaves just five clubs who won’t be displaying a poppy: Manchester United, Liverpool, Stoke, Blackburn and Bolton. Twenty teams in the Premier League, so it's 75%! Precisely three quarters! The great question is solved.Once, when I was young and foolish, I thought that it was just a meaningless phrase for journalists who didn't know any figures. Then I discovered how much the Economist uses the words - 560 times on their website - and so I knew, knew beyond doubt, that there must be a precise value to vastness.That or the Mail is better with numbers and raw information than the Economist is.A typical day in The Economist's newsroomPossible correction: I've just realised that before Fulham, Aston Villa and Portsmouth joined, there would only have been twelve out of twenty. So it's 60% unless the vast majority has only been achieved now that the other clubs have joined.“It all started when I served a smoked salmon pâté starter with Aquavit, a Scandinavian alcoholic drink made from caraway seeds. You drink it in one go, like a shot, and I thought it would compliment the starter and make my dinner a real social event”.(Countryfile star Julia Bradbury explaining how she fell out with Edwina Currie, Daily Mail Weekend supplement, 7 November 2009)Other than the decision to serve Aquavit to Edwina Currie, can anyone spot the mistake here? It is, of course, the use of the word “compliment” to mean “complement”.Complement has the sense of perfecting, completing or enhancing something, of going well with something or “setting it off”. Complementary colours (and flavours) enhance each other; complementary therapies are so called because they are used alongside, and complement, mainstream medical treatments.Compliment, as everyone knows, means “to pay a compliment to; to flatter with polite and delicate praise”. A guest could compliment the starter (or more correctly, perhaps, compliment the cook on the starter), but it would be very odd for an aperitif to do so. Complimentary can also have the sense of something which is given away for free, as a courtesy. If a restaurant were to offer a free shot of Aquavit to every customer, it could quite correctly be described as “complimentary”."},

{"title": "What the Dickens?", "date": "Friday 6 November 2009", "text": "The only reason T.S. Eliot insisted on his middle initial was that he was morbidly aware of what his name would have spelled backwards without it. Auden (whose H was idiopathic) wrote a palindrome on the subject:T. Eliot, top bard, notes putrid tang emanating, is sad. I'd assign it a name: gnat dirt upset on drab pot-toilet.S was a real name, though, it stood (appropriately) for Stearns, a name by which he briefly tried to be known as a student: i.e. T. Stearns Eliot. This is, incidentally, the reason that it's the Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock. The debilitating fear of the cloacal also produced, through inversion, the completely superfluous reference to the Turdus aonalaschkae pallasii, in the author's notes on The Waste Land.Meanwhile the phrase What the Dickens has nothing whatsoever to do with Charles Dickens (unless Shakespeare was blessed with the gift of prognostication). It pops up in The Merry Wives of Windsor and is derived (like almost every other renaissance expletive) from Devil.Just a little follow-up to my post on the grammar of Dickens and Eliot.The original DickensThe question of how to end a business letter, or indeed any letter, has always troubled me. When I started work, the letter had already ceded supremacy to the email and the fax was on its way to extinction (we still have a fax in the corner of the office, which hums away and occasionally spurts out flyers for new printer cartridges or similarly exciting merchandise, but nobody knows how to use it).At the same time, the structures and strictures of business correspondence seem to be dissolving. No longer is a “Dear Mr” invariably followed by “Yours sincerely”, or a “Dear Sir” by “Yours faithfully”. “Hi there”, “Hi everyone” and “Hello ladies” now seem to be perfectly acceptable ways to begin an email to clients or colleagues, as is the brusque vocative (“John, further to our conversation this morning…”).But it is the valediction where things really get sticky. However I end a business letter, I am always left feeling that there must have been some other, more elegant, friendly yet businesslike, way to conclude. Below are some of the most common.Best – Efficient and breezy, but to some minds, uncaring and abrupt.Best regards – I rather like “best regards”. The upbeat adjective “best” peps up the formal “regards”, and the combination of the two words is much less brusque than either on its own. It is the sign-off I end up using most often, but it is still very far from perfect. Kind regards – Dull and safe.Nothing – Not the word “nothing”, of course, but an email without any sort of sign-off at all, just a name (or even an initial with a full stop after it). This suggests that the sender is very busy and important, or alternatively cross about something. Short emails full of misspellings and contractions such as “u” for “you” are also intended to convey that someone is in a great hurry and has no time for trifles such as spelling and grammar.Regards – Formal and businesslike, but somehow slightly chilly. Warm regards – I have an instinctive aversion to this; the warmth somehow suggests physical contact and it reminds me of a handshake in which you find your hand clasped between two large, soft and insistent paws. But this is perhaps illogical.Yours ever – A smooth and slippery sign-off, charming but ultimately meaningless (particularly in business letters). Apparently Tony Blair used it when writing to colleagues.Yours sincerely – This seems to have fallen out of favour, as does “Yours faithfully”. When I was at school, letters to someone whose name you knew invariably ended “Yours sincerely”, while those to someone you didn’t know ended “Yours faithfully”. But I can’t remember the last time I received an email or a letter signed like this.Yours etc. – Does anyone actually sign letters like this, or is it merely a form of shorthand used by authors like Jane Austen to denote a longer and more elaborate valediction? Julian Barnes, in Talking it Over, suggests that signing letters “Yours etc.” or “Yours &c.” is the “true sign of the Old Bastard”, something a “bespatted captain of industry” might use when writing to The Times (for this I am indebted to jackburton-ga who reproduces the extract from Barnes’s novel in full on Google Answers).Yours (something else) – There are lots of variants on the “yours” theme. Dogberry used to send me letters signed with a flourish such as “Yours democratically” or “Yours free in a packet of cornflakes”, but this has lapsed in recent years. Update: Here is an interesting article from the New York Times which gives an American perspective. The Americans seem to place greater importance on warmth than the British - \"warmly\" and \"warm regards\" both find favour among those surveyed, although breezy \"best\" does have its fans.

'You'd better not do that again, sugar,' he drawled, 'or you'll prompt my fury.'   - A Mickey Spillane Novel That Exists Only In My HeadThe occassional triggering aside, prompting is the main mode of causation in newspapers. Everything is prompted: concerns, MEPs, interests, Arsene Wenger, backlashes, speculation, Chief Rabbis, renewed calls, lies, and even The Guardian. It derives, of course, from the theatrical prompter whose job is to keep the actors prompt with their lines. (For this he has a promptuary). But if the prompter prompts fury in the actor we must always remember that that fury is false. It is only acting.The problem, therefore, of prompting rather than causing is that it makes it sound as though the lines are being fed to the religious group by a prompter.

Put another way: \"let you and I go\" is as wrong as \"let I go\". It should be \"me\". Me, me, me, me, me.Let us go then, you and me,When the evening is a tumpty-tee...No.This is a problem for a pedant. What, really, is the point of all this grammatical, syntactical, linguistic brou-ha-ha if you can ignore it all and still write some of the finest lines in English?What, indeed, about Our Mutual Friend? When two things are mutual each stands in the same relation to the other. There can be mutual love and mutual hate but there can be no third party in a mutual relationship. It should, were the rules obeyed, be called Our Shared Friend. A Dickens-loving pedant would probably proffer the excuse that the line is attributed in the book to Silas Wegg and that the whole joke is that Wegg is illiterate yet pretentious. They would then return to altering the punctuation in Shakespeare, muttering that dear old Charles do the police in different voices.Such defenders of Dickens would, I am afraid, be no more convincing than Mr Curdle. Dickens got it wrong. Eliot got it wrong. I do not even believe that he sacrificed \"me\" for the rhyme. Yet their wrongness did not detract from their genius because the beauty of the lines and the clearness of thought were not impaired. I would not alter a jot or even a tittle of Eliot's lines any more than I would point out to Botticelli how wrong the anatomy is in the Birth of Venus. Beauty cannot be wrong, nor can the deliberate be mistaken.So, it's probably worth saying something about the subject of this blog. I am not here to assert by force of arms the hegemony of grammar over sense or by dint of pandiculation the rule of dictionary definitions over perfectly good new uses. Oblivious may be defined in the dictionary as forgetting, but everybody now uses it to mean never having noticed and that is, quite simply, that.

Even celebrity disc jockeys are not safe from such acts of violence – according to today’s Daily Mail, the “loudmouth DJ” Chris Moyles is also “facing the axe”. In real life, nobody refers to “axing” (or indeed, “slashing”) employees. Cutting jobs, possibly. Redundancies, firings, sackings – certainly. Even, in management-speak, rationalisation or reducing headcount. But fortunately the axe-wielding chief executive is a figure seldom seen outside the gore-spattered pages of our national press.Reducing the headcountMove along. Nothing to see here.I was distressed to read this in The Times today:CHIEF SCIENTIST SPEAKS OUT TO SUPPORT SACKED ADVISER'S STANCE ON CANNABISIt wasn't anything to do with drugs that worried me.  It was that the headline made me realise that in all my long and fruitless life I don't think that I have ever spoken out.  Not once.  I'm not even sure what speaking out is or how it would differ from simply speaking.  I've spoken up more times than I can remember. Indeed I've spoken up, of, about, over (other people), in (tongues and bad French), down (to everybody), under (my breath and caution), from (experience), on, to, and even - I think - at; but never out. This is, I realise, a failing in me and I'm going to do my best to rectify it.  I may be in the gutter, but I'm dreaming of a bigger, better gutter.1,195 people speak, spoke or have spoken out in British news in the last week although a fair proportion of these outspeakers seem to be one young lady with the implausible name of Rihanna. Well, folks, I'm going to change, starting today.  I'm going to start speaking out.  As of now I promise to become a lot less like me and a lot more like Rihanna. I feel particularly guilty about the whole speaking-out thing because as a child my favourite poem was Horatius by Lord Macaulay about the dauntless three defending the bridge over the Tiber.  I used to sit on my father's knee and he would read it to me.Then out spake Spurius Lartius; a Ramnian proud was he: \"Lo, I will stand at thy right hand and keep the bridge with thee.\" And out spake strong Herminius; of Titian blood was he: \"I will abide on thy left side, and keep the bridge with thee.\" Yet out I have never spake. Were those happy days of my infancy wasted?  I think we both know the answer is yes.  I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.\"  Then Rihanna and I will go and defend bridges.  Rihanna ought to be good at that.

{"title": "The Mysterious Swathe", "date": "Sunday 1 November 2009", "text": "Swathes, as any fule kno, are either vast or cut, almost never both. It's one of those strange words that probably means something but nobody really knows what, which is why it is so beloved of journalists. It sits upon the page like a smudge or the grey spot in an old man's eyesight. A company owns vast swathes of something and as long as one doesn't concentrate too hard one can satisfy oneself that the company probably has an awful lot. 'That company', one can say knowledgably, 'owns swathes of land. Swathes.' And if your interlocutor is so impertinent as to ask how much that is one can frown wisely. 'Vast, I should say. Almost certainly vast.'I confess that I had absolutely no idea what a swathe was until a couple of minutes ago. I had even managed to live a fairly happy life in this state of porcine ignorance. But happiness is overrated so I looked it up and discovered that a swathe can definitely be cut. Indeed, it has to be cut. Unfortunately, though, it can't be vast, which I feel will be a blow to British journalism.A swathe is that area of grass that can be cut with a single stroke of a scythe. I have not subjected this to empirical experiment, of which I disapprove, but even assuming quite long arms and the biggest scythe that could still reasonably be considered wieldy I can't really see that coming to much more than ten feet across. A swathe can also be a line cut through a field by single scythe-wielding rustic. So it could be quite long, but its lack of width, I fear, must disqualify it from the label of vast.I admit that I felt a little disappointed at how small a swathe really was. I had hoped that it would at least be a few acres, maybe even a bovate. However, I was able to console myself that the swathes of countryside that today's Telegraph told me would be destroyed are not that important at all. And the British army will hardly even notice the cuts suggested in today's Express. So all in all I consider the dwindling of the swathe a Good Thing For Britain.A reverse of this situation applies to the humble-sounding peck, as in \"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled pepper\" or \"You'll eat a peck of dirt before you die.\" A peck is not, as one might fondly have thought, the amount that a sparrow can fit in its mouth. A peck is two gallons and can even mean simply \"a very large amount\", which makes Peter Piper's feat of pickled pepper picking much more tiring.The hidden human cost of journalistic cliche"},

I was just setting up the mantrap outside my front door and was about to start boning up (odd phrase) on the legality of stabbing children in the face through one's letterbox when I glanced in the mirror and was reminded of the word Eldritch. It's a useful little epithet meaning \"weird, unnatural, hideous\". In fact, it's derived (probably) from the Anglo-Saxon for other kingdom (el rice). So it gets across the idea both of ugliness and of the supernatural in one word which more than compensates for the disadvantage that nobody will know what you're talking about.There's a book by Philip K. Dick called The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch about a chap who has gone on a long journey and come back changed into something horrible and weird. It's rather a good novel all round, but the cliche on the cake for me is the name Palmer Eldritch. You see in the Medieval period pilgrims returning from Jerusalem would bring palm leaves as a memento, which was itself in memory of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem on a donkey when there was of course a shout about the poor animal's ears and palms beneath his feet.Anyway, a palmer is a pilgrim. As Chaucer put it:Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimagesAnd palmeres for to seken straunge strondes [shores]So Palmer Eldritch, who has gone on a journey and come back changed into a hideous monster, is a palmer eldritch, with the adjective being used postpositively.Philip K.

{"title": "Accidental Acrostics", "date": "Thursday 29 October 2009", "text": "In Auden's poem \"It was Easter as I walked in the public gardens\" there's a five line section that goes like this:Fading in silence, leaving them in tears. And recent particulars come to mind;The death by cancer of a once hated master,A friend's analysis of his own failure,Listened to at intervals throughout the winterI have never been utterly certain whether the word FATAL, spelled out in the first letter of each line, was intentional. The poem is nearly a hundred lines long and there are no other acrostics. It could be a case of infinite monkeys and typewriters. Yet having flicked, unscientifically, through the rest of the book I can't spot any other candidates, except for \"OW\". To my knowledge, Auden's only other reference to acrostics came in \"A Happy New Year\" where he wrote \"I warned them of spies in acrostic odes\", so perhaps FATAL was intentional and Auden not simply an infinite monkey.I was reminded of all this by a letter from Arnold Schwarzenneger to the California state legislature that has been kicking around the internet for the last few days.At first blush (whatever that is) Mr Schwarzenegger's effort seemed much more impressive than Auden's. Auden had had control over his own line-breaks whereas the great actor had managed it in prose, and hadn't even needed to cheat by using courier. Moreover, he had filled it out with such blissfully trite politicisms - \"major issues are overlooked\", \"brought to the table\" - that I was quite ready to throw my Complete Auden out of the window and devote myself to il miglior fabbro. But just before I did so Schwarzenegger's press office released a statement (lovely phrase - I imagine them opening a lorry on the African savannah. The statement blinks at first in the sunlight. It sniffs cautiously, creeps forward and then, breathing the clear air of freedom, the statement is gone! Bounding into the long grass while the PR people who have raised it since it was a mewling pup watch with a tear in each eye: one for joy, one for sadness) the gubernatorial press office has, as I say, released a statement saying that the acrostic was simply a \"strange coincidence\". So perhaps I was wrong about Auden.A busy day in the gubernatorial press officeI'm rather fond of the verb to name as in \"Capello names his team\" or \"woman names her attacker\". I imagine it to be like a christening. I always hope that the sentence will continue, as in \"Andrew Strauss named his wicket keeper Susan\" or \"Woman names her attacker Dennis. 'It sort of suits him,' she explained.\"The usual spoken English equivalent would be \"Woman says who her attacker was\", but I suppose that would use to much ink.It sits well with the beautiful phrase \"named and shamed\", which is, incidentally, a nice account of what Adam did in the Garden of Eden.\"And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field\" Gen.

If the headline had been phrased the other way it would have been 'David Cameron said, \"Tony Blair....\"'. The viewer would have thought to himself, 'Well he would say that, wouldn't he?' and relapsed into a deeper slumber. The same habit applies to print journalists.\"People will need to consider turning vegetarian if the world is to conquer climate change, according to a leading authority on global warming,\" said The Times today on page one.Its second article, on page three (this being The Times), began, \"A helicopter crash that killed three servicemen today was caused by inadequate \"administration, airmanship and discipline\" on the part of the Royal Air Force, a coroner ruled today.\"Neither statement means a thing until one knows who has made it. With the wearisome patience of a perturbed parent one can see why the sentences were so strangely inverted: they wanted your attention. Like so many perturbed parents one must secretly mourn Herod's death.However, before I jump, shrieking, at the throat of journalistic syntax, it is, perhaps, worth noting an oddity of novelists.In spoken English the name of the speaker almost always precedes what is said. I said, 'Hello.' He said, 'Oh hell.' Yet in novels the inverse applies. At least, novelists never begin with the speaker's name.I have just reached, without getting up, for a novel - The Death of Ivan Ilyich, since you ask - opened it at random and found:'No,' he answered briefly.and'No,' he repeated. 'I am grateful for it.'Novelists do not write as people speak, or people do not speak as novelists write: I cannot be sure which. The speaker is at the end or is inserted, sometimes after only a word, so long as he does not begin. Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, the pulp crime novelists, are the only exceptions to this rule that I know. Novelists, though, maintain this inversion through a lazy convention. Their motive is different to that of journalists.The overcast gloom of certainty tell me that neither Huw Edwards nor his autocue writer were gesturing towards the verbal glories of early twentieth century American prose. They are only hoping for your attention, for a few seconds' attention, only until the end of the sentence. For that pittance, for that twitch in the eyelid of the somnolent viewer they are prepared to sacrifice all future attention, for like most tricks this inversion can be used only once and then we tire. There seems to be, below this, a problem with newspapers in general. Newspapers believe that nobody wants them. They believe in their own irrelevance, beating on the ground like the old man in The Pardoner's Tale. No editor seems able to say with confidence, 'The idiot has shelled out 90p for my paper. He must want to read articles so we don't need to trick him into doing so.' Instead he acts like the girl who is still desperately trying to get your attention after you've bought her a drink. I was watching the news. I was not going to switch channels before Mr Edwards had finished his sentence. But maybe that's only because my reactions are too slow.(For anyone who wants a sample of Dashiell Hammett's dialogue here is a man addressing the woman he loves:He said, 'I'm going to send you over. The chances are you'll get off with life. That means you'll be out again in twenty years. You're an angel. I'll wait for you.' He cleared his throat. 'If they hang you I'll always remember you.') Too quick for meBranding cattle is a cruel yet oddly pleasurable business. You take a piece of steel that has been bent into a distinctive shape, often so that it spells out a word. Then you heat it over a fire until it is glowing red. Now, get somebody to hold the cow still. Now press the burning metal against the living flesh and watch the scar form.These from recent newspapers:Hugh Grant has been branded a love-rat by his secret Polish girlfriend Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC branded the PC, 24, a \"show-off\" Griffin branded 'bigot' by rabbi's son Nobody has ever used the word branded in spoken English as a synonym for called. I must therefore happily assume all of these cases to be of literal branding, and shall probably have to take the precaution of disposing of my secret Polish girlfriend.(As an incidental aside, there was once a rancher in Texas named Maverick who refused to brand his cattle. He did this not through some soppy sympathy for his bovine brethren, but because he was therefore able to claim all unbranded cattle as his own. So notorious did his practice become that Texan politicians who didn't belong to any political party were called Maverick. Hence the modern meaning of the word and the character so touchingly portrayed by Tom Cruise in Top Gun)Hugh Grant is recovering in hospital"}
