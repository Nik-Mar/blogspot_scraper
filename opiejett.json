Here's to ya:All of you, my darlings, will never truly know how important you have been to me this past year.  You've been wonderful!  Even if you prefer to lurk (HI SOPHIE!) I know you're out there, because I've embedded a Txl4 virus in the 'reply' box    because I can hear you giggling behind my shower curtain   I forgot where I was going with this.  But thank you for stopping by nonetheless. I appreciate each one of you and the things you have to say.  Reading your blogs is a bright spot in my day, even if I don't always comment. I'm just as freaked out by the Tx14 comment virus as you are   Some days the clams won't let me   Did I keep my last New Years resolution?  Yes. I resolved to read The Classics, and I did. A good many of them, in fact. My takeaway is this:  1. Thomas Hardy is a little over-represented.  2. A lot of ancient Greeks and Romans are only famous because nobody thought to use certain scrolls as toilet paper. This year's resolution?  I'm thinking I would like to have a side hustle. A little something that brings in cash.  This will take some creative thinking, but that's what resolutions are all about - masochism  hiding from the robot airships  broadening one's horizons.  I mean at the very least.  So here's to me putting this out there!Gratuitous drag king-age      And here's to you! Here's me hoping you all have an astounding 2024, you wonderful people!  My wish is that the light you shine comes back to you tenfold and the good you do comes back ten times more.  Here's to you all, heroes every one!"},
{"title": "Just The Facts", "date": "Thursday, December 28, 2023", "text": "The facts are these:The Biker and I (note the specific language here) had an absolutely LOVELY HOLIDAY!  We did!  And Boxing Day was wonderful too!  We hung out and drank eggnog and treated ourselves to some thoroughly decadent meals.  Him and I, kids, had a great holiday. We did.It's the rest of the family that needs to be stuffed into a sack.  To sum up:  We should have thought to turn our phones off.  Fortunately, there was plenty of eggnog.___________________________________________________ I do not have a hat head.  I don't. Not a regular hat head anyway.  I put a hat on, most hats, it begins slipping and tipping and grabbing my hair and it falls off. Most hats make me look like an egg-shaped lunatic.Ah, but give me a hat with a brim and suddenly I am a star.  I'm not bragging, just stating the facts. For years now my go to has been the Flat Cap. Not to be confused with the eight-paneled Newsie - that's the one the Peaky Blinders wore:        Not this one. No no no no no. Looks like a cowflop.       THIS one. Yes yes yes yes yes!       The Flat Cap and I were made for each other. Flat Caps - Tweed, Linen & Wax (hannahats.com)Anyway, I had one that I loved, and that I had paid a fair amount of money for years ago, because life is too short to go around wearing sad, cheap hats. That hat was perfectly tailored.  Flat sides, angled back, a relaxed straight shot to the brim, no snap, no buttons or tags or pompoms.  Glorious in every respect. That lovely hat got lost in the flood. I was so bummed.  But guess what the Biker brought in from our storage place today? That's right! My hat!  And I am so happy!  I am wearing it right now!  (note from the future: I wore it for the rest of the day and forgot I had it on.)I've been wearing a flat cap for...longer than I care to admit, now that I stop to do the math. Never mind how long. I looked damn good in my yoooth; I look better now, it can be argued, since my grey hair has come in very wiry and full, like a Karl Marx effect, less the beard. I look like a savage jazz aficionado with strong Communist leanings. __________________________________________Because we already have everything, for the last fifteen years or so we've been buying ourselves a 'house' gift for Christmas. You get to a certain age and you're just all gifted out. That and we've done a lot of buying low and selling high over the years, and once a lot of things have crossed your table, 'things' stop being special.That is why we have a brand-new carpet cleaner under the tree this year.Now if this had been a gift to me, from the Biker I'd still be pissed off.      \"The fuck you think I am, the help? Giving me this utilitarian bullshit for Christmas. No, you fucked up, you can't take it back now, it's done, I see what you think of me, it's fine, I'll just clean the Goddamn carpets now because I'm apparently the maid\" and so on. But if we discuss this shit and agree on it together, it's absolutely fine. Not only that, it makes for an astounding Christmas.  Bring on the industrial lathe. Wheel in the riding lawnmower. How about a new chain hoist, a car, a stainless-steel prep table for the kitchen...absolutely no romance whatsoever, no surprise, no wrapping paper, no bow, no illusion of scarcity or uniqueness, just an invoice - and it's fantastic!  I mean it. You get to gloat and congratulate one another on your combined practicality, and you get an amazing, cozy feeling of togetherness and accomplishment just knowing that this stuff is going to make your life together more comfortable and efficient. Plus we have lots of recreationals and rockin' chow.   It's open house up to New Years Eve here! Stop on by! You drink, you can smoke, you can snort off the top of the toilet tank if it suits ya. You can plink squirrels, you can visit the ancestral land of my people, you can play your music loud and dance how you want to dance. Hell, there's a brand-new carpet cleaner for you to admire too!"},

{"title": "A-Rudolph the arf arf arf arf! Was a very arfy arf!", "date": "Saturday, December 23, 2023", "text": "The church I went to as a kid was an architectural marvel in it's day. No, it really was.  Take a look:St. Johns Catholic Church, Milwaukie, Oregon. The tall swoopy-uppy thing is the church proper. Underneath that tall swoopy-uppy thing is the huge, huge sanctuary. The ceiling really does go all the way up into that spire.         To give you some faint idea of how huge this place is inside     People used to come in from all over Oregon to attend mass here just to say they had, it was that famous. Infamous, really, as every older person still able to piss dust hated it with every atom of their being.  I thought it was cool as heck and I still do.  It looks like it was built by Klingons.  I say boring baroque decor might be good enough for other Catholics. We in Milwaukie were Swanky Catholics and very modern indeed. Qapla!!As hard to love as this interior is, my very favorite Christmas memory took place there.  It was a High mass, and I was about seven years old, and the pomp and circumstance had just about worn me out.  Suddenly all the lights went out. No warning. It was completely silent. At first people gasped. After a few moments more, they'd begin to shift and whisper.  And then the candle above the tabernacle was lit, one tiny little point of light shining in the middle of this immense church.  Then the priest began to sing 'Silent Night', and hesitantly the congregation began to join him. He took a taper and lit it from the tabernacle candle, and he went around and lit all the candles on the altar. The sacristans took the light from him then, and went around the whole sanctuary, to all the votives and all the devotionals and lit them.  At the end of the song he simply said \"Christ is born.\"It's my favorite Christmas memory. And it's of Christmas - not fake Happy Holidays Christmas, where people get in fistfights over Playstations and send 34,000 cards and dash around to visit people they don't like. I left fake Christmas behind and I am better for it. _______________________________I am probably the only American who hates the Christmas Classic 'Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer'. I hate the song, and I hate the holiday T.V. special. I do.For some reason my dad was really taken by the song, but he'd just go around and yodel the words \"Rudolph the red nosed reindeer!  Had a very shiny nose!\" at random. Starting two months leading up to Christmas. And he'd change the words. \"a-Rudolph the Red-Nosed Hoosegoooooow!  Had a ve - hry shiny schnooooo!\" And he thought this was utterly hilarious, particularly when my mother got sick of hearing it fifteen times a day and began to yell. Then he'd just do it more. \"Rudolph the woof woof a-reindeer!  He had a very shiny nose you know!\"  Now this may sound like fond holiday hijinks, but honestly by the week leading up to Christmas mom and I were ready to shoot the guy. It was demented. He'd answer the phone like this. He'd chase me around the house singing this.  I hid in our basement once, iot got so dumb, and I could hear him prowling around upstairs looking for me going \"Rudolph the Goose nose a-honk honk! Had a very goosey goose! Are ya here?  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Red Nose! Was a very rainy day! Are ya here?\"\"SHADDUP!\" My mom would shout. That was the sound of the holidays at my house until my mom took the record off the player one day and broke it over her knee. My dad howled like she'd bit him. Honestly, he's lucky she didn't.Now as for the T.V. special, let's just say it's a matter of taste. If you like this, you have no taste.\"OK OK so this is a good one, Rudolph. Guy walks into a theatrical agents office. 'So you wanna work in Vaudeville, huh? the agent asks. What kind of act ya got?'  OK OK now, and the guy goes 'Well, first my wife comes out and pulls a sweet potato straight out of her...\"Stop-motion animation has always given me the heebie jeebies. Clearly those things are dolls. Am I supposed to believe they're magic dolls that move and sing?  What weird reality is this? And why does it suck? I can trace my dislike of this saccharine offering to the vocal talents of Burl Ives. Burl Ives ruins everything. (Wow, I am desecrating all the holiday traditions, huh?  Look at me go.) I think the UK term for his sound is 'treacly'. Yes. Burl Ives was treacly.  Now he is dead.____________________________________So I began this post with a very gentle Christmas reminisce, and now here I am at the end and I've nearly written down the text of the dirtiest joke in the world (The Aristocrats) and it wasn't on purpose; I'm just writing down this and that.  I think I better leave it at this, OK?Merry Christmas to all!"},
{"title": "All is Revealed", "date": "Sunday, December 17, 2023", "text": "I know two culinary secrets. Just two. That I can remember. At the moment.Secret one - the thing about teriyaki sauce and Mexican food....oh! I should explain. That mystery flavor that you just can't seem to duplicate at home?  It's teriyaki sauce. When you order that sizzling fajitas platter, that's what you're tasting in the meat marinade, as well as in most of the beef dishes. Yup. Teriyaki sauce. Ole.________________________________________________________I am sorry to tell you this but that thing is not Photoshop.  It is a liver pate en gelatine with a glaze of buttermilk...stuff. Sorry.                   I wondered:  Why are there so many Jello salads and congealed salads and aspics and shit in vintage cookbooks?  Why was I chosen to live in the 1960s when that stuff was everywhere?  Why, God? My answer, after much research:  Because of Auguste Escoffier, The King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings.   His star turn was fancy aspics, gelees, molds and terrines. His cookbook is full of the things. They were arguably the signature dishes at his ultra fashionable restaurant, The Savoy, which was the combined Alinea/ French Laundry of its day, the top destination for innovative fine dining, the place you went to see the rich and famous eat frogs' legs and pretend to like them.It must have seemed like the absolute last word in trendy dining, having those glimmering, colorful  dishes land on your table, so novel, so special;  so unlike the utilitarian slop you ate at home. Jellies and aspics began appearing on tables all over America as soon as that first Escoffier cookbook landed in the stores back in 1903. The reason for its huge popularity here in the U.S.? It was novel as ol' Billy Heck - and it was pretty. How fancy!  How refined!  What a lovely conceit!  Pretty food...not just well presented, but turned into a heap of jewels! EDIBLE FREAKING JEWELS OMGWTFBBQ       Look at how pretty this is!  This is a terrine en croute and it's held together with neutral gelatine and sheer good looks. Nothing about it says 'Ordinarily we'd throw out hard boiled eggs this old'!         Back in 1903, America was still struggling to be seen as a place just as cultured as the Old World. What could possibly be more sophisticated than serving such pretty food in your home? Why you must be very very wealthy indeed. Who ever heard of such a notion; I swannee. Jellies and aspics on the family table meant you were daring and debonaire and had quite refined tastes indeed. You had travelled, you had tasted, and by God you were sophisticated as fuck. Meanwhile Katy is in the kitchen boiling the crap out of bones that she'd been saving out of the week's meals. YES. YES. That was then. By the time I came along, Jello molds were entering a new era of glamour, and were now being pushed as a low-calorie food. Suddenly it was the magic solution! Go to any buffet and see women loading up their plates like Mt. Fujiama with whatever Jello atrocity was on offer, no matter how much cheese, sugar or cream was in the thing, and listen to those women swear by all that was holy that every item on their plate was low-cal.  Just bear with me here. Jello came in vibrant colors and sugary fruit flavors. Most home cooks came from a background of c-grades, limited choices and necessity food, like parsnips and oatmeal and probably gravel and chunks of bark and shit.  I remember horrible Jello salads filled with pineapple and celery, suspended in a ruby red mound of cherry-flavored Jello, people, and being told by my mother \"You just concentrate on the Jello. The other stuff will just slip down.\" This is real, people. This was a thing people ate.  Jello was not only a magical calorie-canceller, it had also become a way to camouflage the food your family refused to eat. I mean, I get the idea; it's Jello! Jello is fun! Jello tastes like candy! So what if there's kohlrabi in that Lime flavored Jello salad? Just concentrate on the Jello and let the rest slip down!Here's the punchline.  Escoffier glammed up the common terrine (which later morphed into the Jello Mold Salad) with truffles, vegetables cut into fancy shapes and garnishes as a way to get rid of ends, peelings, scrapings and stuff about to go by in his restaurant kitchen.  Yup. Grind it up, add some pungent seasonings and some aspic; then send it out onto the floor to wild acclaim. Well, with a sauce too; come on. He wasn't a total barbarian. But there  he was doing the same thing as the ladies in the late 1960's were doing - hiding everything you didn't want to eat under a coating of jiggly, glistening legerdemain.  His genius shines through in that he charged people dearly to eat this stuff and laughed all the way to the bank. Your aunt just thinks you're stupid.* ________________________       OK then! Now you know why your great aunt keeps bringing that raspberry Jello with peas and parsnips thing to your family get togethers. The old dear thinks it's classy. You've got four things you can do when you find yourself in this situation: 1. Tell her 'It's just too pretty to eat!' and use it as a centerpiece  2. Niggle out a serving that's all Raspberry Jello and hide your efforts by shooting a fuck-ton of Kool Whip on it 3. Open the door and sling it outside like a Frisbee 4. Put her in a home__________________________________________________*Hell, they'll never notice the squash and onions under a coating of Orange flavored Jello!\"** Anyone in the UK recognize these people?  I give you:  My Evil Aunt – Many have one, I have two!"},
{"title": "Your First Fun FirstNations Fact!", "date": "Thursday, December 14, 2023", "text": "That last post got me thinking. I worked as a maid for years, and I worked my way up from the hot-sheet places to The Hilton, and finally into private home situations where all I did all day was listen to the lady of the house reminisce. One nice lady who lived in Golden Gardens used to make me Swedish Krumkakke! THEY PAID ME TO EAT KRUMKAKKE!!Out of all those different places over all those years, the place where I ran into the most creeps was the one I wrote about when last we met - The RoseVilla in Portland, Oregon. -YES yes I know I called it the City Center in my last post. I was wrong. The City Center was on the other side of the river and was all kinds of skanky. The Rose Villa was plush.  It also had the worst customers by far.  And hey, look at you, you lucky thing! Here comes another sleazy tale from the Rose Villa!One fine day I was going down the line cleaning the poolside suites. Now for those of you who have never been a chambermaid/bellman, your opening 'maid service' gambit goes like this:1. Knock in a sharp, no-nonsense way. This is best accomplished with the knuckle of your pointer finger, and I have the arthritis to prove it. RAPRAPRAPRAP.2. Announce 'Maid Service!' in a cheerful yet businesslike tone of voice. Make sure people in other rooms can hear you. Not kidding. 3. Listen at the door. Don't flatten your face up against it, just bend near. Keep that shit classy.4. Knock again. RAPRAPRAPRAP.  Say 'Maid Service!' in a cheerful yet businesslike tone of voice again. Make sure people in other rooms can hear you again. Listen at the door again.5. Count to ten. 6. If you hear nothing, open the door a smidge and announce 'Maid Service!' in the same cheerful yet businesslike tone of voice that is also loud, and enter s l o w l y.  7. Cautiously draw your gun make sure nobody is in that room - not in the closets, in the shower, under the sink, in the cabinets; not in the bed, not suspended from the ceiling in a leather harness like Dabney Coleman. NOBODY shouldn't be in that room that didn't say there were going to be in that room, which makes enough sense for now.8. Leave the exterior door open behind you at all times. This latter was a rule specific to the RoseVilla Hotel*. 9. Commence cleaning the room. Top to bottom, back to front.On this particular morning I made it as far as #7. The instant I turned the bathroom doorknob I heard someone inside. I said \"Excuse me!\" and stepped away fast. It doesn't pay to be too careful when you are a woman working alone in a room, and our policy at the Rose Villa was very clear: whenever something iffy happened, you immediately went to the office in person to report it.* I was halfway across the lot when I heard a shout behind me. I turned and looked. There on the sidewalk outside stood a naked, red-haired man shouting in a squeaky tone of voice and waving something over his head. I could not make out what he was saying, but I could tell that what he was waving overhead was a pair of red swimming trunks. Let's revisit that image just so we get it firmly fixed in our imaginations, shall we? He had blazing red hair, was blazing red naked, was out on the sidewalk in front of his room; and was waving his bathing suit over his head.  And shouting. I ran into the office like wild dingo doggies were after me. \"There's a naked guy on the sidewalk out there,\" I said to the desk clerk. The desk clerk looked out the window. \"I don't see anybody.\"I explained the whole thing.\"I didn't see him,\" the desk clerk maintained. \"Oh!  You caught me you sassy lil' peckerhead!  I just ran into the office on company time to lie to you!\" I didn't say. Just then the phone rang, and the desk clerk answered it. I could hear a high-pitched voice ranting down the line, while Desk Clerk kept up a steady stream of 'I'm so sorry' and 'Oh my.' \"That was the man in room 220,\" he said. \"He said you...were in there.\"  And he said this was an odd little lilt in his voice. \"I was,\" I said. \"Briefly. I told you -\"\"Well he just said...you were in there.\"  The desk clerk sat there like a watery mole and blinked at me. \"I was. I just said. I knocked, and -\"\"He said you made him an...offer,\" said the clerk.  \"I mean...he's checked in as Reverend Paterson, so I tend to believe, I mean...\" and this utter waste of skin had the nerve to give me this little moue of disapproval. \"I mean after all, you're a maid.\"I was to find out that Reverend Naked not only complained about me 'propositioning' him, he complained about his room not having been done that day (it was, later, by a bellman.) He stayed for a week. By the end of that week we were all refusing to do his room.  He ended up being stuffed into a squad car because he'd gotten drunk and disorderly - and handsy - in our lounge. The cops took him down to Burnside** and kicked him out, which was common practice in those palmy days of carefree police harassment.  We never heard from him again - and we still had his luggage. Now that I think back I wonder if the owner had been pouring tales into the desk clerks' ear, or if he just hired the guy on the 'water seeks it's own level' plan. As for the Rev?  If it weren't for nuts there wouldn't be a hotel trade.  There's no decent ending to this one. -well, I left for greener pastures, yeah. That's good. _________________________________Your Fun FirstNations Fact:  This is the second time in my life that I've been chased by a naked man waving a swimsuit over his head!         There is no picture of a man waving a swimsuit overhead, so here is a picture of a Guy Fieri swimsuit instead. You are welcome. ____________________________*Specific to this place because a. Just the year before a maid had nearly been raped in one of the rooms b. The place was in the center of town c. A lot of our customers were part of a test study being done using DMSO as a carrier agent for psychiatric drugs - so yeah, lots of good reasons. **Burnside was the scabrous Skid Row of Portland.

{"title": "Remembrances of Membrances Remem Berance Ded", "date": "Sunday, December 10, 2023", "text": "The Biker was flicking through some alt cinema this evening when he came upon a movie documentary about Nude Cleaners. This unleashed a torrent of memories from my early days, and once I sat down and sorted through those memories, I thought to myself 'Self, you have had a weird life.'Back when I was a but a First City-State* I worked for a small yet locally prestigious motel-hotel which hosted researchers, specialists and other shit like that from all over the world who came to teach at the local medical school up the hill. Our parking lot would be full of Rolls Royces, our rooms full of self-important pro-social psychopaths, and the restaurant and lounge filled to stinkin' with big brains involved with Medical Research, and therefore Not Obligated To Flush Toilets.  And this was fine with me. They didn't tip, but they left me lots of high-quality pharmaceuticals. And cocaine!  Did I mention the cocaine? There was cocaine.   Oh gracious it was good stuff too.  One fat line and I finished those rooms with wings on and the best darn attitude in the whole wide world!In the Portland of that time there was a semi-legendary person known in Hospitality circles for living in the exclusive West Hills area and being super kinky. This person was said to be a surgeon in residence up at the medical school.  Was he married? Was he single?  Was he gay or straight? Did he even live in Portland?  Nobody knew. Word was, though,  he had a place up in Healy Heights, and he hired Fetish Maids. Well, Fetish maid. One at a time. You would arrive at his place to find an outfit, whatever that might consist of, put it on (or not) and then clean the whole place top to bottom. If you did a good job, you got called back. Otherwise, you found an envelope full of bills on your way out with a note that said, I guess, either 'Take a Hike,' or 'Come Back on Wednesday.' He supposedly watched you on CCTV from some secret location and jacked off or ate live baby mice or whatever freaky people do. This guy was not a legend, come to find out. My boss at the City Center was one of those old school jackasses who thought that the women who worked for him should also suck his dick. I did not agree. So this fuckweasel passed my information on to Fetish Dude.  And I got contacted. Fetish Dude called me at  home. He sounded like a friendly and educated person. He asked me if I took private contracts. He was very professional.At that point in my life I had never been so scared. This freaky person was calling me up out of nowhere and assuming I was the type of person who did shit like that.  I wasn't!  Maybe I should have been. I would have made a stack of cash.  Too late now.I got three phonecalls from this person, and all three times I was non-committal. Fetish guy was evidently no idiot, because I never got another call. It was when I noticed that fuckweasel boss was astounded that I kept on coming in to clean rooms that I put two and two together.And so ends another thrilling take of yesteryear!  Would you have taken Fetish Dude's money?  Have you ever been a professional Erotic Maid/Butler? Do tell!   Share your stories of Chastity Assailed and Virtue Triumphant! unless you don't have any stories like that.

{"title": "The Importance of Being Self-Published", "date": "Thursday, November 30, 2023", "text": "OUR HERO               I am in full agreement with M. Arcati.  Vintage cookbooks are The Shiznizzle. I too collect them, although I'm far too short on room to be accumulating any more books. Well screw room I say.  I love cookbooks. I've gone through my Popular phase, my Serious Classics phase, my OO that's one I don't have phase, and now I am in my Nutjob phase.*  The Nutjobs make up a whole niche category of cookbooks written by folks on the margins of sanity, society, and good taste. This category exploded in the 1960s, as you might imagine. My very favorite one is  Bull Cook and Authentic Historical Recipes and Practices, Volume I, by George Leonard Herter.George Herter was the Baron Munchausen of the cookbook world. If it had not been for self-publishing, this book would never have seen the light of day.  I mean oh holy shit, people, this dude was not just eccentric, and he was not just quirky.    He was flaming batshit crazy. Bull Cook is best described as a fantasy novel about cooking, fictitious shellfish, The Sheer Gall Of Those Italians Thinking They Own The Tomato, and immanent nuclear war. It is also incredibly, incredibly readable, and I mean this sincerely. He has a very engaging style, and frankly you just can't wait to see what kind of weirdness he's going to come up with next, which helps move things along too.  In fact, do you like to get high and read?  Bull Cook is the exact book you want to be reading. I believe this guy really cared about food, and that he must have bothered chefs the wide world over chasing down recipes and techniques. Problem is, you cannot trust any of it. He tells us, for example, to use ANTHACITE FREAKIN COAL in our barbecues. Not charcoal. Never charcoal. Charcoal is dangerous. So yeah, you might be tempted to try this or that, but proceed only after long and careful thought. The rule when reading ol' George is:  George Lies A Lot. He perceives the lack of a fact?  He just yanks a 'fact' straight out of his ass.  I get the feeling that he was the kind of man in life that would just say whatever fell out of his mouth and leave you to deal with it. Kind of like L. Ron Hubbard, or Mr. Natural.There is another argument; that Mr. Herter was just doing the 'wink wink nod nod', engaging in the Manly Art of Bullshit. Sure, it could be so. He might very well have been aiming for that 'hanging out in the duck blind telling dirty jokes, cigar-and-bourbon' kind of tone you'd see in the beer advertising of the day. The guy ran a wildly successful sporting goods operation after all. He marketed to men. Maybe I just don't get it because I wasn't hanging out in the right duck blinds.  Except for the fact that   he was flaming batshit crazy.Let's take a quick riffle through the pages of Bull Cook, shall we?  We are given three paragraphs on How To Make A Peanut Butter Sandwich, and are left with a kitchen in flames and the lingering taste of pickles. Another recipe purports to be for something called Beer Coffee, but meanders through Belgian flax exportation, words originating from the French, and how shitty the food is in the Shannon Airport.  Then we come to the recipe for FRESH WATER OYSTER STEW.  He boils the snot out of these mythical creatures, and then goes on to spend six and a half pages of How Shitty Seattle Seafood Restaurants Are. I don't think he was ever in Seattle. I think he was on another planet entirely smoking crack with Elvis. He tells us about the French Pea-Eating Craze of 1696 (?) and how Anthony Van Leeuwenhoek came to invent the dish Fish Anthony, which calls for canned peas and Campbells Cream of Mushroom Soup. He makes Coquilles St. Jacques out of empty clamshells and boiled fish, and claims this recipe was invented by St. Jacques himself. He speaks of how Ghengis Khan introduced caviar to an unsuspecting Russia. I'm sitting here now with the book open at my side and I'm still finding myself drawn off task. I have spent way too much time reading, fact checking, looking up articles and marveling at this man's special brand of lunacy. This is a compelling read, there's no doubt about it. I have said \"Oh my God no\" so many times the Biker is worried. And yet I'll put the book down and go to type; and a passage will leap up and go for my throat, like 'Salmon Queen Astrid of Belgium' which is made of canned salmon, and \"If the Bourbon Street crowd go into a bar and look up from their drinks and do not see, among other things, a couple of well-formed breasts flopping about, the drink doesn't taste just right and they move to another bar.\" I love this book. Pray for me._________________________________________Because you suddenly feel a whole-body longing to read the prose of George L.

(FAMILY) might have gotten an Atomic Swirlie had that not been the case.And nobody wants an atomic swirlie.       ____________________________ It's the oddest thing, but as I get older, the more I miss the 1970's.Thing is, I hated the Seventies when I was in the Seventies. New furniture was photo finish over chipboard. Granny squares rained down like fallout.  Nobody needed a Bicentennial Toilet, Couch or Bedroom Set, but Sears sold them. Disco existed. People wore denim jumpsuits. Then there was Nixon, 'Nam, and the Chevrolet Citation. Yet here I am now, and here comes someone driving by in a Pinto, and I'll get this warm fuzzy and think 'Aw, that's nice.'And I'm wrong!PINTOS WEREN'T NICE____________________________OK holy shit this whole THING just came to mind. It's one of my pet rants. ____________________________THE FORD PINTO SUCKS THE ASS OF THE GOAT YOU KNOW          Dear God what a piece of garbage the Pinto was. The marketing campaign was garbage. The design was garbage. The engine and drive train were garbage. No, those were worse than garbage. They were proof that there Is No God and that large corporations don't give a shit if you die in flames.  I'll drag you out of this car and kick the shit out of yWHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T FIND MEXICO DAVE   Looking into the engine compartment of a Pinto was appalling. Everything under there, from the thing that held the battery in place to the plastic tape covering the wiring was noticeably, glaringly cheap. Driving a Pinto felt cheap, too.As soon as you started the engine the thing filled with the smell, and the sound, of plastic. As the thing warmed up the smell got stronger and more little plastic voices joined the choir, rattling, buzzing, boinking, ticking. The plastic window cranks would go 'ddddddddddddddddddddddd' unless you jammed a twisted-up napkin in there. The plastic door locks would tweedle themselves up off their pegs until the plastic threads wore out. Then they'd just split and fall off.Stone stock and trashy as the day it was made. Just looking at this pisses me off.     Go ahead. Adjust the timing. Change the plugs. Won't matter. The whole car juddered in time with with the engine stroke, just like a tractor. The windows thrummed.  The mirrors jiggled. You could sit there waiting for a light and watch the screws that held on the window trim ka-deedling out of their holes. Put your foot all the way into a Pinto and all that would happen is a mild increase in speed, which is not the shit you want when you are driving in Seattle traffic. Or any traffic. Luckily this meant you wouldn't be doing any high-speed braking because the brakes were...class? class?  GARBAGE.  The brakes were garbage.The engines were atrocious. All the components were made using with the shittiest materials Ford could get away with. This was known as 'reducing weight for better fuel economy' and Ford did it because 'lower prices mean more people can afford Today's Ford.' And just think - once Todays Pinto burned your parents to death and you inherited, it would be a lot easier for you to buy Tomorrows Ford.  Circle of liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii-ahem. I have brought this subject up in the past and I always get people who pop up with I/my dad/my mom/my whoever owned a Pinto and it was super groovy,  God how I miss that car, I wish I still had it, I had my first date/cardiac event/Yankee Candle party in that Pinto - or my very favorite of all time, the proof that someone is really using those critical thinking skills, the statement that covers all sins:  \"They were great little cars for the time.\" NO. THEY WEREN'T.       __________________________________________*  Why The Ford Pinto Was One Of The Worst Cars Of All Time (hotcars.com)                          The Pinto Memo: ‘It’s Cheaper to let them Burn!’ | The Spokesman-Review                          The Ford Pinto - The American Museum of Tort Law (tortmuseum.org)"},

Naturally, today's modern media is his playground.  Yet imagine my surprise when I found him watching episodes of 'Botched' from nine years ago!  This is generally not his jam. If it's medical, he'd prefer they show up on the autopsy table.  Well, I took me a look.  \"Aha,\" I thought after a few scenes. \"He's watching this for glimpses of bare titty.  Good Lord. Straight men.\"Then I took a second look. \"Holy crap,\" I thought, doing more than my share of mental heavy lifting this particular evening \"These are some familiar faces...?\"So I went online, and between my spotty memory and IMDB I was able to identify several aged 'third shepherd from the left' actors from the Seventies, a future Ru-girl, and a whole lotta potential for an excellent drinking game. From misused medical terms to poor special effects, from bad stage management to 'Didn't I see you playing Judith Lights' sisters' chauffeur on an episode of Columbo?\" this show has it all, including more bad wigs than you can shake a can of Aqua Net at. There is scar tissue. There are bad body doubles. There are doctors who cannot tell the difference between a vagina and a hole in the- yes well.___________________________________Since I am never going to have the chance to travel to all the places I want to go (everywhere, including the past) I love to go on Google Maps > street view and virtually roam.One of the things I've realized doing this is just how fucking huge America really is.   Another thing I've realized is how much of an accomplishment it was to cross all that bullshit in a covered wagon.  Both my grandparents (and their families) did that. Oh, and one uncle who was a Civil War deserter who fucking walked here.Interesting story: they tried to conscript my uncle Karl right off the boat from Germany; and he said kthnxNO and booked it over the purple mountains' majesty and across the fruited plains. The dude went from New Orleans to Milwaukie Oregon afoot, folks. 2517 miles. Speaking no the English.  My grandmother hid him out in an outbuilding when he arrived in the middle of Winter, and then in the Spring he went up the mountain and worked in the woods. You didn't have to know English to work in the woods. You just had to survive, and he sure in the fuck knew how to do that.  He survived knife fights, bare-knuckle bouts, strike breakers and rail bosses.  An old-growth cedar took him out. Not him. ___________________________________________________ I was virtually visiting a tiny-tiny little place in the middle of my home state when I happened across a cemetery in the literal middle of nowhere. No town, no nothing. Not even a road that goes there any more. Just a collection of stones marking the graves of the few people who had settled and died on that land.  Those stones are as perfect as they day they were carved. No vandals have touched them. 1842 to 1902. A single family and their two servants. Dickens was still alive. Poe was still alive. Victoria BC was a clearing in the woods when these people were building their house and opening land to cultivate out along the Columbia River. They came from Germany to a place that no books of the day described truthfully. They had no idea of what to expect and plenty of opportunity for even their most conservative expectations to be crushed. They arrived to find country where the land is all horizon, where the wind is almost ceaseless, where no grass grows, where no trees relieve the view.You think about the dreams those people had and the huge, huge distance that they travelled.  Maybe they were leaving something worse, and maybe here they found a place that might have, for a few years, made them happy.  You're glad they can't see that it all came to nothing.They were killed by Indians."},

I am happy to see October in the rearview.  Yes, it was Halloween last night, but meh. As usual we got no Trick or Treaters, which is fine, because The Biker bought M&M's just in case, and this morning I had el mucho peanut M&M's at hand, and peanut M&M's are precisely what I dined upon for breakfast this fine November first. It was time the Universe smiled on me a little.   __________________________________________________SANDWICH FURY OF THIRTEEN DRAGONS!I love sandwiches. They are portable, they are a handy size and shape, and they are tasty.  You can hold sandwich in one hand and a gun, or a cup of coffee, or a shovel, in the other, and fulfill your nutritional needs while you shoot to kill/get caffeinated/bludgeon someone with a shovel.  I taught myself how to cook when I was very young. The first 'recipes' I invented were for sandwiches, and I had a million of 'em. I invented...1965's Cotto Salami Flap Sandwich which is a couple of pieces of the sleaziest Cotto Salami you can find, put on one slice of the sleaziest white bread you can find, flapped over and then stuffed into the breast pocket of your bibs. Make three - one for each pocket!* and share with Bill Beizer and his sister Ellen way up a big tree.   Then yell for help until someone comes and gets you all down out of the big tree.) ...1970's Huge Bacon Lettuce and Tomato (one sliced fat, drippy, home-grown tomato, six or more crispy slices of bacon, shredded iceburg lettuce, and a mayonnaise that includes olive oil, parmesan cheese, chili flakes, red wine vinegar and oregano, on sourdough.  SO yum.)...1977's Cashew Chicken Salad Sandwich ( chicken salad made with chopped cashews, a little onion, a sprinkle of garlic powder, thin cut celery and celery leaves, an oil and red wine vinegar dressing brought together with a bare dab of mayonnaise and mixed with some cubed chicken breast, then 'blap' on a wad of alfalfa sprouts that are laying on some homemade French bread; which kicks ass.)              I used to keep a food diary, so that's how I remember the dates, before anybody asks. I literally cannot remember my own phone number, but I remember sitting up a huge dogwood tree in 1965 with Bill and Ellen Beiser eating Cotto Salami Flap Sandwiches and then realizing we had clumb* up too far into the branches, and panicking._____________________________  Voulez-vous...you know what I'll just leave this here.   When I saw the New Orleans Muffaleta Sandwich on TV some years back, I said to myself  'Self, that looks absolutely delicious. This needs to happen.' and I did that thing, and it was awesome.  An excellent sandwich in all respects.(This recipe for a Gin-You-Wine Muffaletta Poe-Boy *squaaaak NEVERMORE *  is as good as any out there. Please hit 'jump to recipe' right quick though, or suffer through paragraphs of yadda yadda and ads, because this page is balls deep in monitization.) Ah, but it was the olive salad constituent that captured my heart.  That is some delicious shit.The first thing I did was cut out the giardiniera because life is too short to be eating pickled cauliflower.  That may not be in the giardiniera available to you in Parts Foreign, but that's all we get out here.  Mezzetta Brand Giardiniera.  They put cauliflower in it, and honestly? fuck that. Gawd. Yak. Ew. So it was that I was forced to invent my own olive salad that is one million times of the Universe plus Saturn of deliciouser more better than the shit with cauliflower in it.Now olives can run a little musky and same-o same-o as a flavor. That would not do.  I wanted a ROCKIN' olive salad. Therefore I created...    Not A Tapanade but Also Not Strictly An Olive Salad                                        This will, as always, take longer to read than to do.  ==An equal amount of pitted Kalamata olives, pitted Castelvetrano olives, pimento-stuffed Manzanilla olives, and pitted plain black olives. How much is an equal amount? Try eyeballing the mass and get back to me. I will ignore you. Prepare for that.  This is to your own taste and need for olive salad in your life. Chop these olives until the individual pieces are >(    )< that size. Next, put into a mixing bowl. Not a huge one, just a regular one. Come on use some common sense here.    ==Whole sun-dried tomatoes packed in olive oil - again, this shit varies. And these tend pretty sweet, so be advised. I'd say take one sun dried tomato out and chop it into hair- thin strips, and repeat those actions until you have about 1/6 the mass of the olives in finely chopped sun dried tomatoes.  Got that did? Put into the bowl.     ==Raw Garlic, a heaping teaspoon.  Peel cloves and then put through a press.  Sweat the pulp  in a little olive oil for about 5 minutes. Cool, then add to mixing bowl, oil and all.      ==Scallions (AKA green onions, spring onions) Add as many as you feel lead by the Lord. Chop very fine and add raw to the mixing bowl. You could use plain white minced Bermuda Onions here, but scallions will taste better and look better.== 1 lemons' worth of zested lemon peel. Any size lemon. Go for it. See this thing?  Use this thing. Or use a plain grater, or just a vegetable peeler.  ==1/2 tsp. pulverized anchovy, the kind you squeeze out of a toothpaste tube. You know the stuff. YES ADD IT.==I hesitate to put this here, but I use it.  It takes knowledge of the kind of pepper you use.  One red, sweet pepper, roasted, seeded, peeled and chopped fine. Into the mixing bowl.    Taste taste  taste taste !! Red sweet peppers can be very sweet indeed!  They can also be very complex and wonderful. I have no idea what kind of red pepper you have available or what kind of flavor it has. I am presuming sweet, with a distinct flavor of freshly ground black pepper.  You go by what you like, or skip this entirely.    ==Salt, Pepper - to taste. In we go.    ==Additional olive oil, to taste and to influence spreadability. I like Napoleon Spanish Olive Oil because it's peppery.  You could instead use ghee. Do not cheap out and use margarine or any other commonly used cooking oil (vegetable, rapeseed, corn, peanut, soybean, cottonseed no no no no.)==SECRET INGREDIENT:  Now this is going to take some tasting and a lot of care and discretion. The ingredient is    Citric Acid    And the measurement is 'enough to coat a damp teaspoon' to begin with. Use very, very little indeed.This is the first ingredient I've come across that offers such a huge, immediate difference to flavors - and then stays stable. There is no window of oxidization or number or hours to marinate. Let's say you've made a Bolognaise sauce and it tastes muddy because you might have overcooked that pup. The very barest amount of Citric Acid - a mere dusting!- added to your saucepan of muddy Bolognaise will separate all the flavors and bring them to the forefront vividly. Similarly olive salad!  A bare trace of citric acid will bring the flavor of each ingredient to the forefront, and the added trace of sourness will augment the whole.                        *Watches tracers form on passing hand.  Does this for 45 minutes.* So you get the drift, then. Add just a cunthair bit of Citric Acid, stir, and the taste. Keep doing this until you suddenly begin to taste everything separately. It could happen with that first damp teaspoon!  Or it might take a tiny bit more. Once everything springs to life, stop right there. Do not add another bit. You are done.  ---Now all you do is stir all these ingredients very thoroughly together. You want the juices to mingle. Stand there and stir until your feet begin to hurt.  Maybe call a friend you haven't heard from in awhile and catch up. Meanwhile you're stirring, and the olives and stuff are making a 'glick slish glick glick gaslosh' sound as you stir, right? and your buddy will think you're getting a blow job! Choice!==Put in sealed container and store in refrigerator. Use as a sandwich spread, although don't let me dictate your culinary limits. It's fantastic in an omelette, or on pasta, or just out of the jar. Also in Pork Roulade with a lot of rosemary. Or on a white pizza. Or in a tagine!!! FUCK YEAH CHICKEN TAGINE+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   This Olive Salad is meant, however, to be great on a Muffaletta Sandwich. Do I make an authentic New Orleans Muffaletta Sandwich?  I do not. I doubt that even the originators of the Muffaletta Sandwich still make an authentic Muffaletta Sandwich anymore. Nobody wrote that shit down back when, and everybody who ever ate an original one is dead now.  Maybe I'm doing you a huge favor by not having that original recipe at hand. Here's a sandwich it's good on.  It has muffaletta-ish ingredients, but then again maybe it doesn't. The Oregon Sandwich \"Tastes like liberal politics and aggressive waterfowl!\"                                                                        \"We're here!                                                                         Craft beer!                                              Something something rhymes with 'eer!\"        ==One dense white bread-type sandwich roll with a thick crust - split, and some of the fluff taken out of both pieces to form a bit of an indentation.  Chunk the fluff out the back door for the birds, or stand there and eat it like a kid. I do.==Cold cuts:  Mortadella, gypsy salami, and capicola==Cheese:  Provelone and Swiss==The olive salad I just gave you the recipe for~~~~~~~~---Slap a nice thick layer of olive salad on the top and bottom bun. Stack cold cuts and cheese on top. Any amount, either bun or both. ---Stack sandwich back together, and be neat. Make sure that things are spread out equally.  It's important, because of the next step.---Place whole sandwich in a container, and put a weight on top of the sandwich. Yes. Seriously. Don't squish it as hard as you can, and don't step on it. Put a brick, or a cast iron skillet, inside a stout Glad bag and rest that on your nicely stacked sandwich, and let it all sit in the refrigerator for six hours and get flattened down. Yes I do this. Yes it is worth it.Make this sandwich in the morning and then in the afternoon, take it out and eat that sapsucker.  Weighting it makes it taste better in an indefinable way - far better than if you just put the sandwich together and then chowed down on the spot. And don't get me wrong; that's an excellent sandwich, but the pressed version is a MORE EXCELLENT SANDWICH.***_______________________________________*Only works with Carhart bibs. ** Clumb is, as you may have guessed, is the past tense of 'clumbed.'***I remember a show called Two Fat Ladies, a cooking program from the UK. The premise was, two fat ladies - imagine it -  cooking stuff. One of the things they prepared was a Shooter's Sandwich. The Shooters' Sandwich is also a pressed sandwich, and it too is better for having been pressed all day and chilled. WHY IS THIS SO????? It is one of the Sandwich Mysteries."},

We would move to Kentucky and I don't know, just motorcycle around looking at poverty or something.Because Kentucky is not a place where most people have a lot of money. You won't find a lot of liberal politics there either. What you will find is hundreds of dying little towns scattered throughout the mountains, remote as fuck, (only accessible by presumably beautiful motorcycling roads) inhabited by the seventy-year-old results of generational incest, captive workforce politics, and fundamentalist religion. -folks, it's not a stereotype because it never happens that way.

I had a post in mind, and to me at that time it seemed only moderately scary and like something I could treat lightly.  So I went on a search around the Internet for my ex-husband's picture, found a recent one, and scared the living shit out of myself over the period of a day.My ex-husband was not a wonderful guy. He did crimes. He did bad crimes.  Thing was, the guy was all charm. He had everybody snowed.  Plus, he looked like Troye Sivan:No, I do not exaggerate.    ...and between the charm and the angelic features nobody believed that he could possibly be guilty of anything.  He was.  He was guilty of a lot of things in fact.  One of those things was attempted murder. Of me.  Which sucked.I ended up in the emergency room.  By the time they found me a bed in a womens' shelter, the police had already questioned my ex-husband once; and they were still on his trail when his mommy snuck him out of the country. While he was on a bicycle tour of Europe, then, I was back in Seattle with no money, a newborn baby on my hip, moving through a succession of battered womens shelters until I found a studio apartment that accepted AFDC tenants.  Every now and then over the next year I'd get a visit from the police asking me if I was ab-so-lute-ly certain-sure, really-fo-feely sure, now, that I wasn't just hiding him. *Why all the police interest?  You see, he was under suspicion in the Green River murders.* Yup.So when I found a recent picture of him online I was taken aback.  There he was, and he not only didn't look much the worse for wear, he looked like a kindly little old gnome. I am, however, stoked as hell that he's 1. Sixty  and 2. Balding.And that's what I get when I try and do a damn theme month.** ______________________________________________* Note:  He wasn't guilty of the Green River Murders.**The last time the police visited me I told them that if I ever saw my ex-husband again I'd be the one they'd be arresting because I'd stick a pair of scissors through the little bastards throat. And I might have been really classy about it and called them ten stacks of motherfuckers and shouted and thrown shoes, and slammed the door on them and a host of other impolitic things like that. Hey, they quit bothering me.  I ask you, though.

But I hit this... ...little bastard three times, tracking him as he scampered along the fence out back.  I REALLY DID!!!The first time I hit him he just looked at me and kept scampering. The second time I hit him he slowed his scamper and looked at me again.The third time I hit him he had stopped and was sitting up. He watched me struggle with the slide, watched me take aim, and watched as the pellet floated over, hit him square in the chest, stuck in his fur for a moment and then fell out.  UPDATE Then he scampered away.  I'll bet he was pissed.___________________________I read this:Check it out. Compiled by Mary Ann Piccard. Hm?  Coincidence? American spelling perhaps?      And it was extremely good!  Even extraordinary, given the complexity of some of these recipes.  A lot of fan-love went into this, but blessedly, not the kind of basement-dwelling fanaticism that Trekkies were known for back then.  OK FINE then and now. To continue.Because this book ranges from $50.00 to $444.00 per vintage paper copy - and let me pause here to say WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK?!?!???   ...

The squirrel paused, sat up, and watched me rack the slide. He watched me take careful aim at his little squirrely self.  Then he decided that now was not the time to be dipshitting around with my potted plants and ambled away. I sent a plastic pellet lancing toward his retreating form and hit the grass a milimeter behind his little squirrely heels.

{"title": "There Are More Tears Wept Over Answered Prayers...", "date": "Saturday, September 23, 2023", "text": "Oh, Ms. Scarlet. Ms. Scarlet. Recent polaroid.      You dear woman.  You made the mistake of wanting to know more about my study projects.Oh sweetheart....My early curiosity was sparked by my grandmother and her friends, who yarned the Summers through over jelly glasses of home-made hard cider under the apple trees, telling each other stories of the way things used to be.  I used to run at large among them, and little pitchers have big ears. I could get away with maybe two questions before I was sent off to 'Go play now', so I learned early on to keep my fat yap shut and just listen and mull it all over later.  It began my lifelong love of what's disparagingly called Microhistory - which is the history of the average person.  All events begin at the middle, kids.1. Leonardo Da VinciI have been in love with DaVinci since I was 13 and saw an exhibit of his designs when it was touring the world.  It was this one. You can turn off the sound and skip ahead to the display models. That's what lit the spark.Enjoy this southbound view of a northbound Francesco Melzi.    The fascination was instant, obsessive, and has lasted until this day. The proof is that in searching for the picture above, I was stalled for three days reading about all the recent breakthroughs made in the study of DaVinci and his work.  I spent ten hours in front of the screen and didn't even notice the time go by.My DaVinci project was my first big, organized 'formal' project; and the study of his life, work and times has lead me on a wonderful tour through the most surprising byways. Everything from flood control to controlling decomposition in a warm climate, from making gesso sottile to designing the world's longest bridge. Along the road I learned how to read Italian, (kinda) was introduced to the famous male prostitutes of Olde Florence...learned how to make cantarella...and you never know when those skills will come in handy. Particularly the cantarella.This lead to2. Albrecht Durer and the Northern Renaissance. Well, basically The Renaissance and how inspiration and learning was transmitted back and forth across Europe from the 1300's to 1519. And Albrecht Durer. Because Albrecht Durer. He breaks my heart.3, 4, 5.   Oregon History/Portland History/Milwaukie History.  Sadly not a joke.     Every word the truth.        Home of the largest dogwood tree in North America, under which my ass used to get high after a hard day at school.   ...and here it is. This is a cornus nuttalii, folks. Common Dogwood. They don't get any taller than say nine feet.  But this one?  There's a two-story house at the far bottom right of this photo for scale.  We in Milwaukie were all very proud of this glorious tree.        Being my home state, its principal city, and my hometown. Why?  Because my family were original pioneer settlers, and my immediate family used to be the caretakers of the Pioneer Cemetery in Milwaukie. We had the records that helped people locate the graves of their predecessors, and the people who came to our house to consult them told us many interesting stories of the lives and times of their dead, which to little grade school FirstNations was riveting stuff because I was a super weird kid. Much of that early history is history that my father's family helped make. Time and time again I come across the names of relatives, people I've met, places I knew, and the confirmations of stories my grandmother told. And it is absolutely wonderful to me. 7. Folktales, monsters, ghosts and UFOS and how boojum tales begin and change over time.  Slenderman is one that really caught my fancy.  I've got this fuckers' NUMBER. Mix Beetlejuice with Jack Skellington and add a whole lotta puberty with access to the internet and Slenderman is what you get. You're welcome.    My mom got me into this shit without realizing it.  At first I was drug along in the wake of her obsession with all things supernatural, and then I was drug along in the wake of her obsession with all things...more acceptably supernatural. By which I mean Christianity.  I never told her that her angle on those things and mine were wildly divergent, of course. This isn't something that I'm obsessed with (any more) but I do follow it, and have been since the 1970's.7. Bog Bodies and ancient preserved dead people.  Kind of...dead, sure, but he seems content.    I am your source for all things Tollund Man and Utzi.  I actually cried when they found that poor frozen dude, thinking of him all alone up there on the mountaintop for centuries. It still gets to me. From baby mammoths to Ancient Egypt, if it was once a living thing and is now all dried out and crunchy, or leathery and maybe slippery, or gooey, I am THERE.7.  Old cookbooks, appliances, and kitchen design. It all started with the gift of one battered glass measuring cup.Still got the fucker too.      This, somehow, gave rise to a kind of frightening obsession with all things Vintage Cooking and Kitchens. I was steadily filling my house with everything from old appliances to eggbeaters back in the late 1980s, when we were selling at swap meets. Most prominently I had vintage Foley cooking utensils all displayed on my kitchen walls.  Well over sixty different objects as I recall.  Then I finished collecting the entire Foley catalogue of kitchen gadgets and interest waned. Now I'm back in black and ready to rock, and currently reading--The Star Trek Cooking Manual, 1978  (It's fanlore-canon!)-A Bachelors Cupboard, Containing Crumbs Culled From The Cupboards Of the Great Unwedded-The Cult Of The Chafing Dish-The Fireless Cookbook, 1869-Country Commune Cooking, 1972-West Oakland Soul Food Cookbook, 1963-The Web Foot Cookbook, Portland, 1885-...and, um...five more that I just bought online. All at the same time.  And this works for me quite nicely. It's how I approach all my projects.You see, most people think like this:A flow chart. If/then, yes/no. Nice. Linear. Logical.This is how I think: A tumbleweed tornado.  Chaotic, peripatetic, eventually ends up tangled together in a solid mass and catches on fire.      And I like my tumbleweed tornado. Everything travels along wherever it will, and it all makes unforeseen connections and ends up in fascinating places until finally it becomes a giant shitpile of learning. That catches on fire.So there ya go.  I am a wild and wacky party hero.  Woo baby.Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno bids you buon giorno."},

Well done, annoying neighbor. And while I am generally a sociable and tolerant old lady, good motherfucking riddance you skanky goddamn ghetto RAT.Too harsh? NEWS- The raccoons have moved on!  Why did the raccoons move their communal outhouse, you ask?  Because the Biker took a shovel and scattered their haystack of crap out in the weeds, and kept doing that until the nasty animals got tired of anally re-establishing their shit collection and opted for other locales. Aren't you glad you know this?  Didn't you come here specifically to read about people flinging raccoon shit? I know you did. That's why I wrote about it.NEWS-I have started another study project, which makes eight now.  This study project is about old, weird, rare cookbooks. I have been online typing my fingers to the damn bone digging this stuff out; and making folders and organizing the information so that it slots in with other study projects I have going - hence my absence from your personal blogospheres.  Yes. This is what I do for fun. Obsessively.I hate to tell you how many ongoing study projects I've been pursuing. OK eight. OK fine there's one I've been engaged in for fifty-one years. Seriously. It's what I do for fun.The Internet has been my fondest dream come true. You'd be surprised at how much amazing stuff is out there is in the public domain, for FREE! - and by just how many 'public domains' there are!  Any title I might be interested in has a 90% chance of being on Hathi Trust, Internet Archive, Project Gutenberg or JSTOR - but there are thousands of other open sources! This is why another project of mine consists of amassing a folder full of those links and an explanatory blurb for each one. God I love tabulation. The worst side effect of all this study is Needing Desperately To Own Source Volumes.  There I am in front of the screen, and looky at that - there's Amazon, Ebay, Etsy, and all the other sales platforms, and me with a PayPal account. WHAM a package hits the door, and I scuttle out and grab it, unwrap it, gloat over the contents, then dispose of the wrapping in the dumpster lest the Biker see it and sigh that sigh he does.So on the one hand I'm a bitter vengeful old harridan who glories in the absence of my young, ignorant and sadly obsessed with sleaze upstairs neighbor; and on the other I am an ivory tower self-isolating nerd who loves obscure shit and is an obsessive organizer.I fart in your general direction.

Distinctly sable. That's because the Mighty Canadian Black Squirrel has been sneaking down from Canada and playing Jody here in Washington State.  The result is a rather more attractive squirrel, frankly.Here at the El Apartmento we have a particular sable squirrel that's been hand tamed by some moron and is now bold as hell.  It digs in my potted plants.  It climbs up on the barbecue and stares in at me through the patio door in an expectant manner.  It even whams its paws on the screen door, as if to say \"Bitch, where's my PEANUTS??\" Yesterday it freakin' attacked me.Well fine, it just jumped on me. Actually it was chasing another squirrel, and I happened to be walking past, and in its headlong flight it used me to ramp off of, and I screamed so loud people stopped what they were doing and stared.It just ran up into a tree and sat there looking at me.I did not appreciate this.___________________________________________I was standing in line at the checkout chatting with a couple of people. One was an older man, and the other was a billowing elderly hippie lady. And it was casual. The older man was complaining about his feet, and I drifted away the instant he mentioned going to a wound care clinic, because ew. He continued on, and as I was loading my groceries onto the belt the hippie lady was commiserating with him.  Finally she pipes up with \"Have you tried using honey?\"And I got this feeling. This 'Oh damn I know where this is headed' feeling. I'm loading food. I am organizing food. I am alphabetizing my groceries and arranging them by size, praying for that line to move ahead. PLEASE GOD.And sure enough. Out pops the inevitable.  \"Or,\" she says, \"If you don't want to use honey....do you have a dog?\"\"OH FUCK NO,\" I exclaimed aloud.I have been doing this in stores a lot lately.  Here's the thing. My grandmother was a nurse.  And this was on the frontier, in the Wild West. She was pulling arrows out of people and sewing scalps back on!  She saw some shit. She also had to keep up with all the literature or else lose her license to practice, so she did that over the years until she retired.  She knew from Joseph Lister, is what I'm saying.    All the neighborhood geriatrics would gather in her yard under the apple trees when the weather was nice, and eventually the old days would come up and people would swap stories about gory accidents, mysterious occurrences and old-time beliefs. Home remedies was a common topic, and I heard tales from those old folks that would gag a pig, although at the time I found this stuff endlessly fascinating.     The crazy things people used to believe! Things like putting hot tar on a stab wound (I always wondered who just had hot tar, you know, at hand like that.  And why so many people were getting stabbed.)  Or bundling people in wet wool blankets and forcing them to drink hot whiskey every time they ran a temperature.  The well-chewed quid was used on everything from bee stings and boils to eczema and skin cancers, and I remember my granddad chasing me around the yard with one when I ran a splinter into my hand. He of course thought this was jolly fun. I on the other hand was freaked the fuck out, this nasty grizzled old twist running at me with a big drippy quid pinched between his fingers, bellowing in Finnish. Inevitably these conversations would turn to letting the dog lick a sore.  It was Biblical, people claimed. Why, you ever seen a dog around a sore?  They're drawn to it!  They want to lick it!  They're trying to help! They're mans best friend!    Nothing!!! got my Grandmother more up in arms than this one thing. Nothing. She would rant. She would lecture! And the funny thing was that it didn't make a difference. Those people would stand their ground ferociously.  I never understood it.  If you can't trust a woman who was hardy enough to nurse people through cholera, diptheria and the Spanish Influenza, you've got to have decided to be stupid and stay stupid somewhere along the line. This is how I knew that the honey remedy would inevitably lead to the dog thing.  And this is why the bare mention of same drug a heartfelt, audible OH FUCK NO up from my very youth, right there in the middle of WinCo.______________________________________August here in Washington is the month for hornets. Around midmonth their population suddenly explodes and they come raging forth like Vandal hordes high on PCP. They chew up wood siding, tuck themselves in your laundry; I've had them land on me and then sting me for the hell of it, they've bitten bloody pieces out of the Biker, and built nests in our cars - inside, outside, hanging from the wheel well, in the door gaps, in the engine compartment - and these are daily drivers, mind! They are fat and shiny and absolutely insane, and do not give one single fuck.Years back I devised a concoction fort use as a spray-on cleaner, and it really works too. It's a mixture of three tablespoons of Dawn dishwashing liquid and 1/4 cup isopropyl alcohol in a pint of plain water, put into a spray bottle and mixed. So fine. One day a hornet got to bothering me while I was doing chores, and I turned the spray on the little fucker.DROPPED. DOWN. DEAD.Holy shit.You know how when you use a can of insecticide on hornets and it just pisses them off worse?  Not this stuff!  One squirt and they immediately stop and ponder their life choices. Give it a four-count and maybe another spray just for giggles, and they're dead. Yes I've counted. So remember that, folks.

The last trailing effects of horror death run eek tropical storm Hilary blew over last night in a light rain, and today the skies are clear and the sun is OUT.  (See, when California gets a bit of rain I can jeer since OMG get over it that's just an average day up North here - but when we get temps over 80f I am suffered to cry and scream and bitch because That's Not Fuckin' Normal.) We had a lovely blue morning, and as the day progressed, the smoke crept back, and the heat increased, and I am now distinctly uncomfortable.  I was not meant to imbibe polluted air and suffer in temperatures above 72f.  I could die. Any minute. My tits are sweaty. I am uncomfortable. Shit.So I got high as balls and went out and took some more wildflower photos up and down my street.  HA I fooled you this isn't a wildflower!  It's a Snowberry!  You can't eat them. I don't think anything eats them. I think they just fall off the bush eventually and lie on the dirt.HOOT HOOT!!  Gotcha again!! This is the fruit of the Red Elderberry. No wait it's a Hawthorne. Yeah. This is a Hawthorne.  OK it's not really a Hawthorne, it's what we call a hawthorne.  A regular hawthorne is called a myrtle, and a myrtle is called a pincherry.  This makes sense if you live here.Some tansy, also known as ragweed, that's been stunted.  You have to resort to chemical warfare on this shit to knock it back, as this has been. Once it takes root, forget it.A clover head. If so inclined, you can carefully slip one of the purple blossoms out of the cluster and sip a perfect drop of honey out of it.  I mean, not this one, right. People's dogs have been at this stuff.  It's on the side of the road here. Ew.Here we have Queen Annes' Lace at every stage of it's thang, with some purple clover in the background.  At this point I was down on one knee in the street angling my phone around trying for the perfect shot, and...people saw me.  Good thing I was blazed.  Behaving in an abberrant manner doesn't count if you're high.This is called yellow lotus, and it grows in a nice round cushion.  The crazy thing about it is that once it has sprouted, it will grow to suit its conditions exactly.  This little clump is no larger than a demitasse, and all its parts are perfectly miniature.  If the seed had landed in a more fertile location the clump would have grown to the size of a hassock, in a perfect half-sphere.  This humble little plant is a native orchid in seed - platanthera elongata.  It is EXTREMELY rare.  And it comes up in its multitudes between buildings H and G here where I live, and nowhere else.  I've looked!  A small miracle, this humble little plant with green, nondescript blossoms, ant pollinated, spread by ground nesting birds who pick at it's seeds (and live in the landscape heathers.)  This is a life- list plant for me and I was astounded to find it here!________________________________________Every single year since 1969 I have cut off the side of my pointer finger, right or left.  Every single fucking year.  And this year is no different, as I type without using my right pointer finger. I just did it, trying to cut an onion on a mandoline.  You'd think by this time I'd know how to avoid this shit but noooooo. I am truly disgusted with myself.I am so used to doing this, in fact, that I don't even freak out anymore.  I just go through the drill.  Let it bleed clean,  press it closed, open the bandaid one-handed and stretch it on, whoop whoop and done.  God I am sick of this.I don't usually use a mandoline for that exact reason.  Thing is, we finally joined the trend and bought an air fryer.Seduced by the promise of frying minus the part where the kitchen and the cook get coated with a fine mist of grease, we let this appliance into our lives and now I have to figure out how to use the damn thing.  I messed around with slices of bread and temperature settings and the timer and finally thought I was ready to make something substantial, so I went for crispy vegetable fritters. Potatoes, zuchs, carrot and onion (the villain of the piece) all cut on a mandoline, squeezed, mixed, a little seasoning, a little tempura batter, a little oil, twirled into a nest type of thing and fried.  A pain in the ass usually, given stove-top frying in hot oil during August, and messing with racks and paper towels and bowls and hot fat... but delicious nonetheless. It's what you make this time of the year when people realize they've planted too much zucchini and try to fob it off on you. I thought I was ready. I thought I had this knocked.  Right up until I slipped and lopped off a quarter of my fingertip AGAIN.  No it did not land in the food. I knew you'd wonder. I however cannot be felled by such inconsequentialities.  Tomorrow I will be air-frying like a hero, turning out tasty fritters.-Oh, and baking a nice cake too, in the oven, like a normal person.  Tomorrow is the Bikers' birthday!!!!"},

This stand was about ten feet high.   Apparently we have Luther Burbank to thank for introducing the Himalayan Blackberry strain to the U.S.  After battling these things all my life, I say Go Get Stuffed, Burbank.You know what is amazing is the sheer health of this plant.  Not a blemish, not a chewed leaf, nothing.  Of course this is why blackberry is taking over.  It'll get you before you get it.This plant has hybridized with the native strain, Rubus Ursinis, which has a fruit that is tiny and ovate. Thus, you get a berry that is wider than is long on the 'Himalaya' form, writ large.  Here's the native strain:Note the shape of the ripe fruit! This is a tiny, tiny little plant that you find winding across the forest floor, with roots that go down to China.  The vines are silver-white and act as a tripwire, scouring the ankles with hundreds of tiny, brittle needles tipped with fomic acid.  The berries are the size of a button, but they taste like concentrated honey and blackberry jam, and so you risk your ankles to get them because they are that delicious.Enough of that.  What is beautiful that you didn't think was beautiful?CORN.       More corn, with some wild amaranth-type stuff around the bottom there.OK fine here. Have some conventionally pretty flowers.Beautiful fireweed, mixed with wild grasses in plume. (Also blackberry, alders, cottonwood and Elder.)A fog of fireweed!  The same thing as willow herb, or at least in the same family of plants.  The grey slugs have gotten that sprig down bottom left there.Very difficult to see, but you'll seldom see rarer - the little yellow blossoms here are known as Jewelweed, or Noli Mi Tangere.  Noli is extremely rare to find here, particularly at sea level, as Noli prefers cold gravel bars in and along high elevation rivers and streams.   I gasped when I found this stand growing in a crook of the Sumas River.  Hanging ass-up over a bridge guardrail was as close as I could get, or else risk sinking into the mud, never to be found again.  Upper right you can see a couple of jutting pale pink blossoms of wild buckwheat, or Bistort, and along the bottom the leaves of morning glory run out into the water. The silk-fine water grasses are just exquisite.This is a much better picture of the PNW strain that I stole off the Web. You can just make out these orange highlights on the blossoms in my picture.  It's a big, fleshy blossom, very like a Scotch Broom or a snapdragon when seen head-on. Bumble bees lose their little minds over this stuff!  A lovely clump of Morning Glory not afraid of the day, growing though salt pine, a young maple, wild currant and an old apple tree. As long as it's not growing in my yard, it's pretty. ___________________________________________________________________________________SUPER SECRET SPECIAL CONTENT!!!!Now in my last 'out and about' post, I talked about wooden sidewalks.  Here's an intact set.This is what a lot of the little townships out here look like still... false-fronted buildings, and particularly the wooden sidewalks.  This place still had hitching rails, that were used! back when I first moved here and all these little bends in the road were isolated.  Nowadays, thanks to sprawl, you really have to hunt to find this kind of Wild West stuff. Of course there's a taco wagon.  There' always a taco wagon.________________________________________Now you are edified.

{"title": "The Edge of America One Cool Summer Day", "date": "Monday, August 14, 2023", "text": "These were taken on August 10th.  It was a perfect day.  It was warm enough to be comfortable yet breezy enough to be invigorating.  There was a pearly haze in the air. The sky was filled with masses of low, trailing clouds, and the humid air was full of the clay and metal smell of well water sprayed high over the ripening corn and the scent of millions of blackberries ripening. An absolutely quintessential Northwest summer day.  Wasn't that paragraph just lyrical as all get out?  Of course it was.I went out to the last gasp of the last road before the international border, where the Cascades start up suddenly from the Fraser River plateau.  I'm going to follow this road until it meanders out to its end.Heading East.  This is what constitutes the last bridge over the Sumas River before it runs into Canada, which is over about an acre to the left.  Turning to the right and hanging over the guardrail, we see the Sumas River (or at least one branch of it) as it runs beneath that bridge.  This is called Saar Creek depending on what time of the year it is and how hard it's been raining.  It's three inches deep and narrow enough to step across here.  The bed lies on the blue clay layer this whole valley floats atop. You can make it out through the crystal clear water. It actually is bluish.This is where the Cascades begin.  Imagine the aroma of all this ripening fodder, the corn growing, and the smell of the evergreens coming down out of those hills.  It was amazing.  I could have stayed out here all day.   I've come out here in the past and seen herds of deer going up the rocky sides of this mountain in broad daylight.  I'd hoped to see them today.  The deer had other plans. Oh well.Nearing the end of the road now...The blue flowers are chicory, also called Bachelor's Buttons, that have been mowed. Usually they stand about two feet high.Up past the last curve, to find a curious horse!  I am using all the zoom here because horses kind of freak me out, although this one seemed very chill.This is it.  From here you walk.  Where to?  North across the border to a very, very small town called Arnold, or straight up East into the Mt. Baker National Forest where a bear will eat you. Or back South across the farmland until a cow eats you. Now let's turn our backs on this and head back in to Sumas City Limits!  Hooray!Here we are, just past the city limits sign, standing on the bridge over the mighty Sumas River! The river that killed a town! Oh shit it's the Sumas River bridge!  What dire peril awaits below this span???What scene of death and tragedy?  What swift, gnashing waters running white maned o'er jagged, merciless rocks??!  WHAT SCENE OF WRECKAGE AND HEARTBREAK???HOLY SHIT IT'S THE RIVER THAT KILLED A TOWN!!!!!    To me - and I've mentioned this before - this is a creek.  In fact it doesn't even rate the name 'creek' - it's a rill. A trickle. A seep.  And this is what it usually looks like, Spring, Summer and Fall.  In the Winter it might fill this swale until the water reaches four feet across......when it can find the damn swale at all.  I've only turned to the left slightly, and the river, such as it is, has been completely obscured by this carpet of morning glories.  Here's a close-up of that house.  A year ago, all this had been washed away, right back to the foundations.  All that has been replaced and shored back up. Look how fast the plants have taken back over!The morning glories are even clambering up the bridge!  (I've turned my back on the house and now am looking back toward the Rancho just past the speed limit sign.)Of course I had to visit the old place.    I absolutely love this shot.  Neglect never looked so good.  Man, that moody sky and the full, gorgeous greens here... this may be my favorite. It absolutely captures what I love about this time of year, and about the Northwest.    HOLY BATCRAP THAT WAS SO FUN OMG WTF BBQ LET'S DO THAT AGAIN ok fine we will._________________________________  Next post:  !!!Super fantastic wildflowers!!!!"},

I know.It is downright comfortable out!  And sunny! People are out actually doing things besides going to brew pubs.  They're having garage sales and letting the kids stay up and splash in the sprinklers, walking dogs, working in their yards, visiting up and down the street.  And I have been out among them!It has been so temperate, in fact, that the local blackberries have come on like monsters, growing out over the street overnight in some places. It makes me homesick for Oregon, where the blackberry patches ruled. They got so big you could walk underneath them!  As kids we'd take in a broomhandle and rattle it up above in the canopy and the blackberries would tumble down, all warm from the sunshine above. This was more fun if you were four feet tall and didn't mind being covered in splattered blackberries, of course.I live on a bluff overlooking Puget Sound, and every bird in creation has been planting blackberries on the edge of that bluff since the first Native American chased a wooly mammoth here.  So off I went - less than a mile away! - and picked a gallon or more of blackberries yesterday.   It only took me twenty minutes to fill the bucket!  And all the while I had a beautiful view of the estuary of the Nooksack River going out into Puget Sound, the emerald green marshes and all the lacy creeks and rills running through it and out across the tidelands toward the bay. I spent more time examining bumblebees and watching herons fly across the water below than I did picking berries, naturally.Long story short, made a blackberry pie, and four blackberry tarts!  But I had blackberries left over.  Hmm.  So I tinted an old white t-shirt with them.Now I'm going to dye my hair. With blackberries.  Yup.________________________________________GOOBER GRAPE (that's what they'll be calling me)I cannot believe people actually used to eat this. Stripes of grape jelly and stripes of peanut butter running lengthwise was squirted into the jar, and made for a novel sight on the grocery shelf . But when you'd go to kids houses and they'd offer you some, the whole inside of the jar had already been shlorped around with a butterknife and looked like a horrible catastrophe had happened and all the peanut people were dissolving from a purple disease. When the going gets tough, God makes you eat stuff like peanut butter and grape jelly or perhaps sauerkraut that's full of caraway seeds, and you have to tough that out.  If you don't, you won't go to Heaven. At least not the good Heaven.  You'll have to go to Bargain Heaven and you don't get wings there. You get a scooter.______________________________________I DID NOT DYE MY HAIR WITH BLACKBERRIES SO HAI was too busy drinking animal beer in the sauna.     See, I was smart for once. I've gone pure white at the temples, like a Horror Host, which I adore.  I left well enough alone - and do not want a bright purple scalp.  No.  Tempting as that sounds.The t-shirt was more than enough warning.  A once-white shirt went from a deep red-purple, before washing, to something you'd find in a shallow grave in the woods. This is how you get impregnated by a ghost, I'm pretty sure.Not only did it turn myn shirt wet newspaper grey, it picked up ever hidden stain and just sank its teeth in.  I had no idea my detergent was that shitty! So that's something I learned - switch to a better brand.Yes it's been a hectic swing through space and time here at the el Apartmento. Whatchooz been doing, dime?"},

It's true!  The Biker works for a place that designs and manufactures pizza ovens for the worldwide market, and it has an amazing test kitchen where the new designs are tried out, and where chefs come and test out their new recipes prior to releasing new pizzas on an unsuspecting world.  The results are given to the employees to assess.

Fact or fiction?  I grew up on radioactive milk and Velveeta.  Therefore, the authenticity of any given pizza, as far as my ass is concerned, is determined by whether or not you can see it's reflection in a mirror, like Dracula, or Joe Biden. ...because he's so old. So, like, he's probably Dracula, because he's...I know what I mean. This thing pictured below is the Pizza Hut Hotdog Bites Pizza, the pizza Joe Biden eats every day.  He tears this shit up.

It's for you, Mr. President!\"  \"Fuck off , I'm swimming in pizza and you wish you were me.\"  That's what he says.  _______________________________   I'm Thinking About Pizza Too MuchYears and years ago there was a pizza chain called Shakey's here in the PNW.  The one we went to on Foster and Powell was decorated in Murder Basement Noir, with a low ceiling, dim lighting, walls that were thick with cobwebs, and massive benches where you sat like a galley slave and waited. And waited.Naturally, the pizza blew.I mean the pizza really blew. Grease pooled on the surface and shimmered in the cups of charred pepperoni; bright orange grease that would run down your arm and harden on the tray as you ate.  I ate a slice once when I was six, and puked on the floor next to the table, and in the car all the way home, and in the bathroom when I got home, and then they gave me Seven-Up and I barfed that, which wasn't too bad, and it wasn't orange either.  _________________________________________A Pizza RevolutionTen years earlier, a pizza revolution had already taken place in Portland, Oregon, in the form of Francines Pizza Jungle!  Who knew? __This chick is not Francine, but she's probably 70 now.______________________________________Meanwhile, little FirstNations (not her above) was growing up, and her local pizzeria hangout was the locally notorious Pietros.  They hired staff exclusively from my high school. That's why I refused to eat there.  I knew those people. The only safe menu item there was the pop. Even then you had to lie to yourself.It took me years to figure out that this was supposed to represent a tall, skinny chef muffled up in kitchen whites. Imagine me in elephant bells, ice cream shoes and a crop top smoking a joint out front here in 1975. Or not. I am not the boss of you.Pietros was a theme pizzeria, and the theme was 'Wipe your hands on our red-flocked wallpaper'. For unknown reasons, the owners attempted and failed to imitate a Gay Nineties look. See me, I'da gone for the Italian thingamaroo but that' just me.

Dangling from the pull chain to the light over our washing machine was a devotional scapular of St. FrancisLike this only older and dirtier     ...which my mother might have worn. (She never said, and I didn't ask. I just dicked with it until the string broke, and then put it in the washer, and it got washed, and it shrunk.)Mom was a walking library on things like the Stigmata, which is probably why she liked St. Francis, who was poked full of holes;  the Lactation of St. Benedict...Yup. Just....yup.   ...weeping statues, bleeding paintings, weeping crucifixes, weeping and bleeding statues, crucifixes and paintings, The Devils Nun, (also comprehensively perforated, poor woman) and other mysteries of Catholicism that involved the secretion of fluids for no good reason. That's why she was one of the early devotees of Padre Pio. Padre Pio was a priest who had been granted the Holy Stigmata.  Starring Shia LaBoeff.  No shit. I'm not even Catholic anymore and I'm ashamed.   This dude was the whole enchilada. He had the the Marks of the Scourge, the Mark of the Holy Cross, the Scars of the Crown of Thorns, the Wound of Longinus, and the Wounds of the Nails.  No, not Shia LaBoeff. Padre Pio. Keep up.No,w bleeding and crying and secreting scented oils are not strictly the domain of Catholics and their belongings.  My grandmother told a story of a tintype of the deceased that wept.  And that sounds like a typical florid Victorian notion, doesn't it? Ghoulish and romantic at the same time, with a little folklore thrown in.Thinking about this, I remembered a story I'd read in Easyriders Magazine (it could have been another publication. It was awhile ago.)  It was the story of the painting of Lovely Larry, which I thought was the original of a poster that was pretty popular in the late 1960s, which I cannot find to save my life, although I've come close.OK. See the guy in the middle with the helmet, round glasses and striped shirt?  That dude was the only image on the poster, which I remember seeing for sale in 1968-71.  Can't find it for sour birdshit nowadays, though.  And it's not Lovely Larry. It's Frank Sedilek. This whole line of thought makes sense to me.  The story goes, LL's wrecked motorcycle had gotten lost after his death.  One of the ol' ladies was a bruja, and she said that she had spirit guidance from LL telling her the location of the motorcycle and hoping that it would be repaired and run again - and sure enough, she was right! There it was in some random dudes' hall closet.  It was brought out and re-built...and on that very day, the painting of Lovely Larry in the Hells Angels clubhouse had tears running down its face.I looked up bleeding paintings, because why the hell not.  And by gosh I found a weeping painting. Of Willie Nelson.Our Willie Nelson painting is bleeding. Haunted or nah? #scary #haunte... | TikTokOddly, it's on Japanese TikTok. I have no idea why Japanese people would be interested in a crying picture of Willie Nelson but there you go.  -I also found the story of a bacterium that can produce bleeding polenta.  BLEEDING FREAKIN' POLENTA PEOPLE. Can you imagine? You want to have a nice polenta and Oh Damn No That Shit Is Bleeding.-The UK gives us this little menace:  The Inflammable Crying Boy. Which as far as I'm concerned is a sight better, artistically speaking, than a Keene Crying Kid picture.

She had a roomful of the things     Anyway, back to the UK crying boy picture.   Apparently if you have this thing hanging on the wall your house will burn down, and only this mysterious picture of the Crying Boy will remain, undamaged amid the smoking pyre of your former belongings.  So, like, Jon?  You and Arcati sweep the premises, OK? If you find one of these fuckin' things, GET RID OF IT.- All over ancient Greece and Rome were statues that rambled around, made faces, wept, bled, spoke, and sweated. And nobody thought a thing of it. Apparently, that's what statues did, and you put up with it.  (I for one would be kind of grossed out by a sweaty statue.  I'd go next door to visit the one that wasn't sweaty.)  The statue of Apollo at Cumae cried a lot. You had to kill and animal and take a good look at it's liver to find out why.Not like you'd know it from this happy scamp.  Of course he was holding a spear originally, so maybe he was happy about whatever he was about to stab. Or maybe he was going to test a cake for doneness. I don't know.  What I do know is Apollo loves to run around with his junk hanging out, which seems like it would have been distracting.-Well what do you know. There is a statue of Buddha that moves and blinks and stuff. This guy is super excited about it.I figured the Buddha for a contemplative kind of fellow. Apparently he likes to mess with his followers occasionally. Quelle surprise.-In Atlanta, there is a freakin' Bleeding House.  Naturally, they tell you about all the photographs of the place with blood all over, geysering from the bathroom floor, running down the walls, just a mess - but do they show them?  NO.  Of course they don't.I really hate this.  Always you hear about photographs taken of the really good places, like the Snedeker House for example, and yet nobody ever pops up with the things. And that Snedeker house, man, everything was going on there, from poltergeist activity, to a little ghost boy running around in Batman pajamas, to acts of sodomy performed by a pterodactyl-demon, which I for one would definitely have tried to catch on film. John Zaffis (paranormal investigator, on hand at the Snedeker house, along with his aunt and uncle Ed and Elaine Warren) even says there's pictures - and video! DAMMIT ZAFFIS PUBLISH THEM ALREADY or don't you have bills to pay? Shit or get off the paranormal pot already.The book about this haunting, In A Dark Place, is pretty thrilling.  However, I have the same problem with the story that reviewer Michael from Goodreads has:\"And that's my problem with stories like these, of which I've read hundreds: no one ever seems to suspect that something supernatural is occurring until far too late. Seriously: I'd hear a menacing, disembodied voice exactly one time before I'd think, \"Hmmm...I live in a funeral home. There are cold spots. It feels clammy. It's always dim. Maybe, just maybe...\" The other thing I found frustrating was the family's seeming inability to tell each other what was taking place. Again, if our bed was vibrating, and Julie (my wife) was hearing tinny music, laughing voices, and footsteps moving through our hallway, I suspect she might mention it to me. Like, at the top of her voice the instant it happened. And—this is just me; not to be judgmental or anything—were I sodomized by a demon, I wouldn’t then worry about how expensive moving is. It would become a bit of a priority in my life to, you know, leave. Right. Then.\"Well, that rounds it up.  What you need to take away from this is that there may or may not be inanimate objects out there that scream, pee, write bad checks and drive fast cars. You never know. Check your sofa. See if it screams.AND HAVE YOUR CAMERA ON HAND DAMMIT."},
{"title": "My Cat Rosie", "date": "Thursday, July 20, 2023", "text": "On my perambulations around the Web I found a forum full of answers to the question \"What's the stupidest amount of money you ever spent on a pet, that turned out to be nonsense?\"It's story time._____________________   It was my first apartment, and I had just gotten rid of my first roommate, a girl who had been pitched to me by my mother's Bible group.  ...yeah.  Naturally this girl turned out to be a twitchy, spooky suicidal-depressive who lived in constant fear that someone would come in through her bedroom window and kill her cat. Where she got this from I do not know, but she would work herself into fits of trembling every evening and rant about how she just knew someone was going to break in specifically to kill her cat. After two weeks she was calling home all the time sobbing, begging her parents to let her move back in, something that they seemed...oddly reluctant to do.Finally, to my great relief, they relented.  Her father quietly apologized to me and explained how things were on his last trip in for her stuff.  And I forgave him. He seemed really stressed.  At the same time, I was happy to see her ass go down the road, so I didn't keep him chatting.I did not miss her, and to this day I don't remember her name - but I did miss her cat.  I liked her cat. One of the reasons why I liked her cat was because her cat did not regale me with detailed descriptions of its suicide attempts. Unlike it's owner. ...yeah.Two weeks later I was out at the curb putting trash into the dumpster.  There underneath, crying, was a young Siamese cat.  It was starving and dirty, and had a horribly sunken eye.  No thought was involved.  I was going to save this cat. I fed it, got it cleaned up, and took it in to the vets. On the bus. Wrapped in a sweater.And I did it in menswear.     $300.47 (in today's money) later, I had a freaked out young Siamese cat, less one brain tumor and its little kitty uterus.  The vet gave me a cardboard carrier for her.  I caught the bus home.  By the time I made it back, that carrier was shredded, and all that whole long, long way, stoplight to stoplight, that cat screamed it's Litany of  Murder.  I lunged off the bus at my stop, followed by laughter.Things went happily uphill from there. Soon she was a nice, happy, shiny cat that I adored and that adored me, too. I decided to name my kitty 'Rosie Planetoid' because I was 18.  Rosie quickly grew from a petite, rangy kitty into a hulking Neanderthal bruiser, all beetling brow, wide jaws and broad chest, the weirdest cat I've ever seen, even to this day. People began calling her the Flintstones cat.  She adored my friends, probably because they reeked of pot, and would cuddle them whenever they came over, and she got petted and made over by everyone.   They would bring her A&W Baby Burgers, just to watch her snack them down in two gulps. Like I said, this was a big, hulking cat. Rosie was a sweetheart. She liked to follow me around the house and watch me do things.  She slept on the side of my bed, and she liked to snuggle and play and make comments about daily life.  She liked to take a turn around out of doors too, to go beat up the neighborhood cats.  Dogs, too. And she would bring me presents, as cats will. The ass is the best part! I saved it for you!  But where other cats bring their owners things like dead mice, Rosie would climb on top of the dumpster, throw back the metal lid with one mighty paw, and fetch me back whole cracked crabs, leftover baked potatoes still in their tinfoil complete with butter and chives, and congealed lumps of spaghetti.  \"Your cat's out shopping again,\" one of my friends would say, hearing the dumpster lid bang off the side.  And sure enough, there she'd be on the front step a few moments later with a dead plant.  Or a half a hot dog, complete with bun and mustard.Because I'm mom's special cat.   One day I was breaking down a pound of bud and weighing up bags on the triple beam, watching Sesame Street, high as balls. Rosie the cat came up on the back of the couch where I was sitting and draped herself over my shoulder.  I turned my head and felt something weird in her side.  Huh.I lifted her off my shoulder and laid her on the couch and began feeling around.  I found what I hoped I would not find - a definite lump way back in her abdomen.  I remembered the horrible brain tumor the vet had removed from behind her eye, and I FREAKED.By this time I had a regular cat carrier.  Once again I took my cat aboard the bus, and once again my nice kitty transformed into a thing from Hell, screaming, bashing around inside the carrier, reaching out the air holes, snagging a womans coat sleeve.  After three blocks the whole bus had gone silent. All you could hear were the baritone howls coming from my enraged cat, all the long, long way from 52nd and Powell to 4th.I checked in at the vets.  The place was jammed. Little kids were playing. People were chatting about their pets. Dogs were whimpering.  I sat there holding a small box full of a large puma for all that anyone could tell by the sound.  As bad as the bus ride had been, this was worse. This cat was now making sounds never heard on Earth.  \"What have you got in there?\" asked the man next to me. He had a cat too.  His cat was silent.  \"A cat,\" I said. \"Sounds angry,\" said he. At the time the phrase 'No shit, Sherlock' had not come into usage.  So I said \"No shit, buddy.\" And he shut up.Finally the nurse called us in.The vet came into the exam room, took my story, and gave my cat an examination.  It took three nurses to hold that cat down, and finally the vet had them put her into a special immobilization thing like a cat-straitjacket, and still that animal fought and howled.  I could hear people outside the room going 'Listen to that animal!' and 'What is it, a bobcat?'  And I'm crying, thinking my poor cat has cancer and is in terrible pain.\"Well, you'll be relieved to hear there's nothing wrong!\" said the vet.  \"She's fine!\"What was the problem, you ask?My cat had to take a dump.I paid $200.00 to find out my special, special cat was full of shit."},
{"title": "Saddle Up Podner", "date": "Monday, July 17, 2023", "text": "Long, long ago when I was but a wee FirstNative, there was a show on television called Hee Haw.  Every adult I knew LOVED this show.  It consisted of regional white stereotypes...holler dwellers, hicks, hayseeds, rubes and village idiots, all twanging to beat the band and singing Bluegrass, Country Western, Country Pop and Grand Ole Opry classics.  Nine-year-old me thought it was a mega cringefest from the first opening notes of it's theme song:I am so sorry to have done this to you. Now to be perfectly honest, there were a lot of excellent musicians on this show.  It was the premise and the format that was so awful. Of course, it was typical mainstream 1960's fare too. I guess people gotta get paid. Hee Haw went off the air in 1992, but its memory lingers on.  One man living in Hinotes Corner, Washington U.S.A built himself an entire shrine dedicated to the show.  It resides in a restaurant called The Rusty Wagon, and it was created with the help of a local chainsaw artist.  It used to be that the entire place was Hee-Haw themed, but now it's relegated to part of the main dining room. And so as not to draw out the tension - because I know y'all are slavering - here you go: Here we are walking up to one of the most popular and longstanding restaurants in Whatcom County.  Yes it has a fake outhouse out front.  I spared you the cute motto above the door, and you are grateful.  Just hang on.  You'll get your cute motto fix.   Right next to the front door.  Is this meant to be 'theme'? Yes. Is it meant to be ironic? ....maybe...maybe not. If you want to see open carry anywhere in Whatcom County, you'll see it here on a Sunday morning.  Right after church.  No kidding.   The next few pictures are taken inside the Hee Haw dining room.  I had to 'Skip To My Lou' right purdy so as not to bother the diners with my picture taking!    Kids, I won't lie.  The one thing I enjoyed about 'Hee Haw' was Grandpa Jones picking.  That man was amazing.This is the backdrop to the stage.  They have live music here on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. No I do not attend.  Someone might ask me to dance. I do not dance.The stage.  Behind the glass you can barely see Rooster Cogburn aka John Wayne peeking out. Hi John!Good old Minnie Pearl.  HOOOOOOOOOOOOOW - DEE!    OK.  Now we're going to take a little trip around the rest of the place.For a Western Themed restaurant, this is pretty restrained.  And yes - there on the dividing wall is The Rusty Wagon swag shelf!  On the other side of it is one of the last remaining salad bars in the wild. (Covid killed the rest.) No I didn't take a picture of it.  It's a salad bar. C'mon.   This is the hostess station.  If you can make it past the zombie (center bottom) you're good to go.Horse Advice.  Miss Rodeo America was a local girl back inn 2013.The vestibule again.  Left bottom there you can see a poster up for the Deming Logging Show.  (That would be the subject of a whole 'nother post.)  A logging show is an amazing thing to see, and all the competitors are local. They have events like spike climbing, log rolling, competitive chainsaw...sawing, customized chainsaw races (!!!), and other loggerly events.   There are men and women out here that can throw hatchets and axes with deadly accuracy, in case you were feeling frisky.  The notice board.  Every good local restaurant has one of these the further you go toward Mt. Baker. They really are the heartbeat of a small town. Back when we had our motorcycle paint and custom business we got a lot of work using local notice boards just like this one (and that's how we flew without a business license for so many years!)Not a prob.  -oh damn I gotta take a leak!  Well let's go find the bathroom.Oh! It must be down this way! Thanks, Speedy!  Ah. This must be the place.Yup, this is definitely the place.Well, that's enough of that.  Yeah, I feel snarky about this place, but here's the thing - their food is FANTASTIC, the service is great, and the place is always sparkling clean. You have to give credit where credit is due. We've been here a handful of times over the past 30 years. Of course, one doesn't always feel like being surrounded by tchotkes, racism and Red politics being shouted across the room, so we don't feel like we need to visit at all these days.Here's my question for you folks from Parts Foreign; and this is something I've always wondered.  Do  you have private-owned theme restaurants like this where you live, or is that an American thing?"},

I had to face the reality, and I got through it just fine - with a little help from The Angiosperms! YEAAAAAAAAAH WE'RE THE ANGIOSPERMS!  YEAAAAAAAAAH WE'RE THE ANGIOSPERMS!  WE'LL SAVE YOU FROM STUFF WITH OUR HAIR!   (Meet The Angiosperms 1972 Arista Records)Here we have a picture of Rancho FirstNations two years ago in June:Here's a picture of the Rancho today:Yup, it's abandoned.  Here's what happened.  We sold out to a local man who was keen on taking advantage of the situation created by the flood, acquiring local properties fast and cheap.  Mere weeks after we cleared out, we pulled the trigger.  We got cash on the barrelhead, done deal, and made a modest profit, feeling lucky to have gotten out from under.  About three months after the sale was final, the State and the Feds changed all the flood zone definitions in Sumas and upgraded the development regulations - and now the poor dude can't do a thing with the place.  It would simply cost too much any way he might want to jump - he can't even afford to tear it down! so he's stuck.  But since the property is within city limits he has to keep up the lot or get fined, so he sends in guys to hack everything back.  As you can see, they do 'hacking back' thoroughly and well.Try as they might, though, you can't keep a good rose down!Utterly indifferent to all the spilled diesel fuel, asbestos, cess pit effluvia and other nightmare substances that now lay on this valley like leprosy, THIS ROSE LAUGHS!I lead off with 'Munstead Wood', the queen of my heart.  There it was, smelling like heaven, making bees happy, a huge umbrella of a plant.  Man, I felt proud.I also felt hurried because I was trespassing, so I had to do a speed run through the place; hence the lack of more and better snaps.Here's a landscape rose I bought. I forget the name. It's just a Star Rose.  But I mean look at this thing:It's clean as a hound's tooth, too.  All these roses are! Thriving on neglect.  Not a bug. Glorious new growth. Celine Brunner, the frowsy old harridan, living her best life, coming down off the first flush of May.  Check out those leaves!Here's one I never expected to make it. Not in a million years. It was cranky, it was whiny, it was a heavy feeder, the bugs adored it; and look at the goddamn thing now.  This is Jackson and Perkins 'Fourth of July'.Here's another picture of it because it just blew me away.  There's some nice dead canes sticking up, but I'd be surprised if there wasn't on this bastard. Best striped rose on the market IMHO.  Hardy, too!  You see the proof!Even this bugger!  I bought this rose as a band! It cost me a buck at K-Mart!  Yeah, the pieris to the left is a dead duck, but this damn thing lived!And here's the star of the Survival Show:Improved Josephs Coat!    I will never stop singing the praises of this rose.  This plant stopped and held a full-sized floating steel dumpster during the flood! It was knocked halfway to the ground, half-covered in flood-wrack, and all the branches were broken! It's been backed over! There's a two-foot hole right next to the roots where someone dug up the Itoh Red peony, it's had no care whatsoever and the fucker is blooming!There are buds on it!  This is all new growth!      Many of the perennials are coming up and are ready to blaze. It's going to be a colorful abandoned property, that's for sure, and I hope people come by and steal more plants. I'm going to pat myself on the back here.  I damn well knew how to choose and where to plant.  I knew what the hell I was doing."},
{"title": "I Dreamed I Had A Heart Attack In My Maidenform Bra", "date": "Tuesday, July 4, 2023", "text": "I thought I had a heart attack yesterday.  It was a lovely, warm, calm day.  I was sitting at the table and had just tucked in to a nice bowl of Japanese soup when out of nowhere, a headache began in the middle of my brain, expanded and swelled and got worse and worse and worse until I thought my skull would explode. It happened just as fast as it takes to read that sentence. I got nauseous and short of breath, and came over all clammy.  Chest pain. Tingling hands. I went from feeling as good as I've ever felt in my life to AGONY in three seconds.  It continues to wax and wane after the initial blast, too. I could not have made a phone call, driven a car, or walked to the front door.In case I've not made my point clearly enough, here is a visual aid.   I was still going \"Why? Huh? What?\" when the Biker calmly took me to the emergency room.After ex-rays, cardiograms and a couple of brain scans, I found out:  I was fine. The cardiologist told me that I have the heart and circulatory system of an 18 year old kid (insert 'crawlspace' or 'trunk of my car' joke here) and oddly, my brain scans were 100% normal.  I expected to see weird things, like maybe a pool toy or something. But no.  No sign of an aneurism or an impending aneruism, no alien implants.  And by this time, I was feeling fiiiiiiiine. A little hungry. A little sheepish. The pain had just faded away on it's own. It took about an hour and a half.Apparently I had a Cluster Headache.  I was given a medication to take if I feel another one coming on, and now I have to go and do a bunch of tests to check all the other things that might be the problem, which really irritates me, but is better than having my head explode and far less of a pain to clean up after, I guess.The reason this even merits a post is because I had no problems whatsoever up at the hospital.  None. It was fast and professional.  The place was a war zone after Covid; now the whole place has been cleaned, repaired, updated and streamlined.  The staff seemed upbeat, not the downtrodden, resentful drudges I remember. It's not the same St. Joe's that I used to fear, and that is A Very Good Thing. Good health care still happens in America. It looks like I won't be dying of a heart attack or an aneurism anytime soon, either. Cool."},
{"title": "Hardcore America Happening Here", "date": "Saturday, July 1, 2023", "text": "This guy here vvv is a North County legend.He lives right on the bank of the river in Everson, about 150 feet from where the bridge washed out and the river broke through and flooded the lowlands. As you can see he lives below grade.  He had to be evacuated from the floodwaters in the bucket of a tractor, in fact.  But not to blame any de-funding of public works and services by his hero, no siree. He is holding that line. One of many, many American flags - flown at half mast!  What a prick! - on this dude's property is visible just peeking out of the hedge upper center.  He also flies a 'TRUMP WON I know it - You know it' flag.  As must come as a complete surprise, I know.   This sign went up during the first election, and has remained in place, being vandalized, getting run over, being kicked to pieces, being set on freakin' fire - and getting repainted, repaired, re-dated and rebuilt - ever since.  This latest iteration?  Is made of steel I-beams set into concrete, and the signboard two pieces of metal sandwiched over a slab of cement.  He hadn't quite gotten around to doing something about this most recent act of improvement vandalism, but give his ass time.  Promulgating all this ignorance is a big responsibility.Now here we are in Hinotes Corner:This is out in front of the American Legion post in Hinotes' Corners.  This is how you appropriately dispose of a worn out, damaged American flag - you take it to an American Legion hall and either hand it to a Legionnaire or put it in their drop box.What do they do with the flags?  They incinerate them in Flag Disposal ceremonies held on Flag Day (June 14th).  When I was a kid they used to hold the ceremony at the cemetery where we were the caretakers, and they made real sure those flags were all the way gone, dumping on gallon after gallon of gasoline. They'd play 'Taps' and had an armed Honor Guard and everything.  It was a trip.  For all I know now one of the guys just takes them all home and puts them in his woodstove, but hey, you got a free childhood story out of me and it wasn't depressing!We're in a little area called Ten Mile here, and underneath the siding of this nice little house is a foursquare log cabin, the Original Home and Homestead Property of the very first Bikers in America. (They were little tiny weird-looking people too.) This place is so old that the local Nooksack tribe used to attack it all the time and burn the barn down. Washington wasn't even a state then.  America was just a distant clusterfuck East of the Mississippi.  See, the Bikers came early, and they came around Cape Horn onboard ship, because that's just how badass they were. None of this ox-driven, wagon train 'crapping on the prairie' nonsense for them....and this very lamp is one of the things they bought for their nice new cabin.  Yup.   Within the old limits of what was the town of Laurel is this off-the-grid family and their roadside honor produce stand.  Give it another month and there'll be product on the shelves and cars parked up and down both sides of the road.  Once I stopped the engine, all I could hear was bees buzzing around the hives they keep up the lane, birds chirping, and the wind. So, so nice.  It's worth clicking on to get the full effect here.  Down just above the sign that says 'YUM YUM\" there is a little oblong yellow box.  That's how you pay. Something costs a dollar?  You fold up the dollar and stick it in the slot. The container is made of steel square stock and has a lock on it.  Or...  ...you can pay like this.  Digital hippies! Ecotopia!  The future is now!   Out in an area called Fazon is a place by the side of the road that sells chainsaw carvings.  Starting back almost thirty years ago the guy did a banging business every summer selling stuff that looked like this:  He'd sit out by the road with a little handheld landscape chainsaw and zip stuff like this out all day long.  He had about ten different sizes of saw he'd use. We'd stop after fishing on Fazon Lake and watch the dude. He'd take a whole telephone pole-sized log and zip out a Christian Warrior, a black bear or a Paul Bunyan in fifteen minutes and sell it to someone driving by.  Sadly (or not, depending on your taste in chainsaw carvings) the only place the guys' work survives is inside one specific restaurant, where the above ^^^ charming scene greets the eye, because he used crappy-grade lumber, so all the outdoor stuff melted in the rain and got ate by termites.Never a hoplite, the Christian Warrior chainsaw statue is usually an Arthurian knight with the above attributes, about nine feet high, that you stick next to your driveway so people can find your house.  Now imagine that in the style above.  Just to impress this point upon your mind, review this style NOW:...and apply it to a nine-foot-tall Arthurian knight with the words 'Helm of Salvation' on its helmet and 'Sheild of Faith' on its shield, and...Well, that guy died about seven years ago, and his son took over the business.  Now the lot looks like this:As you can see, chainsaw carving has changed A Lot.  You want Mojo Jojo, a Ninja Turtle or Boba Fett out next to the driveway so people can find your house?  You can do that now in Whatcom County.Being able to find your driveway is a real thing out here, particularly when the weather sucks. There's no streetlights and lots of tall trees. I had my driveway planting, for example. There were white rocks on the street side, and it was easy to locate during a heavy fog.Some people have sign boards.  Here's one:An expression of unity out by Smith Grange. The folks who live here are also off the grid. See the solar cells in the background?  That's for their grow-op.  They wholesale to a local pot shop and do custom pre-rolls and edibles.  They happen to supply my pot shop, in fact. Rock on.A lineman lives here and wants you to know it, with his yellow hard hat and half a cut-off phone pole.   I am not going to scratch out the addos because you have no idea where this is or if I stole it off the Web or what.Same idea at work out near Custer, only this time, someone had a maple tree blow down. (I remember when this happened, and this is the story.) Well, they said, let's chop up the smaller stuff for firewood, but take that one big section of log and let's carve a black bear out of it and set it next to the road so people can find our house.  And they did.  So do a lot of people. In fact your grandpa will be glad to make you one for a wedding present. Chainsaw carvings of black bear for your new home are a popular in-law or grandparent wedding gift.  'Here. Have a wood bear. It's for your driveway. See I put a hole so where he can hold a flag.  It's so you can find your house.'  Some people prefer Paul Bunyan, and some prefer The Christian Warrior, or an American Eagle. I've also seen a seven foot tall salmon. Totem poles are only for public buildings and casinos.  Or set back next to your house. Never on the road.  They get stolen and sold for big bucks to people who think that Real Indians carved them.  God I wish I were exaggerating. Here by Greenwood now.  Animal lovers and vegetarians, avert your eyes:These are veal pens, children.  Despite what some  may say.   Yes, this is how replacement stock begins life on a large dairy farm, but see...this isn't a dairy operation.  We are deep in the heart of locker beef country, here.  And even that being the case, these pens are way, way, way back along the river on an unimproved county road, because you don't go market-raising bob calves out where PETA can see you from the street. (The link goes to one of the more florid anti-veal sites.) This is the flipside of dairying. You have to keep the gals freshened, and that means cow sex and eventually, calves.  You can't use all those calves for replacement stock, and half of them will be male, so you either - you know, let's leave it at veal pens. Note:  Until today I thought the plural of calf was calfs. Now to me 'calves' sounds gross, but I am willing to suffer for the sake of your reading pleasure. I'll still say 'calfs' though. Here we are on Front Street in Lynden, where we see a sideways...  I know the Garden Club uses the understructure to make a Christmas Tree display, so this would be hanging baskets all arranged to make a cascading...Springmas Tree?  Yeah, a Springmas Tree I guess.  This is actually a lovely idea, and when the understructure had been kept in good repair, the stray bicycles have been returned to the dump, the groundcover has been chosen with taste and it's been planted correctly, the flowers cascade down to the ground and ripple gracefully in the breeze.  It looks like a fountain of blossoms and is extremely pretty. Unfortunately, it became the pet planting of one particular Garden Club woman who appointed herself Me Only Pirate Queen of the Flower Fountain! Wavin' 'er Cutlass!  Repelling All Boarders! MY FLOWER FOUNTAIN!  ARRRRRR!' and you see it now. She owns a local women's finer resale shop and she is A Damn Trial.  Stuff like this is why I turned down all the invites I used to get to join their Garden Club.  And also why I don't shop at her store anymore.I was going through Northwood when I saw a Barn Sale sign. Screeeech!    As you can see, there are no barns for sale.  It's not even IN a barn.  It's in a metal machine shed. Everything here is from the 1980's.  And pigeons have been shitting on it.If you click and look out the back doors, you'll see that this machine shed out in the middle of East Medieval Bumfuck Egypt backs on a soulless condominium development that disappears into a dystopian haze of identical buildings.OOO here it is.    There was one treasure, though.    It's a headless mannequin missing it's arms, dude.       I had to pass up this addition to my modern lifestyle, and I was bummed too.  I came very close to dragging this home.  What would I have done with it?  Not a fuck of a lot; it's a headless mannequin missing its arms, dude. The options are limited. Still. Now I'm going to leave you with a teaser.  A little something to look forward to.  A little something from Munstead Wood.You're gonna TRIP."},
{"title": "Tiny Towns on a Drizzly Summer Day", "date": "Wednesday, June 28, 2023", "text": "I keep to my old pharmacist in Sumas because 1. The man is professional, kind and knows his shit, and 2. He saved my husband's life not once, but twice.  Both times from fatal drug interactions. (When you live in the ass end of nowhere, your town doesn't attract those A students from Harvard Med.) Anyway, this gives me a chance to get out of Bellingham and back out into the wilds of Whatcom County. And man, is it wild out that way lately!  Due to an unusually chilly, rainy Spring and early Summer, the plant life is coming up tall, green and rank.  It's like driving through the Willamette Valley, and it smells glorious, unless someone is spreading manure.  Then not so much.Feed corn foreground, random farm being encroached upon by blackberries center, a metric shit-ton of mountains and foothills rear.  Mt. Baker was hiding in the clouds, but it's there. Really.Here we are way out in the middle of nowhere, and here are some cows.  Nice.   I got way down in the weeds to nab this picture of super chunky baby corn so you'd better appreciate it.   The nearest little town to Sumas (that still stands) is a 'twinned' town:  Everson/Nooksack.  We have a lot of twinned towns in Washington and I have no idea why.  I've been told that the E-N split came about because of an unpopular property tax.  The people decided that rather than get over themselves, they'd just that divided the town along the main street. Everything North became Nooksack, everything South, Everson. Each side paid the tax of their choice. I would have chosen to pay no tax whatsoever, myself, but this all happened way back in the 1800's when people were drunk a lot of the time.This is the main street of Nooksack:Yup. That's it.  Two blocks. A molasses company (of all random things) and a coffee hut on the right, and two blocks of old, old cement and brick storefronts on the left. They have an elected mayor and city council and baby and all. Yeah, all the roads out here look like this, and most are worse.  It's because everything in this end of the Fraser River Valley floodplain floats on a thick layer of clay, and the ground shifts enormously. They dribble a little hot tar on the cracks all year long and hope for the best.This ^^^ is Rodreguez Auto, where we used to take all our business.  Did they run fast and loose?  Yes. 'Cash only' got you all the favors.  You did not ask why. They did not tell you.Notice how the building is leaning out toward the road.  This road and this town are sinking, is why. Out here where you don't go nark on your neighbors to Code Enforcement, how you deal with subsidence is up to you. When the foundations and floors of these places rot out, they just lift the buildings up, build a new foundation atop the old one, and lower the building down on that, or, like Rodreguiz, build four steps down from the sidewalk to the floor inside.  The tan building on the far left has four layers of foundations, like stripes going along the lower walls inside - and each layer is below grade. Presently it sits on a row of dry-laid cinderblocks covered in a skim coat of pool cement on the outside so as not to attract attention.See the hint of aquamarine to the right?  That is...The mighty Three Flavors Restaurant of which legends sing   Now listen - I'm serious here.  Only cool people can know about this place, OK? so don't go spreading it around.  This is the BEST restaurant in the county. I do not exaggerate nor do I lie.  Nobody knows about this place unless they live in a six-mile radius.  And the owners work at keeping it this way too.  See the sign in the window that says 'restaurant'? It's because people kept driving past the flat sign, thinking it was the kitchen of a taco wagon. They don't even advertise in the papers. I mean look at the size of this town and you tell me if you'd expect to find fine freakin' dining here.  But here it is - and not a single sunflower, a scrap of chintz or an overpainted rooster statue will you find within. I know, right?   Of note is the fact that these are the only three wooden buildings left in the 'downtown' area.  Two of them, center and right, are true, back-in-the-day Old West False Front jobs, but the tall parts got sheared off years back by storms, and since false fronts serve no purpose anyway, they weren't worth re-erecting I guess.  There used to be floating wooden sidewalks out front too until the highway department made them take them out (they'd break loose and float out into the middle of the road during floods.)Now let's travel three blocks down and visit Everson, which also has it's own Mayor, city council, and baby and all, because that'll show those Nooksack bastards!Boom, here we are in front of the oldest building in town that isn't a farm, barn or outbuilding. People still refer to this as the 'new' city hall, and......they still refer to this as the 'new' police station.Are you noticing a theme of poured concrete?  It's because this used to be big timber country.  The fire hazard wasn't so much up in the nearby woods as it was in the enormous timber yards that covered this end of the valley  - and also the astounding number of timber buildings, from houses to one room cabins.  The fires would start in the Autumn and hopscotch from cabin to cabin, sweeping across this whole end of the valley (unless you had a good pump and were near a creek, which explains the few survivors from that time.) Imagine if you had a business, how sick you'd get of rebuilding shit every November.  Because this was very prosperous country - until after WWII - smart businessmen built in cast as soon as the money came in from the first insurance settlement. Most of these cement buildings have been built back many times over the years, starting from an empty, charred concrete box. Yup. Here is a shot of the old Main Street of Everson:Six blocks of businesses, about 2/3 of them occupied.   And here is a shot of what people with too much at stake to sell out are still engaged in doing, going on nearly two years after the big flood:We're still in downtown.  This place is in the middle of an old creek channel that was re-routed in the late 1800's by the Canadians (it's just behind me.) This house had endured decades of mild flooding, but after this last big one, they've raised the sills ten feet off the ground and built a 'flow through' foundation.  I guess if ya gotta stay, ya gotta plan for the future.  These folks own the little nine-hole golf course behind - note the faded sign - and a lot of land around town.  They've cast their lot.  I can't say this is a bad decision either. Adapt, migrate or die, man.  Right next door we have this place.This place was flooded FIVE FEET DEEP for over a week. See that stripe below the big windows?  That's where the siding is still missing - the current tore the boards off.  Once those waters went down, the owners just scraped out the mud, gave it a fresh coat of paint, and moved back in - the same thing that most people in Sumas, Nooksack and Everson have done. This is a Sears house too, so it was built between 1910 and 1940.  It's been flooded out many, many times since it's been built. Imagine what's going on inside those walls, and under those floors. Imagine what's been growing in that old horsehair lath and plaster behind the wallpaper.Here we are in downtown Sumas, 2023.  In the very center of this picture you can see a pointy evergreen tree sticking up above that red car.  Everything beyond that point is Canada.  There are a few odd collections of towers and grey circles in the background - that's all microwave shit for border security, and the tall pole with the box on top to your left is a spy cam. Roughly five city blocks (about 15 Sumas city blocks coming in at 118,500 square feet per. You're welcome.) of businesses and homes, about 3/4 of which are occupied, which is a freakin'  miracle.  Now for the parade of New Foundations:Four feet highThree feet highFour feet high, with flood debris in the foregroundSix feet high with flood debris and fill in foregroundThree feet high    I have about ten more pictures but one assumes your ass gets the point. Depending on what little pothole you live it, or how long you intend to live in Sumas, those new foundations run from three to seven feet high.  Yes I hollered at people and asked.Ever run into Old West town names like \"Unsolved Murder Corners\" or \"Incest Corners\" and wondered what the hell they meant by 'corners' and why there were so many little towns with the same name?  Well, here's one.\"Corners\" means it's on a four-way intersection. Welcome to Hinote's Corners.I've heard that this was a place where walking trails crossed and the different NA bands would gather and trade.   After awhile some dude named Hinote bought a farm near here, and the locals got together and chased out the Red Man so Manifest Destiny could play out. Hinotes has grown a surprising amount over the past twenty years and now has the potential to be a town, but for now it's just a tiny, two-block cluster of random small businesses.When people say Hinotes Corner this gas station is usually what they mean. For ages this was the only business here. Nowadays, this is the Mexican gas station. Right behind me is the white gas station, because that's the way shit is out here.  The Mexican gas station put their donkey planter right out front too, so everyone gets it, and there it is by the white door.  They have a minimart and sell ice, propane (and propane accessories) vapes, bongs, hotcase, firewood, bait and a whole wonderland of Mexican and Hindi tchotkes.  They also have a restaurant kitchen for their taco wagon business on the side of the building:They do nothing but bank money all day long.  How does the other gas station stay in business?  They have local contracts. They fix Dakotas, Range Rovers and Cadillacs.  They sell a little gas too, but good luck rousting a jockey if you get out of your car and you aren't the right color.  You're expected to know what that donkey planter means.  No shit.I could have gone into this in greater depth with better pictures but I didn't so suffer. Well...nah, I should be humble. I'm still getting used to taking pix with this camera and I must have dropped it about 50 times and taken all the images of my fingers and the side of the car and it was a huge mess.  I promise I'll do better next time!"},

{"title": "Rats With Thumbs", "date": "Wednesday, June 21, 2023", "text": "In Sumas, the raccoons stuck strictly to my weird neighbor's place and I was fine with that because the weird neighbors themselves were very raccoon-like (smelly, disease vectors, like to root around in the trash.)  My thought was \"Go. Party. Live in a discarded sofa on the side of the road. Be happy.\"  And they were, until they abandoned the house and it was declared a biohazard and the fire department had to burn it down.How many of you have been hanging around Steve (or Paul) this long? ^^^It was so ammoniac and horrible inside this house that the air quality warning sirens the poor firemen were wearing were going off the whole time they were setting up the burn. This, my friends, is why we don't hoard animals.A fireman at the end of the rainbow!         Before moving back to Bellingham, I had only seen a live raccoon in daylight four times in my whole freakin' life.  Once here, I began seeing them going past my back slider nearly every day, waddling along in a nonchalant manner.  One night I woke up to clattering only to turn on the light and see two big ol' honkin' raccoons mere inches away on the other side of the glass, standing on their hind legs looking at me like I was the problem.    Whenever I see the things I chase them off. And they go. Not leaping away in terror, the way you should when a mighty Apex Predator bids you begone, oh no.  They just amble. Like \"OK sugar pie, be that way. We'll let it go.\" And they were always headed down the same direction. Why?I found out this last May, when it got warm, and it began raining. They were going to the wooded space between my building and the next one down, shitting in a heap at the base of a tree. The tree right outside my bathroom window. What had until then been refrigerated became, that warm, rainy Spring night, a Lovecraftian nightmare-mound of nauseating yellow and orange fungus, semisolids, tall cilia and stench. I opened the bathroom window to clear the steam and DAMN. NO. WHAT THE HELL.               And that's the story of how I discovered the phenomenon of The Raccoon Latrine!You didn't need this picture, but you got this picture.    Apparently raccoons will pick out specific locations to take a dump, and they'll all use that same little exclusive spot to hang ass like the dirty, disgusting little freaks they are. These communal haystacks of crap are called a raccoon latrine  (link provided in case you wanted to look up the crapping habits of raccoons. Who knows with you people.) Call me picky, but I feel that a raccoon latrine belongs in the damn woods, not in the middle of a high-end apartment complex.  Raccoons are not cute. They are not funny. They are Rats With Thumbs.  Good thing I've been plying our handyman with Bushmills.  He is mine to command.   I was able to get him to set traps tout de suite, and he's been catching the masked bastards right and left since late May. He says he lets them loose down in Skagit.  I am happy to leave it at that. We smile."},

Yeah, I'm weak. I thought I'd put vintage cookbooks behind me five or six years ago, but the pull was just too strong. The instant I saw it I had to get this classic from my childhood:Ta daaa!  Ta da ta da ta daaaaa!   My mom had this cookbook. EVERYBODY had this cookbook.  This is the culinary identity of Milwaukie, Oregon c. 1964 - 1975 (when sun dried tomatoes came in.)I'm going to note here:  any ingredient or combination of ingredients I mention from here on out is actually in this cookbook.  Don't come crying to me afterward like you weren't warned because you were.See, back when cows weren't a critically endangered species like they are now, if price is anything to go by, ground beef was for folks on a budget, which was a euphemism for poor.  Of course, we were ALL on a budget.  But! If you zhuzhed up that ground beef with stuff like burgundy, deviled ham out of a can or cinnamon, well that was a horse of a different flavor. The more obscure the ingredients, the merrier. It said 'I shop like a rich person.' The more obscene the combination, the better. It made you look adventurous and broad-minded. Therefore:     If you mushed bananas into the ground beef, fried that, and dumped a red wine sauce made using orange marmalade over it -  JACKPOT BABY YOU WIN! Yes. That is a real recipe out of this book. \"This is my fault. I am the one who brought you here. I am the one that said \"keep reading I dare you.\" I am the one who is gonna write about raw liver. It is my fault, because it is my blog. Everything has to be my way. And this is where we've ended up and it's all because of me.\"     Crimes against mankind aside, half the recipes in here are pretty good. (Naturally, we won't be spending much time on them. This is Steve, baby.)  I can say that for a fact because I've had about 3/4 of the stuff in The Ground Beef Cookbook.  They're the dishes I remember eating when we had guests, at friends' homes, after funerals and at lodge picnics and reunions.  You got familiar with them quickly, seeing them at every potluck and buffet, and knew your favorites.  The trick, as a kid, was to go through the line authoritatively or you'd get some old bag chasing you around with Campbells Soup Green Beans, squash casserole, or some sauerkrauty abomination insisting you eat some vegetables. You had to use strategy. You had to step into the middle of the line and quickly occupy your paper plate territory with delicious Spanish Meatballs and keep on moving. No more room for Bean Salad, Gladys! **Because this cookbook was published in 1965, there are many horrible, inappropriate, and scary ingredients in use. There is far too much soy sauce, for starters. It doesn't need to be in everything. There is ketchup all over the place. There are canned tamales. Used as an ingredient. LOOK AT THEM.   Lunchmeat. Cornflakes. Raw liver. White bread and wheat bread. Potted meat product. Eggplant in places where eggplant does not belong. American cheese. Bologna. Bananas.  Oatmeal. Canned prunes.  Karo Syrup and way, way, way too much Worcestershire sauce. Not that Worcestershire sauce isn't good, it is - but because back in the day, all we had was Frenches' terrible Worcestershire sauce. Everybody's mom, per Frenchs' magazine campaign 'Make hamburger night zesty!' was already dumping that stuff in their meatloaf and hamburgers by the half-cup, and it was awful. All you could taste was vinegar, indigestion and brownness. Utter complete garbage Worcestershire sauce     Once Lea and Perrins hit the shelves, even us 'budget' people started buying it.  Fuck French's Worcestershire. Fuck it in the heart.When seasonings are used, they are used in minute 1/4 teaspoon amounts. Tabasco sauce is measured out by the drop like it's plutonium.  All chili powder is mild and used in trace amounts, and the chili sauce called for is the weird stuff in the bottle that isn't even hot and has no chilis in it at all. None. I don't understand it and it frightens me. In contrast, tomatoes - canned, peeled, unpeeled, chopped, pureed, stewed, whole, sauce, paste, ketchup, tomato soup, oh my yes, throw all the tomatoes at that ground beef. All of them except the fresh, raw kind.  'cuz fresh tomatoes are the Devil!    I love that so many of the recipes here have glam names - well, glamourous for blue-collar Oregon of the early 1960's.  Indian Meatballs, for example. It is a perfectly mundane meatball recipe save for the addition of soy sauce, bran cereal flakes (??) and exactly 3/4 teaspoon of sugar. What makes them Indian?  Which Indians do they mean? Where did they get bran flakes?Watercress Beef Patties with Oriental Sauce contains a shake of allspice. I think the shake of allspice is what makes it Oriental. Or maybe I'm wrong.  Could be the watercress.  Could be the Worcestershire sauce.Beef Tomato Swirls sounds like something a ballerina conjured up in her Parisian garret one rainy Sunday afternoon, doesn't it? What it is, is ground chuck, Worcestershire sauce, canned tomato soup and cheddar cheese.  Rolled into a log, baked, and...sliced.  Now, this tastes OK. But it doesn't swirl at all. It doesn't have a swirl design either. It looks like a grey CD lying on your plate bleeding grease. Here is a picture of a jolly jack tar dancing with a can of corned beef. I hope he doesn't step in that leghold trap someone left on the deck.  Coffee Glazed Hamburger Patties are said to have a 'surprising' flavor, which I'm sure they do, given the half- cup of rolled oats in there. For the glaze? Oho.  You dump a half-cup of ketchup into a half-cup of cold coffee and let your patties blurble around in that mixture until the excess liquid evaporates and voila - trauma. German Meatballs contain brown sugar, allspice and nutmeg - which tracks, actually. Oh, but if they'd only put in some caraway too. Then they could have called them UberGerman Meatballs.  This is the most German dude on the Internet and he is playing German Meatball Tennis. If you throw a meatball at him he catches it in his mouth. If you don't he whaps you with the racquet.    The worst concoction in The Sunset Ground Beef Cookbook is on page 34. Now, on page 35, there is a recipe for Meatloaf With Prunes, which is frankly vile, but must take the silver because it is something you might feed a parrot and it would be good for the parrot. No, our winner is an agglomeration of random, pointless indecency that mocks the entire concept of food.  Before you continue, you need to sprinkle a circle of salt around yourself OK? Light a few candles. do a novena. This is going to be really, really bad. First, there is THE LOAF.  It is an average loaf.  You're feeling safe.  Right?Then, there is THE FROSTING.  Who thought 'Hey, you know what would be a trip is if we put frosting on a meatloaf! You know, like it's a cake, but it's really a meatloaf!'  Bad toilet people is who. The frosting is made of boiled and mashed sweet potatoes, mixed with chopped onion, brown sugar and cinnamon. You slap it on the loaf and slide it around until that meaty loaf is entirely orange and smells like a forgotton pumpkin pie in the trash.  Here. Have an antacid. OK now let's continue.   There is a sauce for this frosty, meaty loaf.  Oh yeah there is. THE SAUCEOnions. Green pepper. Celery. Garlic. Margarine. Lemon Juice. White Sugar.  Mustard. Cinnamon. Four drops of Tabasco - no more, no less!HALF A CUP OF EFFIN' KETCHUP.AND HALF A CUP OF RAISINS.__________________________________________________________________________________**Come on, Americans, you all remember this stuff.  It is simply not a smorgasbord without the damn Bean Salad, with all those little beans pressed up against the clear plastic bowl like the faces of drowned sailors.1 can red kidney beans, extra bland1 can cut green beans, extra bland1 can garbanzo beans, extra bland1 can black-eye beans, extra bland2 1/2 cups minced celery1 bunch green onions, chopped 1 tiny, tiny clove of garlic, mincedone small jar stuffed green olives, sliced1 can sliced black olives1/2 cup salad oil1/2 cup red wine vinegar2 tablespoons brown sugar - Oh hell, make it fourSalt and pepper because that's what people doYou have ten minutes. 1.

{"title": "An Update On The Classics", "date": "Monday, June 12, 2023", "text": "I had SUCH A RANT...and then Bob came up with the perfect cartoon (go visit his blog, folks.  It's GOOD:   I Should Be Laughing.) When I was growing up, the school board didn't feel that we little geniuses needed to learn world Geography because 'Geography doesn't matter', as we were told.  This means that I'm laughably clueless when it comes to the locations of different countries and their governments and stuff. Take for example what I learned today. Today - this very day! - I learned that it snows in Australia.I ran across a video of kangaroos romping around in the snow and my immediate thought was 'Oh those poor things, trapped in some shitty zoo up in Chicago' because Australia Is Of Course Tropical and Hence No Snow.  And this bothered me until I checked online and discovered that yes, the video was taken in Australia, and yes, actual snow falls on Australia. This lead to the discovery that there is such a thing as the Australian Alps, where people ski.  Well now of course my mind is completely blown so I need a Bloody Mary. I'm just sitting here sipping my tasty beverage and mulling over the whole snow in Australia concept.  Who the fuck knew.________________Inexplicable DeVice requested pictures of my attempts to be arty, so here you go:Sorry for the reflections.  The two white things are fortunes out of fortune cookies that I jammed in the frame there, not part of the fookin' ART.  Which is a collage of hand-laid papers with three layers of overprinting and stain that you can't see.  Not because it's secret, but because I can't take a photo to save my ass, so these images are all bleached out.        This is one of the few paintings I've done.  I used three layers of acrylic overpaint on top of strips of tape.  When it dried I pulled off the tape, which pulled off uneven oblong patches of overpaint and left jagged edges, which made me happy. This is vivid blue with tiny patches of Screaming Paris Pink.I go through weird periods of time when I get obsessed with the color blue, to the point that there are certain shades that literally make my mouth water, which is super weird, but there you go.  Then it goes away for awhile. And then it comes back, and I plant a zillion blue flowers, or I paint my bathroom orchid blue, or I do blue 'art'.  This ^^^ is what I did last Summer when the color blue was all up in my shit.  Then came this last Winter, and the color blue came back to visit, and I did a bunch of blue turtle embroideries.Like this guy.    I don't know if color obsession is an ADHD thing or not.  I do know that there's a component of sensory crossover because normally I don't want to eat non-food items, but I would eat the colors peacock blue, indigo, and (car paint color) Banner Blue because I find them literally mouth-watering.  And I'm not playing this for laughs either.  It gets this way.  Basically I am a mess. ________________________Gilbert Shelton famously wrote 'Smoking pot and drinking beer is like pissing into the wind' and while that doesn't quite capture the tone of what's to follow, it just came to mind, so yeah.  I do know that I'll not be smoking pot and drinking hard liquor again any time soon. I had forgotten that thing where you drop off to sleep like a sack of shit, only to wake up suddenly in the middle of the night feeling all janky, having to take a desperate steaming pot piss. Stagger off to the bathroom, leave it smelling like the alley behind the middle school, get back to bed and can't sleep, because every time you start to drop off your heart rate ramps up and you're listening for intruders and shit, and this happens over and over until you finally get too exhausted to rally the adrenaline anymore. Then you wake up around noon and you smell like the used towel bin at the Pot Olympics, and you've got atomic cottonmouth so you drink out of the faucet until you gurgle. Then you eat three orange marmalade sandwiches, and that makes your teeth squeak, and you sit and worry about diabetes all afternoon.  Or maybe that's all me. Nonetheless.  Thought I'd mention it."},

I hadn't slept well in four days (wonder why?)________________________________________I finally got out of the apartment today.  Lovely Spring day.  Perfect weather. I took a walk around my neighborhood and felt pretty happy about the whole scene, babaloo.Then I went to Value Village.Value Village is a resale department store here in the U.S. It is by no means the cheapest one but it is the most reliable.  See something you like in any pricey retail shop around town or online?  You'll find it for so much less at Value Village, minus the taint of religion.I was able to score two canvasses and some snazzy household necessities and do a lot of people watching.  The vibe was really great.  I think everyone there was high on good weather too, just like I was.Canvasses? You ask. Yes you do. Don't lie.I have it in mind to make myself a Soviet Constructivist piece (anybody here a Franz Ferdinand fan? Then you know what I mean.)  Not this one, Lord no, but...yeah.      What I do is I find home decor prints or art school stuff (we have several colleges and universities  nearby and those kids are not budgeting wisely, to my great delight) and I re-use the grounds, otherwise known as scraping off impasto with the side of a spoon and using bad cusses.I've been doing abstracts for years, mainly collage-tissot-mixed media stuff. That makes it sound really sophisticated, right? It's not. At all. When I do it, it's strictly an act of craft, not art.  I like it though, and during warm weather it's just way more comfortable to work on something that has you moving around, than to sit in one spot under a harsh light embroidering or doing calligraphy or whatever I do. I don't know.  What I do know is that I was for a long while a pretty fair representationalist,  until I woke up one day and realized that I really don't like representationalism at all.I am a picture of MT RAINIER DAMMIT and I will always be a picture of Mt. Rainier just sitting here on your wall like a fake window with unchanging scenery!  Lake, trees, mountains, weird cloud, FROZEN IN TIME DAMMIT, catching your eyes with my vastness and mountainness.  Dammit      I feel like representational art is begging me to look at it as though it were a living thing, and wanting me to concoct a specific story or feel a specific thing, and seriously fuck that.  The reason I feel this way is that I grew up with the walls of my home covered with pictures of Jesus and the Saints* - and they were a JUDGEMENTAL group. The Saints were all showing you just how much horror they'd suffered unselfishly for your sake (no, no, don't thank me, just...I just wanted you to see the torture I went through in all it's bloody, sickening detail, here on the wall of your kitchen. That's all. Just...show you. In your kitchen here.)Jesus was the absolute worst. He was either making you feel sorry for him or making you feel deficient in faith, devotion, loyalty, love, piety... or just showing you his bleeding heart all stuck full of thorns, ON FIRE, with this expression on his face like you personally struck the match, and you know what, Jesus, you live in this house and tell me if I need to feel any worse, OK dude? was my thought.  Do you see what poor me goes through on your behalf YOU SELFISH SINNING BASTARD?  (alternate caption:  \"Pardon me, do you have any Grey Poupon?)  This is also why I decorate with abstracts and graphics. You will not find any family photos on my walls - oh HELL no.  All the family photos are kept in a box, where they belong for a number of reasons, but  I digress.So that is what I'll be doing today, is spraying over a god-horrid canvas decor piece with Krylon to achieve a neutral ground that I can cover in geometric shapes and shit like that. With an eye to the Soviets.

I can't believe you actually did this, but it wasn't as scary as I'd thought it would be! (OK internationalistas, this is US homemaker-media star Martha Stewart, whose tagline is 'It's a good thing!' AKA The Whitest Woman In America.  She was a tastemaker in the 80's, 90's, and 00's; then she met Snoop Dog. and started mokin da doink.  Now look at her. 81 years old. Tch.

They juggle transmissions.  A cat, which I've named Chinese Water Torture Cat (esq.) It gets blocked in the kitchen and left alone all day long. Kitty has taken the creative route in letting it's displeasure with this arrangement be known by climbing into the dishwasher and pushing the racks out, flipping the cabinet doors over and over again,  and knocking shit off the counters. It is very good at what it does and I for one am clear on what this animal wants. It wants a bazooka. Bohernomun's large dog I've named Itchyzooma also practices the art of creative disruption.  And this one trick has stopped conversation down here several times already. The dog gets underneath the dining room chair rungs and begins thumping the floor as it kicks at an itchy spot - you know that sound, right?  But in doing so, it moves itself, the table and the other chairs all over the dining room. Eech eech eech eech eech eech eech crash eech crash eech eech eech eech scrape eech eech eech rattle rattle eech eech eech eech eech eech eech eech thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump crash thump thump thump.  I've had five people down here stop, sit back and stare at the ceiling in utter disbelief, listening to this performance.Let's not forget the merry-go-round of boyfriends:  Sid from Ice Age, Charles Addams-Version Gomez,Imagine looking back at that.  ...Wow I Can See White All Around Your Eyeballs, Shithouse Rhymes, Backup Alarm, and assorted others. And their belongings.  They're all made out of concrete. And Berbassoonda's new problem:  The imaginary woman across the lot.Last week:Every day for the past eight days I've had to listen to her ranting on the phone about this supposed woman across the lot who's out to get her.  She speaks in a braying honk, and the concept 'use your indoor voice' is not part of her social lexicon. Well, not in the social lexicon of the meth she's smoking.The landlord came asking me about this situation, and we compared notes, and oddly enough! the stories she's hearing are not the stories I'm hearing.  First of all, there is no woman across the lot.  (The question 'why is a non-resident contacting our landlord who just threw her out again about an imaginary resident's harassment' did not come up.)  Yeah. The apartment where all this is supposed to be coming from is VACANT.   Second of all, Berbassoonda is not supposed to be here.  Again. The landlord told her to leave. Again. And out she went.  Two hours later she was back in a different car. Now she's up there with a ten pound hammer building a stone dildo.___________________Currently:Berbassoonda was kicked out again this last Saturday morning. Out she went.  Back she came  in a different car. After a few words with her sister upstairs, back out she went. The day goes on.  Literally ten minutes after Upstairsie leaves for work, here comes Berbassonda AND Bohernomun, and twenty people, plus kids,  blasting in off the street, up the parking lot, out of their cars and up the stairs, where they all proceeded to put on their Kiss boots, these ones right here   crank up the house music,  and run up and down the parking lot shouting 'Motherfucker' and various racial epithets for no good reason I could make out. It was like a bad mondo movie!  Like the party montage in She Devils On Wheels!  They did this nonstop until well after noise curfew, which is 10 p.m. here.  The Biker and I decided to call it at 10:30, and we had trouble getting through because of all the other calls the landlord was taking about the same issue. Result - Bohernomun and her Panzer Attack Morris Dancers pack up and leave. Berbassoonda gets kicked out again.  She leaves too.  An hour later Berbassoonda comes walking back up the parking lot.  She has parked her highly identifiable car out on the street. CRAFTY.Sunday morning she gets kicked out again.  Sunday afternoon she comes back and drops off Chinese Water Torture Cat. And leaves. Today I can hear CWTC up there - right now, in fact! flipping the kitchen cabinet doors.  Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and and over and___________________Any questions?  Ask 'em.  Let's see if I can squeeze another post out of this topic."},
{"title": "Again?", "date": "Tuesday, May 16, 2023", "text": "Yes. Again.I have to break it to all of you ONCE AGAIN, and it's all the fault of the UK because look at this horseshit here: The search for British Bigfoot - The FaceYou know what people, it's an island. A very crowded island. It's already chock skippy full of every single supernatural wazoolie there is. You have enough problems now that LIZARD PEOPLE Camilla and Chuck LIZARD LIZARD have been crowned and LIZARD are on the LIZARD PEOPLE LIVING ON THE BLOOD OF INFANTS British freakin' throneLIZARD PEOPLE FFS.      HOW MUCH MORE OBVIOUS DOES IT HAVE TO GET ? He's taunting you! Look at this shameless lizard bastard!      Come on. Don't start claiming Bigfoot. You don't have room for Bigfoot. LIZARD PEOPLE JOE BIDEN LIZARD BOY SLAP FIVE.  WELL FINE THEN MISS BOSSY, WHO IS BIGFOOT/SASQUATCH????Well I will tell your ass. Ramp it back, geeze.First of all, Bigfoot/Sasquatch = same damn thing.  Lives exclusively on the Northern American Continent.  How am I so certain?  I grew up with Bigfoot. I mean, he didn't go to my grade school, right; but yeah. Bigfoot was a fact. All the older people in my neighborhood believed (and these are covered wagon, Great Migration folks from all over Scandinavia who got here and went straight to work up in the woods)  because they'd all seen the fucker.  Heck, they even believed in 'Little People' who were just, like, a foot tall and didn't seem to do much but be abnormally short.  And while our parents tried to laugh that stuff off, if you caught them at the perfect level on the drunkometer they'd tell their personal encounter with Bigfoot story too, and then yell at you.    Here's what we knew. Bigfoots - yes, that's the plural, if you grew up in the Oregon School system - are between 7 and 8 feet tall, and are simply primitive cave people who decided they didn't want to be civilized. They just evolved differently because of the cold. So yes, they're just super-hairy naked people who live up in the mountains in caves and run around doing cave stuff, whatever that might entail. And everyone agreed - Bigfoot does not scream, yell, or yodel.  He whistles. Kind of like you might whistle while you were washing out your unmentionables or fixing the bottle capper on your model A.  Don't make me get out the Elk video again. Seriously don't. I'll do it. If you're out in the wilderness at night for whatever reason, and you hear something that sounds like a zombie hooting through a traffic cone?  That's AN ELK.  Don't go hooting back at it. An elk will come up and stab the crap out of you with its horns and then stomp your corpse into chunky rags. This shit happens. Elk suck.  Look it up. I won't give you a link. You're grown. TODAY'S BIGFOOT         Our zeitgeist hero knows his ale from his porter and his arabica from his robusta. Drives a hybrid. Protects the environment. Picks birds out of the sky and eats them raw.   He's the mascot of the 'Thang' up here in the PNW.  He's done his reps, and he voluntarily got a vasectomy after two kids. The guy still lives in a cave up on Mt. Hood, but he puts in his public appearances as Douglas Fir, the Trailblazers team mascot, and, you know, cashes his check and goes back to his cave.Yes that's my fridge. Edith The Egg Lady keeps him company. In fact there are so many places, teams, businesses and tchotchkes that use his image that it's safe to say Bigfoot is not hurting financially.  This is why he continues to exist! He's SMART. It isn't all about the hiding and messing with people for fun anymore. He grew with the times and changed his approach! He's very adaptable. Mystery solved.BIGFOOT MANQUEThis is our guy, though. This is Real Bigfoot.* He has been known to get buck wild.        Meet the Jack Links Sasquatch! Uses that raccoon to wipe his ass.  Once the Lexus LC is parked behind the cave, occasionally he'll get into the elderberries and decide to play up and pick on some poor holler dweller just for the sake of cussedness. He'll besiege you for a whole week of nights, throwing rocks at your house, breaking your windows, slinging trash around the yard, tearing off the siding, chasing chickens, smashing outbuildings, freaking out the dog, and tipping over the outhouse with you inside. - oh, and stealing your wife for a hot session back at the cave.  She might come back, she might not.  If she does come back, she'll be knocked up, hence....THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE RELATED TO BIGFOOTNo shit. This is a real thing. I heard this a few times back in Oregon, but more often here in Washington - up around Baker, Marietta and Lummi, out on the Peninsula, back by the Okanagan and around Highway 395 and Ponderay.  There are just people out there who are related to Bigfoot. Just...average people. They aren't super hairy or anything. They're just related to Sasquatch.Just average Pacific Northwest people accused of petty theft who are also related to Bigfoot.  DO NOT MIX UP BIGFOOTS WITH STICK INDIANSI knew you were going to so STOP. Stick Indians are altogether different than Sasquatches. First of all, they're magic.  Do NOT talk about them because it only attracts their attention and they just get ugly and mean; and pretty soon your kids are missing and your car is stolen and your tractor is missing both back tires and all you can do is stand there and say 'Fuck me running I should not have gone and on about the damn Stick Indians, look at this shit.'  The reason I'm getting away with it is because 1. Duh I'm typing, and 2. I'm not using their real name. 3e. You don't get to know their real name either. Ha.Now there you go. To reiterate:  There are no Bigfoots in the UK. They have a Green Man but he's  made of leaves and his feet are size 9W UK. Not everybody can have a Sasquatch. Only cool people.But you can have Jack Links delicious meat snacks!  Go online and get yourself an assortment!  If you can take the heat the Harbanero is awesome.  Even the weird flavors like Dill Pickle are super tasty.  To be absolutely fair, though, I should warn you - drink a good amount of water while you're snacking on this stuff because it is constipating.   Beef Jerky Protein Snacks | Gluten-Free Meat Snacks | Jack Link's (jacklinks.com)____________________________________________*Brian Steele plays the Jack Links Sasquatch to perfection.  He's a costume actor who's been all over the movies for years. He's even been a couple of different flavors of Predator, which makes him OK in my book.About Jack Links:  The tagline is 'Feed Your Wild Side' and the premise is, Bigfoot has been messing with us for years, so when you feed your wild side, you are emboldened to mess with Bigfoot.  The ad campaign, oddly enough, is called 'Messin' With Sasquatch' and...it's pretty stupid humor, frankly. The popularity relies on their having put the time and effort into making a 100% spot on, frighteningly believable, Terry Gilliam-quality Sasquatch.  OH OK FINE here's a link:  (Jon won't be able to use it)(15) Messin With Sasquatch Greatest Hits - YouTube"},

Oh my God it sucked. Just really, really sucked on a Black Hole level of suckage.  So anyway there I am and it's eleven o'clock and I've got a YouTube playlist going. Up pops a song I haven't heard in fifteen years.Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters, by Elton freakin' John. I sang every single word of that song without even needing to think about it.  Then I thought 'What in the sweet hell just happened?\"Now back in 1972-3 I was Miss Elton John Super Fan of America, the Moon, Mars and the Universe.  I had every single American release. I had bootleg copies. I had the soundtrack to 'Friends'. I had the Elton John poster where he's bare chested, mostly. Oooooo, my dad hated this poster. Absolutely hated it.    I went to his concert and there opening for him was Kiki Dee (who had the music in her.  Boy, did she.  \"Kiki Dee, set me free, Kiki Dee, set me free, Kiki Dee, set me free, Kiki Dee, set me free.\"  There was a full fifteen minutes of her singing that phrase. I hope somebody freed her, shit.)  I embroidered an Elton John pair of overalls with lightning bolts and glowing hands of benediction and other ridiculous things on it, along with the initials 'RKD' done in silver beads. Yes, I wore it in public.   Well, there you go, right? I was a thirteen-year-old kid, so that was my job, to be embarrassing and do lame things.  My nickname might have been 'Reggie'.  I embroidered the back piece of a Levi's jacket with the 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road' album cover, and made a little money from that; which wasn't bad for a Jr. High kid.  And then Caribou came out in 1974, and I was a freshman in High School, and I got over Elton. While he was doing his goofy pinball thingamaroo I was busy trying to get rid of my virginity. This is me being sexy in 1974: \"Hi I read Tolkein  LETS DRINK KEROSEEEEEENE\"    So yesterday evening, just for shits and giggles, I found an Elton John Channel, and be ding-danged if I couldn't sing every single song from all the records I'd owned. I mean like even 'No Shoestrings on Louise' and 'Western Ford Gateway' and 'Amoreena'. Ha ha. That gets back my upstairs neighbor for rapping in the bathroom because I played it loud and I sang very badly. Take that, Shithouse Rhymes. Every couple of years I get surprised by Elton John like this. Fucker rings my doorbell and wants to come in and reminisce, and it's just not the same, dude; and he stinks up the bathroom. If you search 'Funny Toilet' you get this.  I've been laughing for five minutes because the first thing I thought was 'Elmo's seen some shit'.  ITS FUNNY DAMMIT      What I mean to say is, one of Elton Johns' songs will come on the radio and I'll trip on how easily the words come back. If I'd known what a mental sponge I was back in 1972-3 I would like to think that I would have committed more useful things to memory, like the Naval Chain of Command, or how banking and investment works or something. But no. All I have to show for Jr. High is a battered sense of self-esteem and a head full of Bernie Taupin lyrics.GET OUT OF MY HEAD"},

They had armies of lawyers and detectives, they had lines into talent agencies, security companies, psychiatrists' files, accounting firms, you name it. They openly solicited the public too - and they paid BIG. The Enquirer could be absolutely depended upon to get it first and get it right.But aw geeze man, that was no fun.So up slipped the Weekly World News.  Now the difference between them and the Enquirer was that WWN was blatant, utter, and absolute fabrication.  And lo, the shoppers were happy once again, and sales of Good Housekeeping and Womens Day plummeted.  They might have had diets, they might have had fashion, but they didn't have socko headlines likeI remember an interview with the owner, who said 'I sell this paper. This paper here. Just the paper. You can use it for wrapping things, whatever you like.  Now what I choose to decorate this paper with...well, you buy what you feel like buying.\" And people felt like buying it A Lot.  You can't lose with headlines like my personal favorite:DA DA DA DA DA DUMMMMMMMMM!  NENENENENENEENE DA DA DUMMMMMM! He's lonesome, wild and freeeeeeeee, hey Bat Boy! *whip crack*     This was the beginning of a Bat Boy saga that lasted for years. He got captured, he escaped, he crashed Spring Break, he ran around biting people, he was up for Governor of California, he went on the hunt for Bin Laden, he was - well, he was fuckin' fictional, but he was a busy dude. At one point he joined forces with The Worlds Biggest Baby.  And that baby was a big old heefin' baby.  They got up to hijinks.Out of nowhere the other day I suddenly thought \"I wonder what ever happened to Bat Boy and The Worlds Biggest Baby?\"  As though they were relatives I hadn't seen for awhile. So I went for a look.Sadly, The Worlds Biggest Baby has shuffled off this mortal coil.  Sumo Wrestler Once Known as 'World's Heaviest Child' Dead at 21 (people.com)But Bat Boy's star kept on rising!  He ran opposite Trump for the White House! NOW you wish you'd have registered to vote, huh.          Bat Boy stepped right up to the plate and took his test like a half-man, dammit!And then, because he just wasn't special enough...This is not a joke. This is for real. Somebody wrote Batboy: The Musical. And it's an Off-Broadway HIT.   Bat Boy: The Musical - WikipediaI hate to tell you how many people out there actually believed this stuff. Before you scoff - remember, this is the country that did not realize until after his death that Liberace was gay. These are the citizens that thought The Colbert Report was real news.  One of my mother's best friends believed every single word of crap like this.  She'd sit there and rattle on about this alien civilization that lived inside Mt. Shasta and Russian satellites that controlled the damn weather and everyone would just nod and smile and chime in with their own B.S.  And the fuck's my excuse? I've never read a copy of the Weekly World News in my life!  Yet here I am with stupid Bat Boy stuck in my head. Why?  And the Worlds Biggest Baby!  I literally cannot remember my own phone number, yet I remember when Bat Boy was captured by scientists and there was an actual public protest for his release!  You know who I blame? I BLAME THE DEEP STATE      The Weekly World News - now 200% more tongue in cheek:  Weekly World News - The World’s Only Reliable News"},

Some have pieced tops, and some have embroidered tops. I don't have time to go dicking around with a quilting frame or to go paying a shop to put it through a longarm.  Quilts are about saving money!  I'll be dipped before I pay between $100.00 - $350.00 for that B.S.

{"title": "Aventuras en la Cocina a Go Go!", "date": "Saturday, April 15, 2023", "text": "NO I have not forgotten you, my darlings!  No no no.  I was just being lazy. Pure sloth on my part.So slothful that my magnificent slothful zeal must be caged.   During this period of inactivity I actually accomplished a lot.  Most of it was boring. I'll spare you that, and instead recount the thrilling tale of How The Biker and FirstNations discovered a meal so holy, so tasty, so satisfying and so filled with cholesterol and saturated fats that even the plaque forming in your bloodstream will feel shame. This manna from Heaven is known asBirria.       Our story:  One of the Bikers buddies at work was walking around carrying a styro clamshell which was giving forth an aroma born in Paradise. Naturally The Biker followed this guy around the plant until he trapped him in a filthy restroom stall, kicked him unconscious, swiped his lunch and took a piss on him.NO!  Ha ha!  That is not what happened at all. Things like that never happen here.   WTF UK.  (Taken from an article in the Mirror. A more sober, reliable source you will not find.) Also, what the fuck's up with the radioactive eyeball dog? WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING OVER THERE?    Our local Birriaria is in the middle of a tiny little strip mall.  As soon as we walked in we knew we were in for a treat. How?  Because right next to the cash register was a cooler full of Mexican Coca-Cola. (Just - just, dammit, calm down! I'll tell you about Mexican Coca Cola in a sec.  Geeze.)  We get our birria plates. Our meals look...like they've been made by...people with a different food aesthetic. -fine. Not delicious. Oh, but they are delicious. It's twoo.Oh, it is! It is!!!!!   This is how it shapes up. Birria is made in an enormous, enormous pot full of spices, other stuff, lard and Beef. Around the sides of this pot hang colanders full of chicken, turkey, maybe goat, and pork, all simmering in the same consomme, as it's called on the menu (they sell it by the cup!!!!!) They add a little water, a little this and that if the pot gets low, and it just rolls on, getting more complex and tastier.There isn't a picture in all the webiverse that reveals the true ugliness of birria, so brace yourselves. If you order birria cheese tacos, what you will receive looks like a plate full ancient Egyptian rehydrated pussy.Oh how I wish I were exaggerating.    It just does.  And the next paragraph is just as unnecessarily descriptive.They grab a plastic platter and lay a piece of checkered paper on it. They then lay down one flour tortilla and put cheese on it. Queso Oaxaca, I think. Maybe plain Monterrey Jack.  Then they lay another flour tortilla on top of that. Next they fish around in the truly vast, soul-swallowing vat of birria and pick out the protein of your choice, which has simmered to rags, and splorch it on top. A flood of Consomme mixes with orange - colored oil on the platter. They fold this pile of tortillas, cheese and meat in half and then dip it in their deep fryer for a three count.  It comes out of the deep fryer the color of a flaming sunset (Let's say Pantone Orange 021 HC) and goes straight onto your flooded, paper-lined platter, with a little more of the protein of your choice on top of it all, then a ladle full of the consomme, PLUS six deep-fried serrano peppers in the skin.  Now as someone who knows their ancient Egyptian dehydrated pussy, I can tell you a lot of things you'd expect from me after a lead in like that.   The thing is, you have to trust me. Birria is ugly, it is bad for you, and it is the most delicious meal The Biker and I have eaten IN. FREAKING. DECADES. Oh oh oh crap, yes, the Mexican Coca-Cola. OK.  Here in the U.S., Coke is made by making Hello Kitty pee in a bottle.  And as tempting as that sounds, it isn't anything compared to the delicious, delicious flavor of Mexican Coca-Cola, which is made using the original recipe just as God intended!  See the paper label?  That's what Mexican Coke has to have slapped on it in order to be sold in the U.S.A. Basically, they're shipping the original, delicious Coke in from a foreign country back to the country where the original recipe was invented - the same country which now drinks (in blind, market-generated ignorance) a hell-substance made of maltose, corn syrup, and LIES.   Living on the West Coast, I've known about Mexican Coke since the Eighties, but I guess for a large part of the world this is voodoo magic, so let me be the one to clue you in. Coke used to be made using unbleached cane sugar - and that's it, just unbleached cane sugar - as a sweetener.  It's the Coke we all drank when we were kids.*  Those of you living in climes foreign might find Original Recipe Coke being sold as 'Kosher for Passover' Coke. Either way, BUY IT.  The difference in flavor is unbelievable and you will send me $9000.00 in gratitude for bringing light to your beveragey darkness. Now go forth and do whatever it is you do._____________________________*At least everybody but Miss Scarlet, who is only 16."},

I did. You know I did. Don't lie.  I totally got you with the sheep pussy thing. But speaking of horse condoms, let me express my utter delight at having received a statement from the Social Security Administration telling me all about the pittance I'll be getting after I 'retire'.  Oh, and my Medicare 'benefits', although how anything that amounts to a proffered Band-aide and a glass of tepid water can be called a benefit escapes me. Perhaps because it's better than a peck in the head with a sharp rock?  I say it's relative.  You can get a peck in the head with a sharp rock for free. To get Social Security you have to make a bunch of appointments and fill out things online and sort through reams of mailings. For months.  And Medicare?  Enrollment after enrollment after negotiation after application after turndown after enrollment.As far as the cash amount goes - let me put it this way.  I just bought four pairs of slacks and four character t's, the combined cost of which adds up to 1/3 of what I'll be getting from Social Security. So if I were single? That means every month for the rest of my life, I could buy twelve pairs of slacks and twelve character t's.  And get a Band-Aide and a glass of tepid water. I didn't expect anything different, to be honest.As things stand, and in the best case, we'll spend our waning days in North Carolina in a tiny home, under the scrutiny of a family member I often find disagreeable. I am not looking forward to the move, or the location, but as I drive past the homeless encampment just down the street from me, I realize things could easily be a hell of a lot worse.  Hopefully by the time it comes to moving South, they'll be letting me have the good drugs.  Hell, if I can still drive, I'll be able to buy them without a prescription, so never mind. I'm good.  -Where am I going, disagreeable family member?  Oh, I just thought I'd, um, hang out in the parking lot in front of WalMart for a few hours.

Heh.  I'm going to bring the Jimmy Castor Bunch up on stage to lead us in.\"We're gonna go back. Way back. Back into time. When the only people that existed were troglodytes. Cave men.Cave women.Neandertal.TROGLODYTES.Let's take the average cave man at home, listening to his stereo.  Sometimes he'd get up, start to move. Try to do his thing.\"...and sometimes his thing wasn't up to the task, so he went for his cave dildo.    Look at them. Cavewomen! HA.  What we have here are butt toys, snatch toys, and one - damn, #4 - freak of nature.  (And if any of you know Mr. Mago, please let him know about his incredible cultural heritage, would you?)A couple of these were made to resemble animal dicks.One of these may have been used on an animal. Yes.To induce oestrus. This is something that still happens. Today. In agriculture. Real, non-fetishy agriculture.  And the most likely animal that a cave dick of this size would have been used on would have been a pig, otherwise known as cheap quality protein, the thriftiest animal going.  The idea is, pig goes into heat on your schedule, pig gets boyfriend, pig has more pigs, we all have ham. Or tiny pig on rye. It's Germany. This is a case of having on hand the right tool for the right job. There's the ass cave dick, the snatch cave dick, and the Dammit Irene I can't get this sow going by myself, hand me a #10 cave dick. Yes, I've just alluded to man-on-pig action.  Hello, Vase de Noces fans! ___________________________  CAVE SHAMANS   I want you to ask yourself what all those 'shaman' cave paintings were about. (You:  Damn I wonder what all those shaman cave paintings were about. What an oddly specific, random thought.)  They call those figures shamans, anyway; a picture of some guy with an animal head and a boner who hangs around with animals. This guy is dressed as a pinecone in opera gloves. Bison love that shit.For years these scenes were thought to depict hunting and magic and animal spirits, the idea being, nobody reads, so you draw a man - animal hybrid. I suppose they pointed to it and said 'This animal headed thing is the animal's spirit, or perhaps it's god. Either way, let's pray for it to die.'   Now you have to ask \"Why a dude?  Why not a woman?\" I'll wait.Could be because the immediate vicinity of the painting was a sacred, male-only cult space, like (blogger of your choice here)'s ass.Could be that the female 'shamans' were washed off by way-too-Christian explorers. \"Oh la,\" they said, because they talked like that. \"That is unspeakably bestial, Satanic, and obscene. Get a bucket and a brush.\"  But it could very well be that some of the depictions are about very early attempts at domesticating animals, like a how-to visual aid. Bear with me. Not a pun.Cave people were smart. That much is fact. And they necessarily noticed very specific things about animal behavior because they needed groceries.  Now, key to domesticating animals is 1. Meticulous observation 2. Taking charge of their reproductive cycle, and 3. Habituating them to a human presence. The 'Shaman', then, could just be a visual mnemonic for 'Kids, be like Mr. Proto-Herdsperson here. PH is out there like a badass with his flock, knows animal habits like he was born one of them, and it is absolutely imperative that those gals get the D when it's convenient for you.'  But. It could just as easily mean \"Dress up in an animal costume, and then book ass into the middle of a herd of wooly rhinos with an erection.\"  I'll elucidate after a line of asterixis.*********  Now.  What if, and this is a big, big if, so hang on and we'll all get through this together... domestication didn't start out as domestication at all? You have to wonder how someone even came up with the idea. Animals RUN AWAY.  They fight back, they're stronger than you, and they're present in their teeming millions in 50,000 - 10,000 B.C.  Domestication is a helluva cognitive leap. What if all this 'I have an animal head and I like to hang out - forgive me- with the herd' art was depicting an initiation task?   Say, one just like the one a couple of well-known motorcycle gangs still put their prospects through?  \"Thats why they call me...Oosik.\" -OK it means a walrus' penis bone. It's called an Oosik. He banged a walrus, OK? Good God this is funny on so many different levels. This means that what we thought was \"Shaman in the Herd\" ochre on stone, artist unknown, c. 50,000 B.C. is actually \"Initiate In A Stupid Hat About to Fuck a Camel\" ochre on stone, artist unknown, c. 50,000 B.C.You've seen James Herriot up to his shoulder in a cow, right?  He's taking advantage of one of the dirty little secrets of agriculture:  Animals...don't necessarily object. To certain treatment. Ahem. OK like I don't mean chickens, I mean, you know, real animals. Horses and cows and stuff.  You know, animals. This really is one theory of how hunters became herders. If you want to verify it, you'll have to dig really really deep and learn anthropological things you really, really wish you hadn't, because then as now, what happens in the herd tends to stay in Enumclaw.  (I dare you to look that up.)   So here we are.It's Rush Week for our man Blarg. He's got his animal head costume. He's out on the mountainside with his crew and they're all like 'Go on! Get out there! Shh! You shhh.' and stuff.   He sneaks up to a filly, casts his bolo, and...that happens.  Yippie ki yo ki yay, Blarg is now a full member of the Concatenated Order of Hoo Hoo. Blarg and Co. go off and party. Meanwhile, the horse, with the scent of Blargs manliness lingering in her nostrils, follows Blarg downmountain for some more of that sweet sweet Neanderdick. And then it's simply a case of 'Can Blarg keep horse? It friendly! Blarg certain.' Yes indeed. This very argument has been made. Yes it has. By people with degrees. From German universities."},

Take a moment to consider the irony. Five minutes later, the customer service person, who had been standing ten feet away from me jacking her jaws, came over. Then I had to wait for ten more minutes while the machine adamantly refused to accept her employee code six times in a row.  Then the rotating red assistance light on the check stand went on, and all the clerks rolled their eyes and sighed. At that point I said, conversationally, 'You know what, I'm done. Fuck this place. ' It was a conversational 'fuck' not an abusive 'fuck'. Anyway, yeah. Then I just walked out.I surprised myself.  It came so naturally.  I didn't feel an ounce of guilt.  I was not mad.

And how many movies can you say that about? Not too many, Spanky.  They could completely be from the same genus, just different species.  Although Cloverfield (spoiler alert!) is extraterrestrial.  After extensive research I have concluded that Cloverfields come from meteorites.  The first ones landed here on that meteorite that wiped out all the tracheotosaurs and had been running around on the sea floor eating dead Aztecs (because of the cenotes!  That meteorite split into pieces and went all birdshot on the Yucatan Peninsula and drilled it full of holes that filled up with water. What do you do with something like that in your Aztec back yard? You throw other Aztecs into it. The Cloverfields smell that happening and dig passages from the ocean to the cenotes and eat the dead Aztecs. Keep up.)  Then one branch split off and migrated to Greece, where it mutated into Krakens.  Or a single Kraken.  And then it ate Argo.The Argo corn starch lady is a super foxy corn lady.  _____________________________________There is nothing to compare to being able to follow one's interests in solitude.  I love my solitude.  This is another thing I've discovered since I turned old all of a sudden. Solitude is bliss!   When I think of all the quality time I lost due to feeling pressured to go out into public and interact, I want to weep.  I spent way too much time worrying 'Am I social enough?' and not nearly enough time doing interesting things like undertaking extensive research in order to reveal how a kraken/the kraken is descended from Cloverfields. We didn't even know about Cloverfields until 2008. Fun fact!I also just read The Vision of Tundale which is a super trippy piece of writing that came along, quite conveniently, about the same time that the Church invented Purgatory. This caused the French to build the Cathedral of Autun for lepers, who have leprosy because they are, for real, God said, suffering the actual torments of Purgatory right here on Earth in front of your face. Then Dante, not to be outdone by people with chunks falling off of them, got on the Purgatory bandwagon and whipped out The Inferno, The Purgatorio (see?) and the Paradisio.  Finally it was 1452 and DaVinci said this is really getting stupid. He cut up a bunch of dead people, drew pictures of it, and then he moved to France and died.  This is why France sucks. ____________________________________Inexplicable DeVice just had a birthday!  And how lucky is he, who is a them, to be able to celebrate numerous birthdays simultaneously?  I gave them a birthday gift and everything.

Or not. Maybe you were all high and shit.   Moment dog tied to trolley urinates at Trader Joe's | Metro News   Clearly it's the dog owners who are the problem. Pity it's against the law to smash their heads against the curb, because this is a problem that demands a human head be smashed against a curb. At first I was going to say 'rub their noses in what their dog did' but you risk offending the dog. Thing is, here in Bellingham, it's not just dogs. It's also miniature horses; I kid thee not, cats, medium sized pigs, rats, goats, ferrets, chickens, snakes, rabbits, possums, raccoons, parrots, wolves, mice, hamsters, coyotes, guinea pigs and lizards.  This is not cool. I am not impressed.

It's not an emotional support animal. It's a fucking lizard. Nobody thinks you're cool.

Big tramautic shit happens, and I jump ship for a year.  And I don't see it as a charming foible either; it's not an attribute I am proud of in any way.  Still, there it is - I retreat to my Rancho of Solitude and go incommunicado.  Even with the outside world.How this has fucked me well and truly this time around is that, between me crawling into a hole and pulling it after me, and two years of Covid, I am now three years out of date. On everything.That's a lot these days, come to find out.I went on a news blackout.  Oh, a few things slipped in (I've been following the slowly sinking plague ship that is Trump and all he claims with the greatest imaginable enjoyment), but on the main I just didn't keep up.  Dang. Some shit happened out there.  And you folks are getting around!  Ikea-ABBA concerts and trans-world romps, pun intended if you so desire, and babies and graduations and new love affairs - wow!Me?  I  1. Re-examined and finally altered my study objectives,My hero. Been studying his life and times for over twenty years. No shit. Me. Your secret Italian Renaissance specialist. Yup.  AND2. Began reading 'The Classics' in a serious way.And you know what?  I'm happy.  To be able to devote whole, uninterrupted days to my study interests is the most satisfying thing I've done in years.  I can't garden anymore, but dammit, I can still grow my brain.  I am reading all the classics, too, like The Epic of Gilgamesh and shit like that, not just English lit, because the Earth is round and covered in people and has been for a longass time and I need to read the words of all the people.  They have important things to say. Looking forward to the Tale of Genji. Fuckin' A right, I know how to party.   I'm glad I waited until I was in my sixties to hit 'The Classics' because I would not have had the necessary context laid down in order for some of this to slot into place. For instance, I just finished 'Silas Marner.'  If I'd had to read that back in High School -when U.S. kids of my generation were traditionally made to choke down 'Moby Dick' 'The Mill On The Floss' 'Beowulf' and all things Jane Austen - I would have thrown Silas across the fucking room. and said screw English Literature. Give me drugs. NOW.  I would have grown up good for nothing but lying on a couch eating Cheetos and dipshitting around on my phone because my brain would be a vast empty wilderness full of vast emptiness.And Cheetos. Yuck. Rather have a mouthful of dick than Cheetos.  Wouldn't you?    I won't bore you with my reading list. But one thing I have determined after numerous dips into the pool is I SURE IN THE FUCK plan to avoid Jane Austen because NO. This is exactly the kind of content I turn to when I want to be entertained - the facile doings of a bunch of self-conscious high-school soshes with too much money, in a Regency setting.I read Jane Eyre, it was good, and that's all the rural minor nobility/ class struggle/ dance of manners and taste I need for the rest of my goddamn life.  Have I tried reading Austen? Yes. Many times, over the years. And many times over the years, Jane Austin took a flying lesson across the room. Bam hit the wall every time. Fuck Jane Austin.  Now Oscar Wilde? OH YES INDEED.

It's been almost a year since I last drove past the place, and not a single thing had been touched, repaired, hauled away or cleaned.  The city had an 'upkeep notice' posted in the yard.  No longer my problem.____________________Get ready for a lot of ellipses and dashes.____________________In Washington State, it is absolutely legal to purchase, grow and carry around marijuana. Has been since 2013. I have a retail outlet I like and frequent.  It's located in an old drive-thru coffee hut, and I adore the whole concept.  From 'Three seeds in your purse = seven years in jail' to 'Hi! My name is Cleome, I'll be your budstress today! May I take your order?'  (And yes, budstress is a real term. 'Budtender' is the male version.  I know.)    I buy a couple of pre-rolls every month or so because I'm a cheap date. It doesn't take much to get me roasted. These days you can just name your preference - mine is indica, locally grown - and off I go,  and I buy me two fat swaggy cones for 1970's prices. Life is GOOD in my old age.  I no longer have to visit vile freaky houses in the middle of the night and freeze my ass off in the rain waiting for a baggie to be handed out through the fuckin' cat door.Now, because I came of pot-smoking age in the 1970's, I save my roaches. I remember the Great Marijuana Drought of 1976.  The government sprayed crops willy-nilly, from Alaska to Mexico, rumors of paraquat and genocide abounded, paranoia spread throughout the land, and all you could find was $25.00 a 1/4 Mexican Dirtweed,  or homegrown - which was not kolas, kids. It was shade foliage and stems. For $25.00 a 1/4.  That's $114.71 goddamn dollars in 2023 US cash. So yeah, you saved your roaches.So here I am in the future with a buttload of roaches.I go online to look up new methods of using roaches, trying to stay up to date and all, maybe learn some new technique, and what do I find? CHEMISTRY EXPERIMENTS.  All this shit using butane and sub-zero freezing equipment and lab ethanol and honestly, after three pages of this, and reading numerous comments on forums that went 'Ew yuck! Just throw them away! Ew!  Nasty! They're useless! Gross! Barf!' and so forth, I had to back off and have a beer.I'm assuming some of you are being frugal and saving your roaches too.  And it's possible that I am preaching to the choir. In case I am not though, no no no. No yuck. No throwing away of roaches.No no no no no.You take those roaches, cut them into tiny shreds with a scissors and you soak all that in FUCKING VODKA.  I mean Good Gravy Marie people, this is not rocket surgery.  If some sad child o' the Eighties is going to get squicky about the flavor, NUT UP.  This is not meant to be snorked and slurped and gazed at thoughtfully or rolled around in the mouth like a fine wine you MORON.  Listen to Grandma. You pound this. Boom. Down the hatch. We caught up?  OK.What follows is an unnecessarily detailed recipe. ________________Don't throw away your roaches. Instead, makeTincture of Roach1 pint - Cheapest Vodka (or any high-test hard alcohol) you can find, in bottle, with lidAll -  your roaches, rendered into little pieces with lots of surface area via whatever meansInstructions:1. Pour yourself a shot of vodka. Drink it.  Now that you have room in the bottle, dump the roach fragments into the pint of vodka (or what have you.)  Cap it tightly and then shake for as long as you can deal with shaking this container.  Contents will turn black-brown and get thick and chunky. Keep shaking. Enlist the efforts of others.  Shake this bad boy UP.2. Store in a cool, dark place for 30 days.  This basically means not next to a fireplace or a heat duct.  Room temp is just fine.  An unheated garage would be optimum, but there's really no reason to take things that far.  As far as the darkness goes, I don't really know how this works or doesn't work; just do it my way because it's Muk tested and Muk approved.3. After 30  days, shake again for a ridiculously long time.  Replace in cool dark place.4. Wait 30 more days. 4.5 At the end of those 30 days, remove from cool dark place. Do not shake. Do not agitate. Let it settle.  In the meantime, ready a clean, empty glass container with a generous mouth, fitted with a funnel in which a coffee strainer has been placed.5. Being careful not to agitate the nasty weird guck that is your vodka and roach mix, tip it slowly into the coffee filter.  The upper portion of this liquid should be a clearish yellow color, and there should be a bottom layer of pure evil.  Carry on. Fear not. Simply tip the clear stuff s l o w l y through the filter, and then follow it with the sediment.  Dump it all out and let it sit there in the coffee filter, straining away into the clean glass container, overnight.6. Next day!  Good morning! You now have a clean glass container filled with tobacco yellow fluid that has a bottom layer of black sediment.  It will smell like a used ash tray full of vodka. This is what you want. Yes it is. Don't argue.7. Throw away the coffee filter and its horrifying contents. Don't bother squeezing them to get the last drops. It's spent. Get rid of it.  Wash the funnel.  Pitch the empty pint. Wash your hands.  Now - put a lid on the filtered liquid you collected in the clean jar and put it in the refrigerator.  YOU'RE DONE!How to use:  A real Viking will unscrew the lid, take a slash and pass it around to his/her fellow Vikings, who will also take a rip and not bitch about how it tastes. You're a Viking, right? Like you give a shit!  Tomorrow you're gonna rape a bunch of nuns! Non-Vikings: Mix with the undiluted Torani syrup of your choosing.  Man, do NOT use peppermint or cherry flavoring because there will be projectile vomiting. I don't know why this is true but it is.Bon vivants: Mix like any cocktail that uses vodka as an ingredient and pretend you don't notice the burning restroom flavor.It'll hit you in about 15 minutes.  Take a few moments to savor and assess this state of being, and then proceed with due care. Believe me, this stuff is potent (and here your persnickety ass was going to throw those roaches away? For shame!) So there you go.  No Freon, no Pyrex containers, no burning motor homes.  Far from being waste, roaches are a prime source of crunchy brain fodder.  For the shamefully low price of a pint of shitty vodka you can have hours of fun. I like to spend that time misusing lighters and aerosol hairspray.Bonus Fun Fact!If you've been worried about intestinal parasites, worry no more, bucko. Vodka-Roach tincture, once ingested, will kill everything in you that isn't you, and some of it might still be recognizable the next time you take a dump (oh yes) so if you're into that kind of thing, be on the lookout. No I am not joking.________________________How you doin'?"},

I am soooo cozy.My go-to for all things rare and sweet is Herbie Hancock. You've all heard the ferociously danceable \"Rockit\".  Well here they are, the gang from 'Future Shock.'He's done some things that aren't to my taste but the man has never put out a bad song.  He's like the caffeine/chocolate/opioids of jazz - the man just makes everything better.  Even if he's just sitting on on keyboards, that piece is going to be 100% better for his presence.  This is a true fact, no bullshit.Another man that deserves national treasure status is Stanley Clarke.                                      I was just a poo-butt kid, but I knew quality when I heard it. I saw him live years ago in 1976.  I can't even remember who I went with.  I'll spare you the tale; if you've been a-hangin' round Paul or Steve for awhile you'll have heard me go on and on about that concert before, so I'll just shoot you a link to his 1974 album:Stanley Clarke Album - YouTubeAnd what is the first cut called?  VULCAN PRINCESS.                                          T'Pring, you dumb bitch.  You passed up Spock for that?  I saw Stanley Clarke play 'Vulcan Princess' LIVE. Lost my mind?????ANYway.  Back to the present.So I'm putting together my third Space Bedroom.  My first one was just a few movie posters.  The second one was way over the top.  Sort of Space-Goth. I painted my bedroom this super dark burned espresso color and then dotted it all over, and I mean All Over, floor, furniture, linens and ceiling, with glow in the dark galaxies and constellations, lovingly applied with a fine brush.  It was wicked bad and disorienting as hell once the lights had charged up the paint. I had blackout drapes, and the instant you closed the door those stars would fade up and daaaaamn.  I liked it.This time I'm paring it down to some Trek collectables and some new posters and lobby cards.  I have a Deco chrome blender that The Biker turned into a table lamp for me, and - what?  Everyone in the future will have blenders that serve double duty as table lamps. Don't question my motives.I found a nice cheap poster of 'Metropolis', the gold and black one, and that's on the outside of my bedroom door, like I'm twelve or something.  The Biker gave it the hairy eyeball this afternoon. I just said \"God made man. Man made Maria.\" all portentously like you do when you're trying to impress someone with your knowledge of science fiction and shit. Anyway, he has nothing to feel all holier than thou about. There's this.  When you figure the man subjected me to this atrocity:Yes it's Robert Williams, yes it's 21st century edge street-pop-car culture-West Coast, but honestly, it's huge and he had it hanging in his room as soon as you opened the door, and you know what; I just quit vacuuming in there.yeah, that fucking thing, for years, until I took to keeping his bedroom door shut all the time?  He can just put up with lovely, soulless, intimidating Maria, the antithesis of everything good in this world.  I mean it's just pop art too. There really isn't that much difference, right?                                                                         You tell me. I thought seriously about doing a 'Spocks cabin', and if Mr. Beast is still out there lurking, he'll remember the epic Trek House we both coveted, where the woman who owned the place had done the whole interior over to resemble the starship Enterprise set.  It had a Vulcan themed telephone nook. Now that's class right there.And then I thought 'No, I don't own this place, and I'm going to go looking for that weird shimmery fabric or the expanded metal dividers. Life is too short.'  And they sell that shit online.  It's tempting.  But so is owning a 'Forbidden Planet' poster.  And a 'Gort and Klaatu' poster.  And a '2001' poster. And a 'Things to Come' (1936) poster.  And maybe some replica spaceships hanging from the ceiling on fishing line.  I did buy another bottle of glow in the dark paint....I already bought a 'femme of the future' moderne dresser for a steal. That and my nightstand are going to be painted silver once the weather improves.Yes. Everyone in the future will have chrome bedroom furniture and dual-purpose blenders.

The worst years of being a mother and a wife happened in that house.  The last few years I've lived in constant dread of the horrible winters.  I could go into a hundred other worries and negative vibe sources associated with that house and the property and the town and the region.Y'all are saying 'but what about your garden?'Kids, I was at the end of my ability to keep up with the garden. I still love plants and I've been thinking of ways to finagle my way into someone's yard.  The urge hasn't left me.  I already have one person nearby seduced with promises of David Austin roses and rampageous clumps of Japanese irises. Nice small yard. Tools supplied. Yeaaaaaah.All of next Spring and Summer I get to go back to Sumas to keep the joint from looking like it's abandoned, at least from the outside.  It has to sell and it will sell, believe it or not.  It's going on the market. That's written in stone. The regional infrastructure in place is so obsolete, the area so imperiled, so many lies were told over the years, and the local governments so in denial that it would be idiocy to hang onto the property any longer.   For me, this coming summer will be like a weaning process.  A prolonged farewell to horticulture.  I'll distribute a few things locally to old friends, put stuff out next to the road with a \"Free ( fill in the name of a plant)! Bucket and All!\" sign.  I'll talk to all my Canadian tourists, say goodbye and thank you; and maybe unload some stuff that way too. It's time for that to happen.  I won't miss the backbreaking labor that tending a mature garden takes.  It's 20% enjoyment and 80% culling, trimming, cutting back and reiving out when it gets to this point, and I am no longer up to climbing trees with a chainsaw, hauling around 100lb. clumps of overgrown hosta crowns and turning a compost heap that is half as tall as my house.  OR sifting the motherfucker; I mean Jesus in a bouncy castle already.  For the past five years my life went like this:I got three months - March, April and May, to keep June, July, and August from looking like shit. Full eight-hour days.  In and out of the house, drinking water like a fish, slathered in sunscreen, always tired, always in pain, always tripping over shit or stuck full of thorns or falling on my ass.  During June, July, and August I sat trapped in the house and sweated while the heat and humidity rendered everything a nightmare, only sneaking out in the early morning or after the sun had gone down to do some necessary stuff.  Early in the morning, starting in September I'd be able to grab a few more hours each day to go out and speed-garden. October was all labor all the time, until it got too cold and rained too much, and all for the sake of November, December, January, and February not looking like shit.So there's that.  Now I'm two Bloody Mary's in (four, the way I pour 'em) and I'm gonna go full bore now.If this flood had not happened, we would have spent the rest of our days pouring money down a shithole. Hiring repairmen, hiring contractors,  hiring garden help (the poor bastards cringing under threat of the lash... me and my riding crop, all dressed out in latex and spikes in of those funky mask thingies with a zipper where the mouth should be, prowling constantly, looking over their shoulders, making inhuman sounds, drinking from the hearts of the weak etc.) having the house put up on cribs, putting in new sill plates, new window frames, having the old block foundation demolished and hauled away,  getting new foundations poured,  building a new bathroom from the ground up, connecting to the city sewer... increased insurance costs, literally trying to stay above water and losing ground all the time as every single winter hence gnawed away at the house, the outbuildings and the garage.OK. There's that picture painted. I would have been miserable, and my husband would have felt even worse.He goes out there now, most times.  I can't.  There's too much mold growing.  The dust that kicks up is toxic and my lungs are weak.  He's out there mourning.  Brings back a few things.  We clean them off in the bathtub and let them dry on the back porch and then have to clean them again because whatever was dissolved during the flood clings like paint to everything it's touched.  The longer any of our belongings stay there, the more they smell like anaerobic rot, diesel and sewage.Biden finally declared Sumas and Everson federal disaster zones.  We've applied for FIMA assistance, and we'll be meeting the inspector this coming Monday.  If we don't fall outside income and savings restrictions (if any are in place) we should get a little something to put in the bank. At some point in the future. I think. Back to the present moment.The only bitch I have to pick now is the sheer amount of plastic in our daily lives.  It's the difference in the market region.  Twenty miles down the road, North toward the border, people still make their own lye soap and live off the grid.  They still buy things like Lydia Pinkhams - no shit - and alum.  They want to be able to handle their groceries and won't buy if they don't have that kind of assurance.  Here, you have all the Eighties and Nineties babies.  They think nothing of having to unwrap one clementine from three separate layers of plastic packaging.  It's how they were brought up (unless one happened to be in the small minority, whose parents were hippies and belonged to the Co-Op.) Just the ridiculous band-aid idea of reducing plastic waste by outlawing plastic bags? That's just a fart in a hurricane! I trip on the sheer amount of plastic waste I have now.And that's it. That's my only complaint.I've been here before - back in the 1980's and '90's, Portland and Seattle.  All those old habits; never leave your purse unattended, always keep that strap across your body, money in your front pockets, doors locked, windows locked, don't make eye contact with the nutty people, don't advertise your belongings, always size things up going in or out, that's all coming back to me.  Sumas was already in the beginning stages of social decline.  Here it's just back to the damn future with shorter buildings.I'm safer.  I'm warmer.  I have reasonable people in my daily life and they aren't all Dutch ffs.  I get out more and see more things.  I said 'SHIT!' out loud in WinCo yesterday - twice! and nobody infarcted.  Folks know what my 'Weyland Yutani' shirt means.  I'm surrounded by the world again.Fuck Sumas.  That life is over."},

Big pagan presence. Many, many people from places other than Holland.  It's wonderful!  Example:  I can exclaim 'Shit!' absentmindedly and nobody looks at me as though I'd just shot a loop of gut out my ass!  I CAN WEAR MY FRANKIE SAYS RELAX t-shirt and people laugh! And talk to me! About the Eighties! Not about how God disapproves of butt sex!We've been doing a pile of necessary shopping amid all the holiday preppers.  Most of it's just been replacing things we lost in the flood, which was kind of boring (Oo, a blender.  Oo, a toaster.  Oo bedding.)  But now the bulk of that is finished, and we've been able to turn our thoughts more toward Christdugongmas and gifts and thank-you cards, and it's starting to be fun again.                                      'Merry Christdugongmas!  Ho ho holy shit I'm drowning!'Retail is nice.  I have nothing against retail.  But thrift stores are more fun, and the thrift shopping out in this area of Bellingham is fuckin' nuts, y'all.  There are warehouse sized places, small places, weird places, smelly places, clothes only places, machinery and tool - only places, shit; I could keep going but you either get the picture, or you don't care.  I've picked up so many high-end items for so cheap lately it's stupid.  And that stock revolves, let me tell you.  Not a week goes by that they haven't all completely turned their inventory!And here's something that kind of blew me away, now that I'm back in the new and improved, bigger, better, faster Bellingham I've found that in my absence apparently all of Bellingham has become a Designated Wildlife Corridor.  There are warning signs everywhere.  I've seen more of Gods lil' critters here in a week than I did in a month out Sumas way. Deer! Birds galore! The fattest, sleekest squirrels you've ever seen, like real American squirrels that need to go on a damn diet and stop wearing tennis shoes everywhere! Back in 1985, when we first lived in Bellingham, there were the occasional deer, black bear and cougars (the Wilderness Death Kitty kind) roaming around at night right in downtown, and since it invariably follows that where there's deer - and there sure in the fuck are some damn deer  -                                                  Yes. Not even kidding.  Like this.  Don't they look tasty?  - there will also be black bear and Wilderness Death Kitties, I can but surmise that there are now more black bears and Wilderness Death Kitties out there too to go along with all the freakin' damn deer. 'And we're just the vanguard! Let's not forget about coyotes, mink, wolverines, bobcat, martens, velociraptors and bass!'  It's just like living in downtown Portland Oregon again! (sniffle)And let me make the same parallel when it comes to nutty people.  I haven't seen so many free-range nutty people since I left Portland multiple decades of years ago.  (Don't make me count on my fingers, just move on.)  Portland back in the 1970's was overflowing with floridly nutty motherfuckers.  So too is Bellingham lo these many years later.  And the odd thing about the nutty population is:   if they're wearing a lot of pink?  Man or woman, they're meth heads.  I've had lots of people tell me the same thing, and it matches up with my observations. Apparently you ingest a certain amount of meth over time and bammo, you're weird as shit and in the girls' apparel aisle shoplifting tutus.  Meth heads love them some pink clothes.  Dora the Explorer-themed togs are au courant among the meth set, followed by Barbie anything and Glitter Girls. I do not know what this is about, but it's killed my urge to try meth once just to see what it's like.And remember the motto of Christdugongmas:  Don't chew on your mother, even if she's already dead."},

The only problem is that it has km instead of miles on the speedometer, and a bitch does not know metric.  I am a Murrican.  I don't need to know metric.  That's what they told us on sixth grade. We didn't need to know metric OR geography, because Murricans.  We only needed to memorize all the counties in our state and then it was off to play sports!  Because sports are important!  Like cat tits!Anyway, this makes the thing problematic for me to drive, because it's so much more easy to leadfoot the gas when the speedo is telling you that your happy ass is moving at a tremendous rate of speed.  Driving is a competition sport, as we all know, or at least as far as I'm concerned because I never learned geography.  And I'm determined to win, for the cats.I BREAK THE SPEED LIMITS FOR THE CATS.   Imagine that you are a cat-ess and all you have are four tits.  Now imagine all the baby cats out there fighting like Marines every meal time because their mothers have no thumbs and can't spoon feed them, or even hold a bottle of vodka to numb the pain?  Insufficient nipplage is no joke if you're a mommy cat, and baby cats don't know metric because they don't speak English as far as anyone knows.  And that's why I must break the speed limit.

Yeah yeah yeah yeah my wife handles that shit I AM DOING IMPORTANT THINGS PEASANT!Whew!  OK then!On to Crack Country.  Average apartment, average building, rent controlled, but crackheads.Then to the Wood Hood!  Yes, once a former coal mine, now a large flat place riddled with underground tunnels, where all the streets are named after trees and all the people are sketch as fuck.  But it is a nice building, and hell, it's in a neighborhood...near all the stores and services...And in the middle of all this, I travelled nine miles and then waited two hours to speak to a Red Cross representative only to have our case get lost in the system.  Waited some more, sitting in the shelter, smelling the distinct aroma of human feces, amid the Covid cases and a lot of really pissed off people, only to get a phone interview - that could have been conducted anywhere - and  end up re-start a new case with a new case number...only to have the system lock up and be told that 'You'll be hearing from us.'  At least I got a can of tomato juice out of the venture.I also met a couple of grizzled old rips like me there who lost everything in the Sumas flood.  It was kind of nice to meet old neighbors and be able to commiserate with people who 'get it'.  Both women had to be rescued by fishing boat AND by tractor bucket.  One almost drowned when the shelter she was staying in flooded and a floor caved in, and the other has been moved three times already to different shelters.  So there's the 'it could have been worse' factor too. As I was out and about I nearly drove in to Sumas to take a look at the old place, but I just couldn't. It's odd.  I just never want to see it again.  I'll have to of course.  There's things to clean and pack, and roses to dig up and distribute.The thing that gets to me is all the people out there living in their little houses, just like mine, happy about Christmas on the way, warm and dry, probably worried about their mortgages and car payments.  I desperately want one of those little houses.  It doesn't matter where.  I'll make it a home.  I'll stand on the roof and fend off the crackheads.  It doesn't matter.  I just want a little house again.

Really.  ______________________Life in the new motel is going well.  Once again the Sikhs came through for us via a co-worker of the Bikers, and got us a week free at this place owned by one of the Temple members. We'll probably  be able to stay here as long as we need to, and it's clean, bright and economical, too. Most importantly of  all, it's on the second floor.What's strange is being back in a city-suburban surroundings again.  The last time I lived in Bellingham, it was a nice little town.  Now it is a high-density urban sprawl, and there's homeless encampments in every empty lot and down every creek.  Meth is everywhere.  Our room is in a nice area, too!  Clearly I was entirely too isolated in Sumas, because this is fuckin' extreme shit as far as I'm concerned.  About five years ago I worked at a place about half a mile away from our room, and it was a nice 3-star Marriot, brand new, in a newly developed area with it's own brand-new business district.  All that's still there, and still fairly upscale, but it's got homeless people, garbage dumps and abandoned cars everywhere they can fit.  The corners of every parking lot, between buildings, in landscape plantings and what few empty lots are left.  It's really messing with me.  Meth heads roam in packs and do home invasions en masse!Now that being said, we're looking for an apartment in one of the 55 and over developments nearby, since the Biker works three minutes away from where we're staying - he's been walking to work in the mornings, it's so close.  It's simply a matter of finding a vacancy in this particular time and at this time of year.  This genuinely is a nice area, meth heads aside, and the amount of money we're saving on gasoline alone is fucking astounding. EVERYTHING is nearby!  Our friends, public transportation, our doctors offices; you know - civilization!  No livestock! No silage trucks! Supermarkets galore!  Even a sex shop!  All the necessities! So here's the score.  We've been getting the mess cleaned up and the house dried out up in Sumas; we still own that, and we're planning on selling it.  We'll be moving back to Bellingham and into senior rental digs for the rest of our wrinkly lives because frankly, it makes sense.  It's time to let someone else worry about upkeep; and they all have allotments where you can garden.  Hell, I'll sneak in a rose and some ferns and they'll take it and like it.  The flood was a wake-up call.  We need to be way closer to services, and we need to downscale.  These past days have been...enjoyable!  Convenient! Positive, even!  And there's no chance in hell that we'd ever, ever get cut off so fast and so completely as happened in Sumas when the flood hit.  We're well above sea level here on a rise, and the drainage is fantastic. Remember, at 9:30 am the water had reached our backyard.  At 9:52  it began to come into the house. At 10:08 we stepped off our back deck into water that was three feet deep. At 10:10 we were on a raised railbed watching water draining down into our town from a nearby river, and at 10:18 we were speeding down the single open lane of the very last back road out of town, with nothing but rising water in our rear view mirror, covering the road behind us as I watched and the Biker drove like a motherfucker.  That's 48 minutes from a dry house to a house that had two and a half feet of water in it and a town that was COMPLETELY INUNDATED. That's FAST.  Add to that another day and a half trapped on Mt. Baker  because the few roads and bridges were washed out, in a shelter because all the resorts and motels on the mountain were full of skiers and dipshits?  FUCK THAT."},

We're doing the recovery and assessment thing now and we have plans in place and arrangements made. Shit happened. We prevailed. Next!_______________________________We got to relive some good memories unexpectedly while we were up  in Kendall when we ran into a woman from back when we were riding. She had been a bartender at the local Bandido bar, pretty much what you'd expect; a packer like I was, a cheerful hillbilly type lady who took no shit and started a lot, and laughed all the time and partied hard.In the intervening years, she had gone on to get a Masters' degree in Special Education, and works with mentally challenged kids now! She also held the line and stayed in Kendall, which is a little slice of squalid meth hell in the pinewoods, and is a dedicated community volunteer - and there she was volunteering at the shelter!  The thing about her that made this reunion so incredible is that she's the woman who stood by our dear friend, business partner and running buddy Albert Souk while he was dying.  We did a lot of business together over the fifteen years we knew him, oddly all legal (I used to run his stall at the  swap meets and made him a big ol' pile of cash, while he went out doing his social butterfly thing, buying low and selling high.)  He had so much respect that he rode under the name his mother gave him, which believe me, is not something that happens a lot an almost never to people who aren't clubbed up.  We've got a million stories about this guy and all of them are as appalling as they are hysterically funny, but to get down to it, the man loved criminally insane women, and the last one tried to bludgeon him to death. While he had brain cancer.  It put him in hospice.During all the insanity this woman literally stood guard over him and mustered the clans on his behalf.  She made sure that no part of the sideshow nonsense that was his wifes' family and their intrusions and outrages touched him by filling up the place with large men and women with intense attitudes. This was a high-end facility, and for a solid month the sidewalk out front was constantly lined with Harleys.  Everyone came out and represented and kept the peace in his honor. It looked scary walking up on, all those different clubs flying colors, and not all of them friends. But that happened, and this lady coordinated the whole thing.  And, without going into vivid details, because those details are just way over the top biker as fuck, she saw to it that he went out the way he wanted to go out.  Think of a Viking pre-battle feast, except one that went on for a whole month. That's kind of what it was like.It took a little while for us to recognize each other because it's been a lot of years, but once we did she just brightened up our day.  She's still all country, all Bandito, and totally awesome.  We knew we were going to be OK while she was around. That vibe just spreads out from her.  It took our minds and got them right, and we got to hang out with someone from back in the day and reminisce about one of the most awesome people we've ever known and laugh.I'm not going to put her name out there, but she deserves all the good vibes.  She's astounding."},

You can keep them.  Hands across the border.There are pictures, and someday the Biker will email them to me and I'll get them up.  For now I'll give a brief description of what we found, starting outside.-Two steel dumpsters! Big welded steel dumpsters! in our front yard.  One had smashed into our garage door, and the other was stopped by my valiant 'Improved Josephs Coat' rose out front from colliding into our front room.-We have other peoples belongings all over our yard - fence posts, a razor scooter, a girls bicycle helmet, a big Halloween pumpkin in the buddleia, a Betty Boop 'Welcome!' mat in the front  yard, and oh so very much more.-Our entire barbecue deck floated away and is now in the back northeast corner of my back garden piled high against the fence, with all our lawn chairs, random garbage cans and so very, very much more.-Our back deck broke away from the house and is covered in a giant tangle of flotsam and jetsam, railroad ties and mystery belongings, including a Buzz Lightyear coloring book.-The bottom of the garage door blew out. The high water mark was three feet.  Nothing important inside was damaged, thankfully. -Both sheds also flooded at the three foot mark, and my lawnmowers are deceased.-My car was lifted and set at a 45 degree angle to the driveway against the retaining wall, and was filled with water up to the drivers wheel. Borked.-Our truck is salvageable, although waterlogged and in need of a complete oil purge and some jiggering around to break the waterlock. This suits me just fine. I like my truck. I did not like my sedan.  And our SUV is running strong.-The inside of the house got two feet of water.  All the bottom drawers of everything, including the refrigerator are full of water and every drawer made of wood is swollen shut. The furniture is borked - we may be able to salvage the solid wood pieces, though.-We lost nothing whatsoever of any real or sentimental value!!!!!  It's all safely in storage now!!!-Some stuff had floated around in the house.  Not a lot of things, just enough to it kind of amusing.-All the food will have to be thrown away, of course.-And finally, weirdly...MY GARDEN IS ALL THERE AND HAPPY AS A CLAM.  Even though there are places where the wicked current had laid things out, everything is alive, still rooted, kinda dirty.  Even have a couple of roses in bloom, and all the calendula is going nuts too.  I  couldn't believe it!  All that fresh, nasty, reeking silt is probably acting like plant crack, is what I think.The people where the Biker works put together a work party and tomorrow we set out to get the place scraped out and the junk hauled away. Lots of trucks, lots of volunteers. One has a container we can store our salvagables in until we find a place to rent!  With any luck, the next week will see the place squared away enough to be boarded up.Amazing things that happened:Sikhs from the nearby Guru Nanak Gursikh temple, the one that I've been supporting for years with food donations, randomly laid two hot meals of curried rice and lentils on us just for...being in Sumas!  They were helping our pharmacist get his store cleaned out and just had a pile of meals they were distributing to people!  I will always support their temple.  They walk their talk.Our pharmacist gave us our prescriptions for free!I was offered a job working where the Biker works!  (after I described my scant qualifications, I doubt I'll get anything, but the offer was sincere.)  Truthfully, his job is doing so much right now to assist us that I almost burst into tears.  They might even find us a place to rent.It looks  like we'll get FEMA money!The hero in all this is THE BIKER.  Without his fast thinking and his knowledge of  logistical and financial things, along with his amazing memory, his sense to drive back home when he saw shit floating around on the roads and waves in the fields, added to his mad driving skillz?  Without all that my happy ass woulda woke up floating around on my memory foam mattress.  He has brought us through with style and class."},

The area was drained via a system of canals to open up the land for agriculture.Usually when it's flooded in Sumas, it's just been rain accumulation and the runoff from the couple of creeks that go through town, combined with a really high water table. The whole town turned into a big, shallow mud puddle, and only a couple of times. No big deal.This time was different.  We had been having torrential rain storms for the past month almost every night, all falling on land that had been baked solid by last summers dry conditions.  But then, two days ago, we got a hard southerly rainstorm that came through, with high winds and sideways, firehose-type precip, nonstop.The town just south of us is called Nooksack, because the Nooksack river runs through it, and it's a deep, swift river with tall embankments built all along it's bed through the flatlands.  All the rain that fell emptied into the whole of the Nooksack, from where it starts on Mt. Baker and downward until it abruptly hits the flatlands, where it just overtopped all the levees and spread out over the fields.  The floodwaters crept out over the nine miles between us and Nooksack, and came spilling DOWN into Sumas over the railroad embankments, and I know because at one point we were stranded on one such embankment wondering why the water was higher on the south side than on our side, and trippin' balls watching it come cascading down into town.   That's why the water level rose so rapidly beginning at around 8:35 am.  All that river water had just crested the railroad embankments. A helpful diagram.  Not to scale and kind of sideways, but you get the picture. Our house is an unrepairable biohazard now.  The floors and the foundations were pretty iffy, and we were going to wait and re-do them this summer.  Now we don't have to.We are for the present time homeless, and will be until we can get down off this mountain.Here's the thing I can't get over - how nice this facility is!  It's like the grade school I attended.  Everyone has been so kind and the food is pretty good, too.  We're the only flood refugees here, but the place is also a food bank and a Head Start - community center with multiple resources.  In fact, we left this very place, Kendall, where we lived less than a mile down the road from where I sit typing this, because it had become a slum in the deep woods, where meth and crime were rampant.  We moved to Sumas to get our daughter into a better school district, so that worked out.  But here we are right back where we started from, getting our butts saved by a facility that didn't exist here ( and really needed to be here) when we moved away.Our plans for the present are - assess the house, contact our insurance and all the other resources at hand, get an apartment or something in Bellingham to be closer to where the Biker works, get our household situation together and then wait for further developments.  I foresee a huge garage sale in our future."},

Baker - Kendall because all the roads out of the area have been flooded and many of the bridges washed out.  Thank God the Biker thought to come home this morning instead of pushing though to work - the speed with which this came on was unprecedented and it would have been a hell of a lot more difficult to get things situated and he had not been there, my guardian angel, to keep a cool head.I do not know if our house is a loss or not.  I do know that the entire town of Sumas is inundated.Take a look at this shit:https://www.king5.com/article/weather/weather-blog/sumas-flooding-atmospheric-river/281-e5823c49-4269-4145-ad4f-d219b40ba945A day late and a dollar short is how the flooding caught all of us in Sumas.  I honestly think that we were some of the last people who got out of town today, as the back road we took through the cornfields was just beginning to flood out just as we hit the base of the mountains and started up.I've got all my crying done, and now I'm sitting here in a really pleasant facility on a cot.  And that's how things are going for me.  We are safe, we are sheltered, and we have insurance AND money in the bank.  All is not lost. Yup, for the first time, we have completely flooded right up to the foundations. NO I DO NOT HAVE PICTURES. Imagine a whole shitload of water.Last night at 11pm. an alert came over my phone about flood warnings for Sumas between midnight and 3am., and to go to such and such a church for shelter.Well, it was raining, and my phone is always blowing up with bleeps and bloops and alerts and shit, and I just thought nothing of it.  I wake up this morning at 8:30 and find  my husband roaming around. WTF? I think.  Come to find out,  Sumas is cut off.  Everywhere. And that's the first time that's ever happened since we've lived here.  (Of course snow is a different issue.  Everybody freaks out and commences to flail and drive their Yugos around and all kinds of nonsense.)I checked the back yard - always the first thing to flood - when I woke up, and as of twenty minutes ago the water level has risen four inches.We've got another foot and a half before it's actually to the doorsills.  Meanwhile, the garage and both sheds are flooded about an inch or so deep.  And the rain is torrential, heading sideways at us at high speed directly from the West.  Hoo boy.  All that work we just had done on our house...We're in the process of moving all our shit up onto higher stuff inside the house.  There is a very real possibility we may have to evacuate.So, there's that."},

That he should never have received a medical degree in the first place; and that his hurt feelings are clearly more important to him than his patients welfare.  This man actually decided to be a potential disease vector, and thought he was quite the valiant martyr for standing up for his 'rights'.

{"title": "It's Halloween! Time To Scare You!", "date": "Monday, November 1, 2021", "text": "OK fine it's the day after Halloween.You wanna know what's scary?  When you live in a border town and the international line is breached.A couple of days ago someone tried to blast through customs without stopping, and suddenly there arose, at 11A.M., the background track from every documentary concerning the London Blitz you've ever seen at full, screaming volume. Those loud wailing sirens, whistles, all kinds of holy horseshit. I was expecting to see those ICBM contrails come arcing over. I had no idea what was going on at that moment.Here's the deal.I live in the Constitution-free Border Zone.  A quote from the ALCU website: \"The expansion of government power both at and near the border is part of a trend toward expanding police and national security powers without regard to the effect of such expansion on our most fundamental and treasured Constitutional rights. The federal government's dragnet approach to law enforcement and national security is one that is increasingly turning us all into suspects. If Americans do not continue to challenge the expansion of federal power over the individual, we risk forfeiting the fundamental rights and freedoms that we inherited—including the right to simply go about our business free from government interference, harassment and abuse.\"Yes, this is a very real thing. Look up just what that means here. NO, SERIOUSLY. DO IT RIGHT NOW:                               https://www.aclu.org/other/constitution-100-mile-border-zone                                          Old broad goes alt-freak with political post! News at 11! When you contact me, our online interactions are being monitored by Homeland Security and who knows what all Agencies and shit with guns and badges.  Now, me being me, yap first and think later, I have been contacted by some pretty shady entities from all over the world during the course of my online presence, including extremist groups from overseas and Anonymous.  It's all on record somewhere. NO I did not respond, fuck that action! It's one of the many reasons that I'm no longer on Facebook, though.  All of this contact came directly through Facebook. Yup. I did nothing to encourage it. But the wackos out there also have keyword bots, and they use them. In a worst case scenario, just having those cookies on your machine could be construed as highly suspicious by people in positions of authority. Paranoid? With good reason. Homeland Security agents aren't hired to use their abilities of independent thought and judgement, kids. One power-tripping bully can ruin your whole life.                                                       When the child internment camp scandal down at the Southern Border exploded, I went to the Homeland Security installation a mile from where I live, in person, to ask about it. Yes, they have a whole back room full of holding cells - I saw them before they closed the door on me - and more shit underground because I remember them building the place during G.W's 'reign', the same time they put up the spy towers (without a public vote or notification of purpose/ expenditure) all along the northern border of the U.S. Of course I was handled by a flak catcher and gentled along and given no real answers, but the place is serious as a heart attack, and those black and gold helicopters and SUV's are omnipresent, just another part of everyday life here.When I heard those sirens and alarms go off I went right past panic into zombie mode.  I did not know what was going to happen. There's no 'Public Alert' system in place - I had no idea what to expect, and just stood there waiting for something to explode, gunfire, bombs, crashing planes, immanent death, whatever.  Why not?  Clearly there's something going on.  Why would they not want to inform the public?  Gracious, what purpose might that possibly serve; koffkoffintimidationofthecitizenrykoffkoff.I do know that the border is being breached nearly every day, though, that important arrests are being made and serious shit is being apprehended, and that none of that information ever hits the news. I know it for a fact. I've seen it happen.  If you live around here you've seen it happening too...out in farmers fields, in the woods, on the roads, in stores, you name it.  People talk about it. It's known. But less than one fraction of one percent of that activity ever makes the local news outlets, much less the national news.  Think about that.No, we don't have a wall (yet) but there is a long-distance detection protocol in place; it's referred to as 'motion sensors' when it's mentioned at all.  I know for a damn fact that it's more than motion sensors, and I get that the Border Patrol doesn't want to reveal their hand and give the bad guys a tutorial in how to breach the system, so we'll go with 'motion sensors' for the remainder of this paragraph.  Now usually it's tagged animals that trip the alarm (like bears and such that carry tracking devices for the forest service on either side of the line.)  It also catches a lot of on-foot drug traffic and groups of people trying to come over and get work during harvest season; and also ordinary hikers, small aircraft, trained dogs with knapsacks full of oxycodone, 4 wheelers, snowmobilers, cross country skiers, logging trucks, road equipment, farm equipment, and even by flying payloads delivered via trebuchet.  Seriously.  They load timber-built trebuchets with drugs and a tracking chip all wrapped in duct tape, find a nice empty stretch of forest and fire the bundle over the border. Someone is waiting on our other side with a marker detector and goes tootling back through the woods whistling a merry tune, carrying ten pounds of XTC. I can see the clearcut line of the border going right up over the mountains through the timber, laser straight, from my front room window - and the spy towers too.  And those spy towers can see me.Close enough to what ours look like.  They aren't just in a neat line down the border, though - they're dotted here and there all over within the zone.  What you might think is just a cell tower has about a 50/50 chance of being a spy tower with a different configuration. Hit up Google images for more. Right after they first went up, I used to go walk my dogs near the ones here in town and moon them, I was so angry about not having been informed or given a choice (all while GW was crying poverty and recession and shutting down public services right and left.) It was a HUGE construction operation, very intensive, very sudden, very organized and well funded, whammo, out of nowhere, blocking traffic, ripping up streets and digging up private land.  And those towers are built to look scary, too.  You can clearly see the binocs on top when they level around and tilt until they're aimed right at you. So to answer your question, yes. Homeland Security has pictures of my bare ass on record. Your tax dollars at work. A couple of times my dog Opie would catch a scent and run right across the freaking line into Canada and I'd have to go chasing after him because there's a road right on the other side, and the little dipshit didn't have any sense whatsoever once he latched onto a fascinating aroma. He'd run into walls, fences, cars, people on the sidewalk, out into traffic, just mesmerized.                                          Sub in a short, fat stinky dog and you have the idea.So there I am again, on record as having crossed the border illegally at least two or three times, trying to keep my Opie dog from rolling in a dead Canadian possum or being creamed by a Buick with B.C plates. I could see those sensors  tracking me as I ran, too, every time. Hi there! I just thought I'd invade Canada with a farting dog!  Lock up your daughters, Huntingdon!In this day and age I don't know if these measures are necessary, are enough, or too much, or already obsolete.  I do know that this 'Constitution Free Zone' was imposed, not decided upon by the public.  I know that the public has never been given enough information about the border situation to be able to make a decision about it, too.  I live that truth every day since I've moved here. So there you go. If you have a scarier story than this? Post it. Tell me."},

It's only flavor is protein and creaminess.  (Shut up, ya filthy minded trollops.)  It's the depth of the sauce and the pungency of the other ingredient in the dish that sinks into the paneer and flavors it up, and the sum is far, far greater than the parts.As tends to happen, home-made is infinitely better than what you'd buy at the store (plus you know what's in the stuff you made.)  The difference is astounding, both in flavor and texture.  Home made is like a sliceable cloud of rich,wonderful potential. Store-bought, even the artisanal stuff, is like someone took a golf ball and beat it with a rock.  I will never buy paneer again!  And cheap? Holy crap I saved $3.00 a pound!

I have a memory like a rubber hemorrhoid doughnut.And so 'twas me that went \"Ruuh?\"  when he announced yesterday that we would be staying the weekend in Anacortes, and here I am, aniversarying my ass off, eating expensive chocolate in bed and drinking Bushmills out' the neck of the bottle, ripped to the tits on a certain schedule A substance and lolling about en dishabille in our snazzy hotel room.  It is BLISS, children.I've gone over our Anacortes holidays so many times here I won't tire you with it.  Suffice it to say that this is our ideal getaway spot and dream retirement destination.   It is what Washington State is really about.  Unlike the little red blight of Trump holdouts and fundamentalist-separatists that is the Fourth Corner where I live, this is the Washington I moved to, lo back these many years ago, back when the Stainless Steel Amazon was but a wee Stainless Steel Amazette; where everyone is tolerant, where the ages and races mix and share cultures and music and ideas, the exact opposite of what the rest of the world thinks America is like.  It was a SUCH A RELIEF to get out of lockdown, out of our house, out of Sumas, out of the Fourth Corner, and come down south into the real world again that I literally cried on the way here, I was so happy.  It also helps that it is an astounding Fall day. The sun is out, the sky is bright blue, the leaves are burning down towards Winter in every color imaginable, and all the fields are plowed and black, waiting for the rain to bless them.  Everyones gardens are glorious with the years' last flourish of color - and the home gardens here in Anacortes rival mine, and many surpass it.I look back on the bad times in our marriage and am absolutely fucking amazed that it lasted this long. You take a ferociously intelligent, German, hardass mans' man from Alaska and add a study addicted, flamboyant Bi-feminist-hippie street fighter from Portland Oregon and there's going to be an exchange of Molotov cocktails occasionally.  We've almost gotten divorced twice. Signed the papers and everything.Yup.  And yet here we are in defiance of all logic and common sense, 37 years together, having a blast, behaving badly, watching Mila Jovovitch shoot mutants on TV and joking and laughing and doing our favorite things and you know what?  This is the LARGE LIFE. We know each other better than any other person on earth, and have each others' backs because we consciously decided to do that thing.  Our marriage is so much deeper and means so much more now, compared to the days back when our relationship was based on a mutual predilection for Jaime Lee Curtis, Phillip K. Dick, motorcycles, antisocial behavior, marathon blow jobs and carbohydrates - interspersed with being pissed off at our daughter.________________________I am high as fuck. It's awesome."},

What Vancouver Island got was apocalyptic.  The seaward coast got a beating, but it was the strait between the island and the mainland that was a screaming blast channel of oh fuck no.  If I have any B.C. lurkers out there, I sincerely hope that you came through that OK and that you're doing fine.  I'm using a Canadian weather station just over the border to track my weather, because it's in the exact same microclimate that I'm in and shares the same geography.  (If you stand in the right place here in Sumas you can actually see the light on the automated data collection site just over the line.)  I followed the course of the weather all through those past two days and it was frightening to see the kind of extreme weather phenomena that Vancouver Island was taking.  The winds hit the island from the West, went south down that coast, then took an abrupt turn at it's southern end and headed straight north through the strait!  I keep thinking of all the beautiful homes and the yachts and docks that must have been at the mercy of that wind, the flying debris, the waves and the sideways rain.  That rain was hitting my house like a firehose. I hate to imagine what it was like there.  So hey, Canada, get in touch and let me know how you're doing, OK?For weather geeks: Check it out here - https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/news/article/photos-record-setting-bomb-cyclone-slams-british-columbia-pacific-northwest"},

Here, what do I do with these?'The manager shows up, smiles and chuckles and says, 'Go ahead and keep them. Once they've been out of the store I can't take them back, they'll just get surplussed.\"I look at their smiling faces, and what is the first thing that pops out of my mouth? Not 'Thank you!'

We get lots of folks coming down through the Sumas crossing to load up their cars with the stuff, so I'm usually able to feed my Jones with little effort.Today was not that day.  NOBODY has any paneer.There are two craft cheesemakers in Whatcom County who make the stuff, never mind the big companies!

The general effect that the designers seem to be going for is 'What a dead-cat hoarder would throw on to go dumpster diving'.  And the models-!  Grim anorectics without eyebrows, man and woman!  I've been all over the web looking into this trend and it's just a joke. A very bad joke. The intentional asymmetry, the intended ugliness, the absurd 'Whoopsie! This pattern looks like it's shooting out of my ass!' bullshit just eludes me.This is not to say that I'm a fashion plate by any stretch of the imagination. But then, I live in rural America and I'm 61.  We all look like bull studs from the 1970's out here, and yet our clothes are bilaterally symmetrical and don't look like they were sewn by people experiencing a psychotic break.   I've lived through some unfortunate trends, and of course there's always the extreme-o schlock that you wear for shits and giggles.

He is way more than just another '2nd tier action stud', and I'm looking at you, Mr. The Rock. Take a seat.  (Vin Diesel gets my pardon because motherfuckin' Vin Diesel.

What matters is making the action, props and backdrops look credible and all of a piece.  Aquaman is just a whole lot of no style, bad CGI, and Jason Momoa wearing jeans to swim in the ocean.  WTF jeans. You'd think being Aquaman he'd be ready to deploy at a moments' notice and always have a banana hammock on under those Wranglers, but no. Kicks off his shoes, though. How do I know so much about swimming in the ocean in jeans?  It's a thing in Oregon, where most of the beaches are gravel and there's a lot of interesting cliffs, rocks and huge piles of giant beach logs and trees and wrecks and shit to climb around on.  You don't plan on swimming, but you're near the ocean and things are slippery and covered in barnacles and old rusty spikes, and you'll probably fall off something, so you wear jeans and cheap tennies. And when you do fall in, it's not fun. It's cold, sandy, smelly and salty. You chafe and bitch for the rest of the day. So would Aquaman.What I have enjoyed lately is 'Suicide Squad' (despite the overbearing presence of Will Smiths uninteresting character,) and 'Harley Quinn - Birds of Prey.'  In fact, Birds of Prey is DC getting back to it's roots, when superheroes had a sense of humor and weren't all dismal, angsty carnage junkies in weird costumes.  Plus hot women who kick ass WITHOUT being metahuman!  About fuckin' time, DC_______________ And now a message from the 1930's!I made the mistake of trying to follow a curry recipe that I'd seen demonstrated on a cooking show.  There is no way you can make a proper curry without the right utensils, come to find out. Heretofore I'd been doing my best with a broad, shallow frying pan and making all kinds of mess, trying to strain tiny ingredients out of hot oil quickly, using a ton of paper towels, strainers and bowls, desperate for curry.                             The indignity of Curry Desperation. It isn't pretty and it isn't pleasant.After watching the nice man from India make his curry, my brain finally kicked in and I dug out my big ol' cast iron chicken fryer from about ninety-some years ago and cranked it up.  My high-sided chicken fryer with the lid was the TICKET.  Here this dude on television had been merrily straining and frying and seasoning and adding and subtracting and flipping shit around using something like a deep, high-sided wok.  Well of course he wasn't a mass of orange oil stains and onion fragments; he had a decent pan to work out of.  Once I had that chicken fryer crackin', it worked like a charm! AND I HAD CURRY!  So if you've been struggling to make curry, buy one of these beasts.You can get one new, but they're expensive -$40.00 is about midrange - and you'll have to season it in the oven about five-ten times before it's ready to use. Do you want to spend two days oiling, baking, cooling, and burnishing a seven pound mass of iron? Lid and all?  No you do not.  And no, the new ones are not pre-seasoned for sour birdshit. They're just blackened and have had a spritz of canola oil. That is not seasoning. That is a recipe for culinary disaster.  The solution?           Here is what you want.  High sides, two handles and a domed lid with a loop handle.    Get one from an antique store. They're usually cheap, because they don't display particularly well. They're already deep-seasoned, too.  All you'll have to do is wash it out and give it a couple of fresh seasonings in the oven and you're off to the races. You can use it as a Dutch Oven. You can deep fry with it on the stove top. You can even make bread in it! These damn things are handy as all get-out.As for mine? I inherited mine from my mother in law, who inherited it from her mother, so free, so HA."},

She hung around the silents so much that she attracted the notice of a moviemaker, and had been scouted to be in an early 'Kiddie Kast' movie - she was a beautiful child, too. No, she didn't get a role. Her mother forbade it, and after knowing how Shirley Temple and other child actors were treated back in those days, I'm glad.  Her and I used to watch all the old movies when they came on television, and she would even stay up with me until midnight for Sinister Cinema if they were going to play a movie with one of her favorite old time stars.  She always carried a silk handkerchief with a lipstick kiss from Colleen Moore tucked into her purse for good luck all the years I knew her.  Colleen Moore, who looked like my mothers' identical twin back when this shot was taken. She was a V A M P, vamp! She taught me about plot, film techniques, directors, different genres, she filled me in on all the Looney Toons and Merry Melody 'in' jokes and references, introduced me to old radio shows, even took me to my first live stage play - All About Eve with Don Ameche and Ann B. Davis!  She knew all the dirt, too. All that  scandalous stuff coming out about old movie stars? I already knew it all by the time I was ten.  Yes, I am that cool, thanks to her."},
{"title": "Quaint Vignettes From My Charming Rural Idyll", "date": "Saturday, October 2, 2021", "text": "I woke this morning by sitting up and announcing \"It's Waldemar!\"I don't know anyone named Waldemar.  I wasn't dreaming about anything remotely Waldemar-ish.  It is a mystery.I also learned that one cannot change channels with a cell phone; neither can one make calls with a remote.  This is a lesson that I apparently need to re-teach myself about twice a week.This afternoon, I went to visit the lady next door, who wanted some divisions.  When I knocked, I heard her say \"Go see who that is\" and a kid ran into the front room, looked at me through the glass and announced \"It's some man!\" and she replied \"Don't answer it then.\" It has been one of those days.____________________Last Monday The Biker hauled home an entire wood turning setup, from lathe to blades and everything in between, that he lucked into on Ebay.  I can't fault him for it - he got a couple of grands' worth of quality tools for $125.00.  Yeah, he had to drive to Montlake Terrace and back, but that's still a bargain even with fuel costs added.  Had he asked, I would have had him bid on this vintage Feldman-ator.    No, what I can fault him for is the fact that 1. He does not know how to turn wood 2. He has only partial use of his left hand, and 3. The garage is packed full of tools, equipment and crap already.  Fine, it's his garage and his domain, but I've had an industrial wood turning lathe in the back of my pickup for a week now and I need my pickup to go grab another load of lagoonage dammit.  Add that annoyance to the annoyance of knowing that at this very moment that man is outside trying to move the stupidly heavy thing by himself into the maw of Chaos.  Yes I offered to help. Of course he refused any help whatsoever.  He is German, after all.                                 So far I haven't heard any loud 'SPLAT' sounds, nor have I heard screaming and pleading, but I wouldn't, either.  He is German, and thus far too macho to make a 'SPLAT' sound, or scream and plead.  He would simply lie on the concrete under the lathe and feel very grouchy until he expired.  I should probably go check on him._____________________HOLY SHIT HE DID IT!I keep forgetting that The Biker has fabbed himself several moving dollies of different heights for just such purposes.  He has a chain hoist and a welding set-up (of course) and access to lots of scrap steel and punched bar stock and casters and whatnot via his job.  I needn't have worried.  But I did, and I feel better about myself for having worried, although I never did lift ass and go check to see if he was bleeding out on the garage floor.                I searched 'man crushed by machine' and this came up.  I liked this better. Here it is. The guy who put together this turning set up was a real engineer, and given that he lived in Montlake Terrace, he probably worked for Boeing.  The stand, custom rigs, and mounts are works of  great skill and mechanical know-how. It's kind of a shame that all this hard work was wasted on the dudes' son, who couldn't wait to get it off the property.  Of course the fact that the dude was so quick on the trigger that he offloaded $2000.00+ worth of quality equipment to the first bidder means that he is almost certainly a fucking idiot.  _____________________I was able to get all of my tomatoes ripe and inside this year for the very first time ever in the history of my growing tomatoes!!                                       After two weeks of dry aging in the crawlspace, naturallyThe last batch of tomatoes just got processed, and there was just enough to make a big pot of Pork Marinara.  (From a long pig, naturally.)  I had to make ground pork anyway, so I carved the meat off the bones and ran it through the grinder on my Kitchenaid, baked the bones in the oven and then into the pot full of fresh, raw tomato sauce with some garlic, olive oil, black olives, red wine and coffee;  a little oregano, a little basil, cooked for a couple hours on Low.  I was able to make a nice lunch out of the pork left on the bones once I took them out of the pot,  I've got five pounds of ground pork for sausage, half a gallon of marinara, and a nice smug feeling that makes up for being mistaken for a man by a small child this afternoon.__________________________The attic cleaners have arrived!!!!!!!!Went right to work, too.  They're up there right now making alarming noises with a ginormous industrial vacuum cleaner.  They're even running it down between the walls (gotta love balloon framing) to suck out all the antique Hantavirus.  ONE IS STOKED Y'ALL!!  Insulation next week!!!!!!!"},

Our top 40 Hit was 'Owner of a Lonely Heart' by Yes, until this song came down like dynamite! This song had them literally dancing in the street when it came out!   You heard it everywhere on The Hill.  It wouldn't be until 1991when local boys Nirvana pushed it off to the side with 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' during the height of the Grunge movement, which overlapped the post- Punk, NuDance club scene. I didn't make up those dopey genre names, btw.  That was the fault of The Rocket magazine, which was for a brief while even more prestigious than Rolling Stone here in the U.S.I had just left my first husband and moved back to Washington.  I had gone right back to my club clothes and my Bowie-Meets-Bernadette Peters look, and there I was, on Welfare, not a dime to my name, literally an outcast living amid a whole community that was also on the edge of acceptance, and this song wasn't asking anybody for acceptance; it was celebrating what it was.  That needed to happen.  People saying 'Your foot is no longer on my neck, and I'll never express myself in terms of victimhood again.'So you can probably see why it stuck in my mind.  Not only was it fun and irresistible, it was winning a kind of battle.  And face it - who doesn't like a rousing tune about butt sex?I'd always wanted one of those huge block print t-shirts, the long ones that were so fashionable in the 1980's, that had FRANKIE SAYS RELAX on it, but I felt at the time that would be going a little too far, seeing as I had an infant and was at the beck and call of the Welfare agency.  Surprise visit by your caseworker? Oh, it happened.  And had it happened go me, sure as shit,  there I'd be in my 'Frankie' t and nothing else, fighting off the cockroaches in my little railroad flat with one bathroom down the hall - unacceptable living standards by Welfare's rules right there.  Nope. Sorry, Frankie.  And so I waited until last January, in 2020, to order myself the t I'd craved for so long.  Trump was in office.  It was practically a necessity.The henbiddies in Lynden, home of Christian Separatists, homeschoolers, and the practice of Abusive Home Birth, absolutely freeze in horror when I come rocking up wearing this bad boy.  And they should.  That is the revenge that lifelong hatred enacts upon the ageing bigot.  Let them pay in anger, high blood pressure and palpitations for being shitheels.  Because they know what the lyrics to that song mean, and just knowing those lyrics is SINFUL and my t-shirt grabbed them by the throat and rubbed their noses in that meaning, right?  Ah, displaced blame.  Nothing like it.  Suffer, motherfuckers.Do you have any memories associated with this song?  Do share them, in detail, in the comments!"},
{"title": "Time!  Marches! On!", "date": "Sunday, September 26, 2021", "text": "Lord, I am so done with this remodel.  However, there is good news in the midst of my angst!  We have a stellar company coming in to clean our attic, which is an eccentric maze of old rafters, old rooflines, strange narrow runs where none should exist and birds nests the size of an exploded bale of hay, among other perils. Like critter shit. Ah, life in the country in a pre-code house.We also have the insulation company lined up and scheduled, which was a dog and pony show, let me tell ya.  There's a lot of men out there in this, the reddest corner of the bluest state in the Union, that see an older woman and get jacked full of aggression and paternalism and try and TELL you what you want.HA.   Like that is going to work on me?  Did you not see the Klingon Empire insignia on my dorklord t-shirt?                                Abandon hope! Knittin' and prayin' grannies don't wear shit like this!                     ...or like this either.  USE YOUR EYEBALLS YOU APPALLING MANCHILD!!!   The worst offender by far was one contractor  (KAZ Contracting, for anyone who lives in 'Fourth Corner' country) who came rocking up into MY house and insisted that he do the whole job, cleaning and insulation. INSISTING. That he do it, and for a laughably inflated price!  Over and over again! Each time just a little more sternly! What, I ask you, the actual fuck.  I thought he was going to plop his ass down and invite himself over for dinner.  I had to turn on that 'Mean Mom' voice and put my fists on my hips in that 'Tellin' YOU' stance, and that finally chased the idiot.  Never pass up an opportunity to exercise a little street theater, kids.Can you imagine how this dude must speak to his mother?  That attitude stems from breeding.  Dad probably spoke to women in exactly the same way.  Here's calling that shit OUT.  Just remember, the hand that rocks the cradle, cradles the rock - and also the checkbook. Just because I'm female and old doesn't mean that I'm sweet or docile.  It means that I have had many more years than you to steep in evil practices and hone my methods to perfection. I'll get you, KAZ Construction!  And your little dog!  Similarly anyone who doesn't call back on an inquiry.  I guess you don't need my cash, Chuckie, because you just wasted my time like it's cheap.  Oh this pisses me off!  It's a common courtesy for fucks' sake, and a standard business practice!  In the age of cell phones there's literally no excuse whatsoever for this shit.  You don't have a single minute to at least shoot me a text?  You're off the island, Paco. Now in other news, I've had to cut down my poor Camperdown Elm that had succumbed to a case of slime flux that engulfed the entire tree in one Summers' time.  I got it down leaves and all, and into the burn pit it went.  It's the only thing you can do when a plant is this badly - and suddenly - infected by so virulent a disease.  I was so appalled and so very sad when I discovered the extent of the problem, but when I smelled the overpowering rotten, fermented aroma that the burning wood gave off I felt like I was finally at peace with the decision.  I'm still bummed about it, though.  This was by far  my favorite plant in the whole garden.  I've wanted one since I was six, going past the Poulson House on the corner of Powell Boulevard and McLaughlin Boulevard in Portland Oregon, and seeing the fantastic specimen that lived in the front yard and crawled like a  giant carniverous spider down the steep lot toward the sidewalk.  What a lovely thing it was.This is the Poulson House as I remember it, back in the 1960's and 70's when it was painted black with pink trim!  Scary as hell, with ghosts dripping out of the windows!  The tree on the right side is the old Camperdown, and out of shot is the side of it that went down the hillside.  This place still stands and has been fully restored, but sadly the Camperdown was eliminated, which sucks.     The way you have to look at it is, now I have room for something new next year. I sulphured the trunk and the surrounding soil, and I'll let it freeze out over Winter.  Next year I'll layer it over with lagoonage and plant something extravagant - and disease resistant - in it's place.  I'm thinking a Star Magnolia.My garden is absolutely alive with bumblebees and other native pollinators!  It's like a miniature version of the movie 'The Birds' out there!  I've seen them teem to my blue asters before, but this year it's gone totally berserk.  Even the hornets are getting in on the action, next to the bumblebees, honeybees, the hoverflies, the regular flies and what have you.  The hummingbirds are absolutely enraged by all this competition and are out there swearing like sailors about this whole state of affairs.  Then in the evening the sphinx moths and hummingbird moths come and the second shift takes over, with tiny bats and ground sparrows sneaking around the flowers.        Hummingbird Moth.  Isn't it almost too perfect a disguise? They even sound like a hummingbird too!  Absolutely nuts about the color blue, in case you want to attract these wonderful little pollinators.  I can deal with most insects, bugs and arachnids.  But there's something I find distinctly icky about moths with big fat pulpy bodies, like Sphinx and Hummingbird moths; and if one gets in the house I go full on Squealing Moron, flapping and dodging and brandishing magazines trying to chase the poor confused thing back outside.  I think this comes from back when I was first riding, and in the evening the moths would hit the windshield and the visor of your helmet and leave a huge heaving splatter of icky pudding to mark the scene of their demise.  GAAAAAAAH!This is why I chase them outside instead of flattening them.  That and I'm not a monster ffs.  I know they're harmless, but they're also all...mothy.  Those of you wishing to send me moths, I'm sorry but you'll have to return them to Hell from whence they arose.  I already have enough, thanks."},
{"title": "God Make It STOP", "date": "Friday, September 17, 2021", "text": "Wherein I Bitch and Whine  Well, we didn't pass inspection.  (For those of you tuning in just now, we just had every single bit of our wiring torn out and replaced, from the least outlet to the breaker box and right out to the light pole.)  There are STRANGERS IN MY HOUSE AT RANDOM INTERVALS and they keep SHUTTING OFF MY ELECTRICITY! Thankfully we are still on warranty, because they company that did our wiring and called it done and billed has been back 4 TIMES since. Long story short, I went full-on Icy Rage Queen on that action becauseThis worked.  They got real prompt and obliging.  I mean management, of course.  The electricians were great. Still, though. Do you remember being a kid at a family gathering, and all the grownups were talking about their property taxes and lawns and their bills and leaking roofs and lot lines, and thinking \"Dear Christ just kill me now if this is how I'm going to be when I'm their age\" ?  Well, I'm their age now, and here I am, and this is the biggest thing in my life at present, and it really is just that sad and boring.Here's the way we see it:  A house is a box to keep your shit in. BOXES SHOULD NOT BE COMPLICATED! I've lived in a shed twice in my life, and I liked it just fine. One was an actual metal garden shed, just a place I slept and kept my important papers and stuff locked up. The other was a full-on Tiny House the size of a garden shed, and it rocked. (I also lived in an abandoned house for a couple of months.  I had to shit down the sewer pipe in the bathroom and then 'flush' it with a bucket of water.  Yes I've had a strange life.)The Biker feels similarly.  He lived for five years in a one-room cabin that he'd built in Alaska. It had room to park his Harley, fresh running crick water, electricity, a toilet, a fantastic view of the mountains and rivers; and the only pests were the grizzly bears that would crap next to his mail box.  Of course ours would be a lush, high-living, plumbed and insulated shed.  With solar panels. Like this:  Here it is:  The FirstNations Dream Rancho For Two!  This is not to scale; the plans are around here someplace and I'm just too lazy to look for them.  We've talked about this ever since we decided to live together. At first we put it off because we were 1. raising a kid and establishing credit, and then we put it off because 2. we were busy good-timing it up because the kid moved out, and then we put it off because 3. we wanted to money up and have a plan B in place, and now here we are, 4. twenty-some years in the same place, our separate spaces and our shared spaces established, everything about our relationship working smoothly - with contractors clomping in and out at the beginning of monsoon season.  Lesson: Be born into wealth.Well, the last electrician just walked out saying 'It's finished!' and it better BE FINISHED. It's a good thing all this was on warranty or I'd light this fucker off and watch it burn.  One is exasperated, y'all. And I still have to sort out the attic and the insulation! SHIT!"},
{"title": "Electric Boogie!!", "date": "Sunday, September 5, 2021", "text": "Finally the electricians arrived to replace ALL the wiring in our house!  One more step toward TOTAL INSULATION AT LAST!I'd always told my husband that we were running live 'knob and tube', which he did not want to hear, but then he can't get into the attic and I can, and it was pretty obvious up there since the remodeler didn't even bother to close the junction boxes.  I'm not a dumbshit ffs.Presented here on a bed of Filberts because presentation is everything.     Behold!  This is the kind of horror that was up in the attic and all over the house.  The electricians were appalled!  More importantly,  I was vindicated!  That this house ever passed inspection before being sold was probably a matter of an inspector having driven by and going 'Yeah, it's standing,' and receiving his kickback.  This shit was illegal twenty-five years ago and it's illegal today.  The company that did the remodeling is notorious around town for his shortcuts and shoddy workmanship.  We figure, what the hell, it only has to last us until we go into assisted care.  We're throwing money at it now just to stay comfortable until then, and part of staying comfortable is not waking up on fire. The kitchen and dining room are up and running, and we've been playing 'Outlet Roulette' for the past three days.  The power is glitching since we're on temporary connections until they can run new service to the house and replace the master fuse box. Where is the fusebox?  Why, in my bedroom!  HUZZAH!Still, the outfit we hired is really banging it out in record time.  Most importantly, they're running the lines through the attic instead of under the floor joists.  We flood, and it's only going to get worse over time, so we're planning ahead for the time when the floodwaters reach the actual structure.  Here's hoping that never happens, at least while we're in residence. I have made many discoveries and had many core realizations during all this activity.  I discovered that a family of Gods' little creatures was living in my kitchen by hearing the sounds of an electrician gagging when they moved the counter out from the wall.  That was embarrassing as hell.  I did a record time deep-clean on that and apologized profusely.  I discovered that we own entirely too many tchotkes.  Entirely. Too. Many. And I discovered that all our furniture is really heavy, too.  That's the tradeoff for owning original Mid-Century Modern pieces because we are super cool and trendy here at Rancho FirstNations.  Yes I am bragging.Core realizations?  I am not the housekeeper I used to be.  I used to be, as one woman noted years ago, The Hippie Martha Stewart.  I was very exacting about order and cleanliness.  Now, the combination of being really short and having crappy glasses has resulted in accumulations of crud that I simply didn't see until I had to move things around.  The stuff in my linen closet is aligned with geometric precision, but spiders, mice, and wildfire soot have added to the overall state of entropy despite that crucial detail.Another core realization was that I have internalized the tenor of my social environment to the point of going to the trouble of hiding certain things from the gaze of the electricians, such as my copies of  The Autobiography of Aleister Crowley, Witchcraft In Europe, and the Malleus Malificarum.  Every one of these guys live here in town, and I'd rather be known for my garden than I would be for my reading material. (I have actually had problems with this before, when one of my daughters' friends told her mother what I had on my shelves and her mother forbid the kid from ever visiting again. Yeah.  We have well over a thousand books in our collection, most of it non-fiction, but no - the kid zeroed right in on the three eeeeeeevil titles and narked to her mom. The rumor went all over the school and straight to the parents: SSA's mom and dad are Satanists!!! which we are not.  Still, thanks, ya little shit.)Still, as much of a nuisance as all this is, I am very happy despite my bitching and whining. We won't have nearly as many power dips and surges as we have had for years, and the likelihood of death by rodent - assisted fire will be greatly reduced.  Then the insulation will go in!! This Winter isn't going to be anywhere  near as hard as last Winter was.  I'm really looking forward to that!  And similarly, next Summer isn't going to be as rough, either.  My house will be a refuge from the weather instead of being at the weathers' mercy!  Imagine it!"},

At first it was a positive thing...for a short (and rather confusing) time, she went from being God's miserable hemorrhoid to being Jesus ' little sunbeam. Was this my mother? Smiling?  Happy?  Not calling me a whore?Well, that didn't last long, that smiling, that 'I must be a living Witness for the Word, I must present the best possible face to the world' stuff.  It took about a year for the vicious harpy I'd known all my life to sneak back into the picture, a cigarette here, a drink there, cruel remarks  when I was the only one listening, that would be denied if mentioned.  The only lasting change in her after all was said and done was that she would sprinkle the phrase 'Praise the Lord' into her conversation.I moved out late in 1978.  My former bedroom was taken over instantly by my mother to become what she termed 'a study'. By that time her pious horseshit had moved from the 'Jesus loves you happy rapture' stage to the 'blaming and shaming, Bible thumpin', Satan is everywhere' stage.  I knew what was coming next, and got the FUCK out of Dodge one month after I came of age.  Jump forward three years.I had come to visit, to introduce the Biker to my parents.  He got the whole house tour.  I followed along closely because I had a feeling there would be things I'd have to explain to him later.  Turns out I was right.My old bedroom was the last stop on the tour.  Oh, I had those forebodings of doom real good by then.  My mom was grinning at me, her eyes filled with vindictive glee as she literally threw open the door.It was filled to the ceiling. 'Well', I thought, 'I expected that. The woman is a hoarder.'But at second glance I realized that my former room was now filled to overflowing, from floor to ceiling, only a narrow path from the door to the desk, with religious things - and only religious things.-Religious posters, banners, framed saints, and holy cards were taped to every wall, behind all the other crap.-Bibles - not singular, plural - were stacked. Each one was a different edition. None of them had ever been opened. -Concordances, study guides, cassette tape courses by every charlatan in the Jesus game - remember how those cassette courses came in big binders? - towered along one wall.-Devotional statues in abundance, to the point it resembled a Santeria chapel. Collect 'em all!  -A holy water stoup that was also a switchplate, with Jesus and his bleeding heart above the switch, and the little cup beneath it.  It was covered in crystal glitter and glowed in the dark.-Boxes and boxes and boxes and piles and rubber banded clumps of religious tracts, magazines, and Christian books up to the ceiling and out into the room.-Rosaries, scapulars, plaited palm fronds, and other Catholic home accents.  Basically everything in this catalogue: Seriously, hit the link.  You'll be...amazed.  Yeah, that's a good adjective.  Amazed.https://catholicshop.com/catholic-catalog.  There it was. The most insane, over the top collection of Christ-related articles all thrown together in one completely un-used, stale little dusty, stuffy, cobwebbed room where the curtains were clothes-pinned shut.And topping it all off was the Crucifix of Doom.This was a full on, 'bleeding Jesus' Catholic crucifix, really a rather beautifully executed thing, and that easily enough judged for its being FOUR FREAKING FEET TALL.Where does a layperson even find a thing like that?If you've ever seen a life-sized waxwork statue of the Agony of Christ, or ever been in the Church of St. Michael the Archangel in Tijuana, then you know exactly the type of over-the-top, S and M, eerily lifelike - special effects realism I mean.And there it was in my room. Bleeding. A lot.  Christ in his last agonies, nothing spared.I have never.NEVER....been so taken aback in my life. I mean I literally did take a step back in horror. I was scared, and I was appalled.And she laughed at me.The Biker didn't get it.  This was something tailored entirely for me to experience.  He didn't get it because he wasn't meant to get it.  Her meaning was absolutely clear to me, though, and that's why she stood there laughing at my reaction. I'd grown up with the woman and I knew how she thought. She had 'exorcised' me from her house and her life. My evil, filthy, stinking, dirty, whorish presence - all epithets that I regularly heard applied to me for 18 years - had been utterly cleansed from that space and her life by filling it with a massive shitpile of God.  This was a hate installation, and I was the targeted audience. \"Now whaddya thinka that?\" she laughed. \"Oh!  You should see ya face!  Whaddya think of that, now?  Go in!  Take a look!\"  Just laughing.We declined.That was the last time I ever visited them.  Two years later I had to cut them completely out of my life, both parents, for a whole slew of creepy, abusive reasons I won't go into.I'd done my best to prepare the Biker for what he was likely to see.  He has a fair amount of crazy in his family; alcoholics, hoarders, bulemics; child abuse, drug abuse, crime - you know, a typical American family - but what he saw that day went entirely outside his experience.  He got that it was weird.  What he didn't get was the sheer malice behind it.  And who expects malice presented in the form of Blessed Jesus, meek and mild?  That was a level of mindfuck that it took him years to understand. So anyway, there's my little bedtime story.  But take heart - she died years ago.  You could probably summon her up with a Ouija Board, but don't blame me for what happens next."},
{"title": "Barbecue Decks and Magic Charms", "date": "Saturday, August 21, 2021", "text": "Now that the heat has broken I am up off the couch, the fans no longer run in multiples all over the house and I am able to go outside and actually do chores, which my ass appreciates because I don't have much of an ass, and so sitting on what I don't have all day long ends up being a literal pain in the ass.  It's like I have a pair of elbows back there instead of nalgas.  Being up and around is infinitely better than just sitting on a cold gel pack watching YouTube.  This is one of those weird things they don't tell you about getting old.  You get assless.  And I was no bass star to begin with.So I've been outside working in the yard and doing errands and minor household repairs, puttering, which I love.  Just dipshitting around doing all the little necessary things.  And a few big things too, like cutting out a couple of trees and hauling in a few loads of nice, dry lagoonage before monsoon season arrives and getting that spread around.  Doing some touch-up work on the house paint.  Repairing the barbecue deck. We have a barbecue deck made out of machine grade oak boards that's finally giving up the ghost after 18 years, and that's not bad for a free deck that the Biker made out of huge oak shipping crates made for carrying sheet steel blanks.  I've been repairing it with old license plates, and it looks pretty kewell.  You end up with lots of old license plates when you're married to a motorhead. He throws them away, I fish them out of the shop trash and we have the most awesome barbecue deck going.  I am convinced that the barbecue deck is the male version of the She Shed.  It is it's own whole sub-deck one step down off our main patio deck specifically for outdoor cooking purposes, with a  wood grill, a smoker, a propane grill and a utility cabinet-worktop.  It gets used all the time, and it's a two-man setup. I did not know this was a man thing, but apparently it is.  His buddies come over with large chunks of raw cow or what have you and they all set food on fire outside together.  This deck has seen a lot of testosterone, beer and grease.  And license plates.___________________I have a shed, and I'm a she, technically, but my shed is full of power tools and various cutting implements powered by gasoline.  And saws and shovels and, you know, yard shit.  Tomato cages and flower pots and stuff. Tarps.  And a bit of pagan symbolism to draw in the fertile and creative properties of the universe.  Come to that, I went around a couple of days ago and took a look at all the 'good luck' stuff I have around.  Horseshoes with nails over the doorways to chase off what needs chasing, a couple of giant fish hooks jammed into the wood next to the door (This is an old Finnish thing that my grandparents had and meant that you'd never go hungry.) I have 'hand of blessing' doorway charms, and I have a few ring rocks here and there just in case.  I painted the ceiling of my front porch blue, which is a sure way of keeping out haints and demons and the influence of the evil eye and general badness.  The blue porch ceiling was another thing that my grandparents had.  My grandmother painted it over when she converted to Seventh Day, but she never took down the horseshoes or the fish hooks, oh hell no.  Or the scythes.  You want to scare some bad shit, and you were raised rural and German, you put a Grim Reaper scythe up on your house.  She had three!  They were out on the back porch where they used to entertain company; all mixed in with misery whip sawblades and ox bows and elk antlers and cart wheels and all that kind of stuff like you used to see on older peoples houses or barns, old hand forged tools and signs and so forth. But those three scythes were meant for purposes other than rustic ornament. NOTHING was gonna get past those things. Now my mother was all about the holy medals and crucifixes and light switch plates with Jesus on them that glowed in the dark.  Every single doorway had a holy medal over it. Crucifixes in every room, including the garage and the basement. By the time I moved out Jesus had pretty much taken over the place, so at least she had a spare room to put him up in.  (And she did.  Oh boy, did she ever.  Ask me nice and I might re-run that story for you.)It's funny how you might not quite believe in it, but it makes you feel better having those things there just in case.  Does my little tribute to celestial influences out in the shed make my garden grow better?  Do the fish hooks keep us in groceries?  Does the blue porch roof really repel evil?Maybe not.  But maybe so.  And maybe is where magic lives."},
{"title": "WARNING:  Gardening Post", "date": "Friday, August 20, 2021", "text": "Tomatoes!!Tomatoes, tomatoes, tomatoes!!      I have grown every single tomato in this picture.  I'm basically awesome.  This years' varieties were Black Prince, which is a saladette-sized tomato with a purpley-brick to mahogany color, and Early Beefsteak, which I suspect is held by Monsanto, but don't quote me on that.The 'Early' line throw fruits which are red and round and apple sized on big, sturdy plants.  In the past I've grown Early Girl, Earlier Girl, and Early Boy.  All of them were disappointments in this climate.  They were prone to crack and blossom end rot, and didn't set a very robust root system, even though I practice deep setting, (where you strip off all the lower leaves and leave four on the very top and then plant the whole stem, leaving the leaves above soil level of course.)  They produced an average tomato, on the watery side, with a lot of seeds and very little 'meat' - and what was there wasn't firm at all.Early Beefsteak, however, is an entirely different beast.  I have softball sized tomatoes out there on a beast of a plant with a root system like a fuckin' willow.  The fruit is solid, firm, with lots of meat, scarlet all the way through, and not at all watery. The flavor can become very sweet very quickly, and one day is the difference between tomato flavor and just too damn ketchuppy, so you pick them when they're firm and then let them go another day on the windowsill.  It is great when cooked. There are very few seed cells, and that's not by chance.  Big Seed Inc. does not want you saving those seeds and planting them for free next year.  I don't regret having grown it for an instant.  I am saving time on processing with these big old hummers, and they fit the bill.I've grown Black Prince before.  Nothing about it is beautiful.  The plant is rangy and the root system is shallow. The leaves curl in the sun and get spotty in the shade.  The fruits will crack just from a heavy dewfall. They split, catface, grow odd protrusions and look ugly. Some will actually turn coal black; most don't. You cannot tell a ripe one from an unripe one because they generally come in all different shades of a color best described as 'Old Worn Out Brown Carpeting With Green Parts.  You have to go in and squeeze them and then pick the ones that give a little, once they've started to color up. They have a hide like a rhino, are more juice than meat and full of seeds.  Why do I grow it?Because it tastes like the very soul of a tomato, astoundingly fine, and never varies.  I grow it to up the ante on whatever else I've got growing, because sometimes I'll pick a real loser (like 'Taxicab', a screamin' yellow tomato, which, while novel, was basically just a characterless, bland saladette that was half water.)  I like to grow a good, solid, big tomato for slicing into big ol' slabs and putting on burgers, sandwiches, or frying in olive oil and eating with a little salt. Early Beefsteak, Cherokee Purple and Brandywine all fit the bill. But mostly, I sauce and freeze my tomatoes.Now, you take Black Prince and mix it with a Brandywine or Cherokee Purple, you've got Heaven.  Mixed with my Early Beefsteak, it brought a utility tomato up to excellence. When I sauce tomatoes, I just seed them, run them through the food processor, and then bake the slurry at 275f in a 9 by 13 pan (or the next size smaller depending on how much I have, or even multiple pans on the racks) until I can smell them in the front room - at about the 45 minute mark - and then I stir it and let it go a little more until it's reduced by a third. I might give it another stir if I feel like it. With all that surface area exposed to the dry heat, this process goes fairly quickly, even with multiple pans.  Then I cool it and freeze it and done. Boom. Takes about three hours, no matter how full the oven is.  Why not reduce it on the stovetop? Because in the oven,  you don't get flies committing suicide in your sauce.   Yes I've tried a spatter screen.  You have to weight it down with silverware to keep the flies out because rural flies are some weight-lifting little fuckers and will fight their way into that hot tomato sauce to die. You also have to stir your sauce A Lot on the stovetop to keep it from scorching on the bottom even on the lowest setting because of all the natural sugars = spending five hours running in and out of a hot kitchen in late Summer because you're working with a deep pot with poor evaporation properties = NO.   Then when it's all done, you've got a dirty pot and spoon and auxiliary silverware, and the screen is all gunked up with syrupy condensate and you have to soak it in hot water and Dawn and scrub it with a brush and seriously fuck that.Reducing it slowly in a wide, flat pan in the oven also carmelizes the top of the sauce just a bit, so that when you stir it, all the flavor gets deepened without getting scorched. This is THE way to sauce tomatoes, hands down.  Took me a lot of years to figure this out, and look at you, getting the benefit of my culinary wisdom for free, you lucky people.What I am making here is an ingredient, not a final product.  That's why I don't use anything but tomatoes in my sauce.  I can thaw some out and jump in any direction from that point, and I always know exactly what flavor to expect.  This kind of plain tomato sauce is EXQUISITE in Indian dishes, and in a minestrone soup it is to die for!  Cream of tomato soup, beef stew, you name it - it even makes a fantastic 'Frappe Style' Bloody Mary!  It's a perfect way to control flavors, and it doesn't have that canned taste.So, there's that.  No, you can't have any of mine."},
{"title": "They're Heeeeeeeeere", "date": "Saturday, August 14, 2021", "text": "And just who are they?  Asian motherfucking murder hornets.  They just found the first live nest in Blaine, Washington, which is entirely too close to where I live.Story here: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/first-live-murder-hornet-of-2021-seen-in-washington-state-11628870714Picture here:What exactly did this thing evolve to kill?  Water buffalo?  Why does this even exist???   Murder hornets don't murder people. They murder wasps and honeybees. Now me, I'd have a fuckin' heart attack if I saw one because they're the size of a goddamn field mouse, no lie; and scaring old ladies to death is manslaughter in my book.  Canada is doing it's part in eradicating them, and a hearty THANK YOU, CANADA for that.  But us?  It's complicated by the fact that up here in the Fourth Corner, there are Vast Tracts O' Land all along the border that are uninhabited. One the opposite side of the border, literally the width of a two lane road that is called, oddly enough, Boundary Road, it's pretty well suburbs and well-managed farms, right up to the line, but on this side it's forests, hillsides, and open fields.    The person who found the murder hornet here seems to have found it up underneath an overturned boat, from the photographs.  Blaine is a town on Puget Sound, and it has a fair sized population, but not everyone in Blaine is poking around underneath boats looking for murder hornets either.  I say GET ON THE FUCKING JOB, BLAINE.I've done my part and have ever since the first mention of the issue.  I have also laid in a stock of wasp and hornet killer. I am not ashamed to use chemical warfare on these things.  Hornets are aggressive!  They will literally come after you for no good reason and sting you just to be assholes.  They'll even bite a chunk out of you!  No shit.  It's happened to me, I saw it happen to my husband, they will literally take a bite out of you and leave a bleeding hole, particularly if you've been sweating.  But stinging isn't good enough for them.  Blind rage isn't enough. Having a whole town in Washington named after them isn't enough. (Twisp, Washington - onomatopoeically named for the sound that hornets make flying in a swarm, which they do like mad bastards there in Twisp.) Flying isn't enough. They are insane flying megalomaniacs, and if they don't get you, their big brother WILL.Native hornets do have their place in the grand scheme. They are pollinators. Yes!  And the wilderness would be tit deep in dead animals and deer shit and bear crap and old rotten trees without hornets.  Ever wondered why the forest is such a tidy place?  Hornets.  Then people came along and started building boats and turning them over and providing hornets with predator-free areas to build their nests. The murder hornet in Blaine was found snacking on a regular hornets nest up underneath that boat.  I don't know who to root for in that situation.In the wilderness, hornets are kept in line.  They're basically snacks once the sun goes down.  They go dormant and just cluster up on on the outside of their nests.  A pine marten or squirrel or what have you comes along and gets a crunchy late night snack, like the wilderness version of ghost pepper Doritos, I guess. There are no pine martens here at Rancho FirstNations, and damn few squirrels.  We get regular sized hornet nests in the eaves of the garage, in our cars up under the sheet metal (which is demented but who can divine the purposes of these fuckin' things?) and in our TWO SHEDS. Yes.  We have TWO SHEDS. Insert Monty Python jokes here!  TWO SHEDS BABY!!  RANCHO 'TWO SHEDS' FIRSTNATIONS!! SHEDS SHEDS SHEDS!  IT'S SHED MADNESS!!!!!!!!!Where was I.  Oh. Hornets.  So we get hornet nests, and we destroy hornet nests, and they build them again, and we destroy them again.  Come August, you better have destroyed those hornet nests and cleared them away completely, because something about the month of August really pisses hornets off .  I don't know why it is, but it is, and it's a damn fact.  They are everywhere and they are all in an insane rage about something. Now supersize all those propensities.You got you a Murder Hornet, Paco.  They have a stinger that is 1/4 inch long and they can SPRAY poison out of that stinger if just stinging the fuck out of you hasn't made enough of an impression, and they can sting your ass multiple times and just fly off laughing.  The venom can cause kidney failure, and does cause your tissues to break down and liquify at the sting site, which is utterly horrible. They hunt in packs. Yes! And they live underground, taking over old rodent holes, like rat, mole and vole runs.  So now, I get to go around hunting up critter holes and vole runs and plugging those, which I've added to my gardening routine.I've been stung by a ground wasp, which has the same kind of venom, just in a vastly smaller dose.  Now a ground wasp is a tiny, sad little excuse for a wasp the size of a house fly, but that sting raised a welt that spread all around my ankle and turned mushy, and then just kind of sloughed for a few weeks, which was not beautiful or appropriate. And it itched.  A murder wasp sting feels like having a hot nail driven into your leg.  Plus, you lose immune response the more times you're stung, per Wikipedia. 1. Who is out there in Asia dicking with the murder hornets and getting stung so many different times that they're losing immune response? 2. Presumably the people who go out and harvest the fucking things to be fried and eaten, because hey, let's eat it before it eats us.  I can kind of get with that sentiment, but I'd also be wearing a Kevlar suit while I did it, and I am in no hurry to apply for that job, so there's that too.Here's another reason to police those little hornet nests you find around.  Murder hornets?  The big fuckers?  They scent-mark.  They go around scent-marking hornet and honeybee nests, and then they come back later in a pack when they're hungry and eat them ALL.  Having regular hornets flying around being assholes is one thing.  Leaving up multiple hornet nests, empty or not, with MURDER HORNET SCENT TAGS on them is tantamount to standing on the roof of your car and screaming  'Come sting the fuck out of me, vast murderous hornets, and then feast on my remains!'.As if this weren't enough to stress my shit, Canada is on fire again, and we're in the middle of a heatwave/drought.  I wake up to the smell of smoke, the sky is yellow, everything an acre distant is buried in haze, and there is not a breath of wind.  Oddly, it's also incredibly humid, so after the sun goes down and the dew falls, it smells like an old rotten cellar hole outside.  Like the kind you find in the dank woods that has a gross puddle in one end?  That cellar hole. That smell.  I've been getting up early and doing all my outside work in the morning, when it's cooler.  I just speed - trimmed my umbrella alder this morning, trying to beat the heat, and the kid next door learned a lot of new swear words in English from me as I went around with the hedge trimmers, clippers and loppers like a maniac. That was at 7:00.  By nine in the morning it was 80f, and it's 86f now, which amounts to 30C and too goddamn hot everywhere else in the world. Not a breeze.What do I have instead of a breeze?  The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in my driveway, bugging The Biker, roaming around like this is a public park, wanting to go in the garage and play with the air compressor.  The Biker finally chased them off.  Five minutes later one comes back and stands outside yelling 'Hey!' at the house for a few minutes.  What is up with this?  When you were a kid, did you go around bothering random old people?  No!  You avoided them because they would smack you with their canes and yell at you in Norwegian.Right now I'm inside with the fans going and quilts nailed over the windows to keep out the heat, which works surprisingly well.  It's pretty pleasant in here.  I've got my kim chee going and there's tomatoes being processed, and I'm feeling like I accomplished something, which is nice, because I intend to spend the rest of the day doing exactly nothing.  And so should you.  Unless you live in Whatcom County.  Then you should go outside and clear all your damn hornet nests. The life you save may be your own, but more importantly, MINE."},
{"title": "Rancho Recipe:  Kim Chee!", "date": "Thursday, August 12, 2021", "text": "One of my favorite things in the entire world to eat is Napa kim chee. It is DELICIOUS.  I go through the stuff like a buzz saw.  It's my breakfast of choice, in fact.  Kim chee over rice with a little sesame oil.  That'll put lead in your pencil, boy. It is among one of the top healthiest things in the world to eat, too. Look it up!  But the problem is, the stuff is expensive.  So I goes online, I does, and I looked up recipes.  Come to find out, making napa kim chee is absolutely dead simple and need not involve the use of vast crocks and burying things for a year and all that. No!  You can make it in your kitchen!  No cooking involved! The core process is soaking room temperature, bruised napa cabbage in just enough room temperature salt water to cover it for about four hours, or overnight, doesn't matter.  The salt, the water, and the compounds and natural bacteria found in the cabbage mix and create what's called a lacto fermentation.  How? The salt kills harmful bacteria but not the benign ones, and those benign bacteria produce not alcohol, but lactic acid.  It's that lactic acid that pickles the ingredients.  You get that process started and it's off to the races! First and foremost:  Do let's start out with clean hands and utensils, and do rinse off your ingredients too.  Unless you like botulism.  Do you like botulism? No. Nobody likes botulism.Now the following is all 'to taste', and take into consideration the fact that I'm the only one in the house who eats the stuff.  I make it in small batches, and it lasts me about, eh, two weeks if I'm being conservative.The salt water should be as salty as the sea.  Please don't use sal gris or himalayan pink salt because those products are not pure.  Ideally, use kosher salt.  I like the 'Diamond Crystal' brand.  Iodized is fine. Smoked is also fine. The idea is, you don't want dirt (pink Himalayan is full of clay) or seagull shit and fish assholes (sal gris) in your kim chee.   My particular taste is more cabbage than anything else, so I use a smallish head of napa as big around as a magnum bottle of wine (how's that for a measurement?), four red radishes,  two tablespoons of crushed garlic, one teaspoon of crushed ginger, one cup of cut scallion greens, a healthy few glugs of fish sauce and about 1 tbl of oyster sauce, or less.  I use two heaping tablespoons of Nanami Togarashi spice, and once it's all mashed together and packed I end up with about a half-gallon of kim chee.  Now to get things happening, you chop the head of Napa in half. (This is to help keep the ingredients all in a bunch and submerged than it is aimed at end use, when you'll cut it into bite size with a scissors.)  Use the core too, removed and sliced fine.  Put it in enough salt water to just cover it.Now, scrunch the cabbage around in the salt water with your bare hands until it gets soft. Spend a couple of minutes really squishing this stuff. Put a cheesecloth or a splatter guard over the bowl to keep out flies, roaches, hippies and what have you.  Then walk away and find something to keep you busy for the next four hours (or overnight, doesn't matter.)   The salt water and the cabbage juices and natural cabbage bacteria all start doing their thing and lactic acid begins to be created.  Once it starts, it doesn't stop, although it will slow down to almost nothing after being chilled in the refrigerator.After this initial soaking, strain out the cabbage into a bowl - but keep that salty water handy - and add the rest of the ingredients to the cabbage, which will now be very flubby and glossy.Squish the ingredients together in a bowl to make the juices flow. Use your hands, gloved or not, or use a potato masher and a spoon and turn it over and around and just really mistreat it for awhile. Don't make a paste out of it, let the ingredients keep their structural integrity, but get them juices flowing!  Now pack it all in a jar, a Tupperware, what have you, and pack it in tight.  No air bubbles. Tip in a little of the salt water, tap the container on the counter until there's no bubbles coming to the surface, squish it down and then put a plate, or pickling weights, or whatever you can on top of that, and then top it up with the leftover salt water until it covers the ingredients by an inch. The idea is to keep as much of the vegetation underwater as you can, though naturally a few bits will escape (and you will throw those away, because they'll spoil the batch.) Leave some 'head room' in the container, about an inch or two between the lid and the contents. With the weights in place, put the lid on very loosely, set the container in a bowl out of the way, at room temperature - not in the blazing sunlight, of course,  and wait three days.  Some liquid might burble out due to the fermentation process. I've never had this happen, but my daughter, who makes it in huge batches, has. Wipe that up with a clean, dry paper towel (no soap!) if that needs to happen.  Three days later, tighten down the lid, and put the container and the bowl it's in into the refrigerator, and there you go. Done! Ready to eat once chilled!Now you're worrying about botulism and salmonella.  Me, I'm assuming you rinsed off your vegetables and you have a clean workspace.  That being the case, lactic fermentation is pretty safe.  You're working with an acid, after all, (lactic acid!) and like vinegar, also an acid, also used to pickle, it kills the 'bad' bacteria, and only the acid producing organisms survive.  Like anything that's been canned or pickled, once you open it, put it right back in the refrigerator.  If you don't, then you're courting trouble.  Otherwise, be neat and clean and you'll be OK.And you'll have kim chee!"},
{"title": "Muk At The Movies:  Skyline, Beyond Skyline", "date": "Saturday, July 31, 2021", "text": "A truly entertaining movie must have several key elements:  Kung Fu, robots, spaceships, aliens, strong female leads, an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope, freaky eyeballs, Liam Neeson, massive metric shit-tons of CGI, aliens, robots, and robots.While the 'Skyline' franchise is notable in its lack of Liam Neeson and an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope, it has everything else.  No plot to speak of, average acting, serious continuity issues and really iffy writing, but seriously who cares.  It is the best 'evil invading aliens' movie since E.T.   But where E.T. has to be carried around in a bicycle basket to wreak his malign will on an unsuspecting world, the aliens in Skyline have a biomechanical mothership the size of the town I live in and uglier than the one the Romulan mining crew was tooling around in during the first Star Trek re-boot.  I mean this thing is all black and spidery and pointy and dangly and, and, with all tentacles, and strange lights, and writhing wormy thingies and long clawlike structures, ominous and floaty and generally just a flying myocardial infarction, an 'OMFG RUN, I am pretty sure they don't mean us well, HIDE NOW' kind of evil alien spaceship.  Seriously, it's the best evil alien spacecraft in decades of moviemaking! I am STOKED on this thing!  So the outside of the mothership is freaky-scary, right, I've established that; but the inside is absolutely revolting.  It's disgusting-scary, which makes it even better.  Nobody has cleaned a thing in this spaceship in a long, long time.  Things have been let go. It's not all techno and weapony looking, it's all dark and rotted and insecty and diseased looking. In a phrase, like the medicam video taken during Satans' last colorectal exam. Oh heck, I'll indulge myself here.Take the liquified contents of a freezer found in an abandoned house plus the contents of a seafood warehouse where the power has been out for a month, and a big pit full of corpses past their expiration date.  Supersize that. Dump it all in a heap, surround and invade it with jagged metal walls, strakes, spikes and gantries, throw in some holograms and energy beams - and then run a bunch of vaguely insectile mega - chambers and passages throughout that heap of gak with no thought for ease of use or uniformity, AND THEN populate the whole motherfucker with random hovering tentacled biodrones that look like fish guts mixed with spiders and windshield wipers and have multiple freaky eyeballs! All those things do is just float around the ship looking for intruders - no spoilers, but they like intruders. In a 'let me just harvest some of  your parts' kind of way.Now, 'Skyline' is just a group of people in a large city running and hiding. But they have a lot to run from, because these aliens are really dedicated to their takeover agenda.   They deploy all different types of shit on our asses.  Large seeker craft, small drone flyer spies, capture/harvester organisms,  scrambly crawly stabby things and more, and every single one of them have multiple freaky eyeballs, tentacles, pointy stabby parts, dangly intestine thingies, ovipositors, machine arms, mechanical parts, antigravity fields and a compulsor-beam with the ability to make you get freaky eyeballs too! Skyline is a B movie with (a staggering amount of flaws, actually) two major flaws - a romance subplot, and the fact that it ends on a really weird, unexpected note. Which is fine.  We can't all be ballerinas, Brenda.  But wait!  There's a sequel that will explain that weird ending.  The thing that both these movies have that most science fiction doesn't are some really odd plot decisions and twists that you just don't find in sci fi. It could be a result of poor writing, it could be the result of writing by committee, or making it up as they went along.  What was clearly a weakness turned out, oddly, to be the thing that made them stand out from the pack for me. Beyond Skyline takes us rather abruptly from Los Angeles to Laos.  Why Laos?  Because why the fuck not Laos, dammit.  And once they get to Laos, as you might expect, the kung fu gets rippin' because we are in The East and that's what happens. There are some red hot kung fu sequences, too; fast, fluid, vicious, and precise.   And remember, we are still dealing with all the alien technology we met and were freaked out by in the first movie, but with  MORE BUDGET SPENT.  You get a whole tour of the mothership, which is frankly a horrific unsanitary place that desperately needs a good hosing down. Every new space is grosser or weirder or more mysterious than the last, but it's incredible too.  This ship is clearly more than half alive.   And that's what I like best about these two movies.  Someone had an incredible vision here and they were let loose and ran butt-wild on it.  It all looks truly, genuinely ALIEN.  (And those sets must have been a bastard to try and film inside of too, because there is a lot of yech going on.)  It manages to be technological and biological and utterly alien throughout - a triumph of some twisted souls' imagination.  No otherworldly spacecraft has ever been more freaky, frightening, and absolutely not of this world since the one in, well, Alien (RIP HR Giger)The other thing I like about these two movies is that you get to go up close and personal with the aliens.  You see inside their ship, you see their methods, you get a real good idea of why they're here and what they want - but not everything is explained because it's too damn alien to explain!  You see what I'm getting at here?  These are aliens!  Why do they have a room full of dangling egg sacs full of icky squealing things and jagged girders? Because they're ALIENS! Why does one battle cybersuit look like Independence Day and the other one look like Cthulhu?  Because they're ALIENS! Their sense of decorating and standards of cleanliness and where to stick a sudden chitinous air shaft decorated with hula fringe and dangling bodies is the product of ALIEN THOUGHT PROCESSES.Again, the acting is average, the script is really average, the budget went into sets and effects and that's entirely OK. It didn't have a romance subplot, which is a plus in my book, because who cares about romance in the middle of an alien goddamn invasion?   It's all about the action/horror here.  Neither of these movies are the best science fiction movie you will ever see in your life, but they will be among the most entertaining trashy science fiction movies you've ever seen, two excellent guilty pleasures. Think Roger Corman with more money, modern technology and a smidge more taste.So. My ratings, on a scale of 1 being shitty and 10 being excellent:Kung Fu - 10 Spaceship - 10+Aliens: 10 Strong female leads - 5An almost fanatical devotion to the Pope - 1 Freaky eyeballs - 10 Liam Neeson - 1 Massive metric shit-tons of CGI - 10  Robots - 10Muk At The Movies rates Skyline and Beyond Skyline as MUST SEE NOW._______________________________Not ONE of of you better say 'Oh, I don't do crappy space movies because they make me spill my Earl Grey and I have sophisticated adult tastes and read Herman Hesse and do the New York Times Crossword puzzle in pen' because you need to pull the stick out, people.  A life spent without indulging in some pure, dumb fun is too grim to imagine.  Plus freaky eyeballs."},

And this kind of exchange took place about seven or eight times in rapid succession, and I was thinking 'Oh God, I've been riding in the truck all day with the windows rolled down and I have crazy cat lady hair' until glance number eight (or nine) landed on my shirt, and I busted her fair and square just glaring.  Then she realized the bust and turned her back on me completely.  Did I do the dance of my people on my way out to the parking lot?  I did! Oh yeah I did!Really, this is how ridiculous it gets here in the Reddest Corner of the Bluest State.  This woman's face was just contorted in distaste. Just glaring at my shirt, and her lips just all pinched up like a butthole. Which was in keeping with the theme, but come on.  ________________________________I was riding my bike around this morning when I crossed over the small pedestrian bridge we have over the creek that runs through town, and there in the low water below I saw something colorful.Now my first thought always goes to 'human body parts' because I grew up in Portland Oregon where that kind of thing is something of a tradition.  But as I looked carefully into the water, the upside-down image resolved itself in my mind's eye, and I found myself looking at a very nicely done statue of Ganesh.This is not what you expect to find in a rural creek.  You expect old shopping carts and tires and body parts, not lovely painted statues of Hindu elephant gods.My second thought was an outraged 'That doesn't belong there!' and I imagined that someone had picked it up at a garage sale and then threw it off the bridge just to be a dick. I had ideas of fishing it out and bringing it home, too, because, frankly, it's a very pretty statue.Ah, but then I had the presence of mind to Google it, and sure enough, there is a tradition of immersing statues of Ganesh during a particular festival in August,  just as some people throw holy medals or statues into wells in the Catholic tradition.  (My upbringing comes in handy at the strangest times, y'know?  I never would have thought of that had I not been raised Cat'lick.) I'm glad I did, too, because I would have gladly donned my barn boots and gone wading after that statue and disrespected one of my neighbors' traditions, not to mention their religious figure.My third thought was 'Wow, the water is really super clean here.  I could see every single rock on the bottom!'"},

WATCH IT HARD. WATCH IT NOW BABY NOW!!The rest?  Asylum?  FUCK DAT.  There is no way in hell that my mentally ill ass is watching 'Asylum'.  'One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest' was rough enough for me.  This shit?  This Dr. Chenard, House on Haunted Hill - messed up nasty medical shit? No, buddy.\"Murder House\"? Yawn.\"Cult\"?  Been there, done that, it wasn't entertaining.The rest?  Kids, I said 'Life is too short.'You start to notice repeat themes.  The 'stabbing someone 300 times, and doing so like a Dunking Duck on high speed' scene.  The 'group of people chopping and stabbing the fuck out of someone like a Dunking Duck on high' speed scene. The 'barfing' scene. (People are just upchucking all over the place in American Horror Story.  I promise you there is not that much barfing going on in America.)  The 'group sex' scene. The 'horrifying misuse of  a child' scene.  The 'bobbing fluffy bottom of the male top' scene.  The 'random reversal of loyalties' theme.  The 'hysterically and dementedly rapid fucking' scene.  And the 'spiritus ex machina' shit is just rampant.  I mean, nobody's ass can stay dead in 'Coven'. Man, watch the hell out of 'Freak Show'.  It's brilliant.  You do not know what's going to happen next and the characters and script are astounding.Skip the rest.______________________________Muk at the Movies II:  A surprise winner, a little hidden gem, simply entitled 'Monster'.  It takes place mainly in Mexico, and concerns aliens, Trumps' Wall, and aliens.  An excellent and scary little film.Hidden gem 2:  'Dolly Parton:  Here I Am.'  I am not a country/western fan, and I am not a big fan of the female singing voice.  It's Dolly herself that shines here, and I was absolutely captivated.  The woman is an undeniable talent, but it's her titanium professionalism that comes through.  This woman is in complete charge of  her image, and plays to the cheap seats, unapologetically - and boy, did she know what she was doing.  Thinking about starting a company?  Take Dolly's attitude as your North Star. Give absolutely nothing of yourself away. Utterly divorce your private self from your public self.  Get multiple boob jobs.Hidden gem and guilty pleasure 3:  'Cat People', a limited documentary series.  The first episode is about batshit weirdo nutty people from Portland Oregon, which I am all about.  The rest of the episodes are entertaining as well.  Interestingly, in 'Cat People' the stories are all about the cats.  In the limited series 'Dog People' the story always revolves around the owners."},
{"title": "CAUTION:  Another Garden Post ABOUT ROSES", "date": "Wednesday, July 21, 2021", "text": "This is going to take longer to read than will be to absorb and use, so get the fuck over it and read it.  I'm doing you a favor. ROSES MAKE EVERYTHING PERFECT________________________________________________________________________________Everyone thinks 'Roses are so DE MAN DINGGG!\" and I am here to give you realness:  They are no more demanding than any other garden plant.  Here's the thing - roses are so popular and have been so loved by so many people over the centuries that there is a metric buttload times ten butts worth of information out there about roses - and it's been accumulating since the Dark Ages, kats and kittens.  They aren't difficult - they just have a lot of press.A rose, just like any other plant, is a monster in the right place.  Here's how simple it is.  In fact you can take these rules and apply them to all garden plants, perennial or annual.To Do In The Dead Of Winter, Before You Plant - You PLAN.    There are five things to know about roses, or any plant you plan to purchase before you purchase:  Culture, PH, water and light requirements, and USDA zone.    1. Determine your soil type. Is it a high PH or a low PH?  Is it sandy loam or heavy clay? Go to Daves Garden.com and read up on what I mean by that shit, I'm not your mother.  Soil is not just stuff smeared all over the planet like peanut butter.  Different locations have different - let's call it  \"Ingredients\".   Before you plant ANY PLANT you must learn about your local soil type. You see, the plant that you buy growing in high-nutrient growth medium (what you look at and think of as dirt there in the pot) is sitting in very different stuff than what you have surrounding your house. 'Growth medium' is a highly processed material filled with things that you do NOT want to know about, like 'growth limiter' and 'pest drenches' and - but you don't want to know about it.  Take my word for it - the stuff is a combination of disparate natural and un-natural ingredients mixed to support the root system of a plant and enable it to survive shipping and mistreatment on the store shelves.  It's nothing whatsoever to do with soil.Now.  Go to the nursery and browse. Take time to fall in love.  Experience the ravishment of the senses that only a rose can provide and open your soul to beguilement.   Now.  DO NOT BUY ANYTHING.  Just take the name of the rose you love down, and better yet; steal the tag (I do this all the time. Catch me if you can.) and then look up all that information online.  Can't steal the tag?  Copy down the name and the brand, then look it up.  Here's why:   They used to put all that info on plant tags.  Not so much these days.  Similarly the USDA zone info is also now missing from plant tags so do what auntie FN tells you - take down the name and brand of the plant, and then look it up online and you will eventually find this absolutely, all-important information.  It's the difference between a living and a dead plant, kids.-Bravo!  You did it! You have a zone 6-8 rose that can grow in full sun/light shade in acid to neutral soil!  Look at you and your research skills!  Of course you don't know what the fuck soil PH or soil type are.  Well then.You can find out what your Soil PH and Soil Type are by calling  the Agricultural Extension Office, which is FREE, and either telling them where you live, or telling them where you live AND bringing along a sample of your soil to their office.  There are actually things called 'soil maps' of where you live that you can access online after a lot of fucking around, but they're pretty technical.  It's just easier as a beginner to call up your local Agricultural Extension office and ask for a soil expert, and explain your issue and get an answer.  \\Or here's the fast and dirty route:   Roses want acid soil, and they like a little clay in the mix.  You have no idea what I mean by that.  Look it up online.2. Determine your USDA zone.  Hella simple.  Chuck 'USDA zone' and your town name into Mr. Google and you will get an answer to that question jiffy quick.  Why do this? Because big box store and hardware stores and general retail PLANTS ARE SOLD BY USDA ZONE.  And you cannot always trust their information.  What is a USDA zone?  LOOK IT UP ONLINE.  (Note:  Home Depot  doesn't give a flying fuck about you or your garden.  They'll carry things like Confederate Jasmine, Flame Lilly and Bougainvillia here in zone 7 and figure you'll blame yourself when those zone 9 - 10 plants die, and then buy more to replace them. Fuck you, Home Depot. And their roses are garbage.)Instant replay of information already given follows:So go to the nursery or big box store, or just look at pretty pictures online, and FFS take a notebook and write down the name of the rose you just fell in love with, and then look that bastard up online BEFORE YOU BUY.  That's where you'll find the information you need on culture, ph, water, light requirements, and USDA zone. Enter the name of your darlings into Google Images, find your beauties, click through and read the USDA and soil PH requirements on MULTIPLE SITES because it's easier to find retail sites and culture info this way.  If you don't find them on one site, you will on another, or on Daves Garden.com.  Make a note of these favorites in your bookmarks or by copy/pasting the links to a document so that you can go over them in the long cold months of winter.  Go to every site that has a reference to your dream rose and read every single thing you can about it.  It won't take long, and it will save you time, money and heartache come spring.3. Starting out, buy in person from a REPUTABLE nursery.  This is the hard part.  Go online, hit Yelp, get those recommendations.  Hit up your local Garden Club online and ask them. Connect with people who live in your USDA Zone  - within a 25 mile distance of your ass - on Daves' Garden.com and ask those people.  Or just, like, if you know your neighbors, ask them. 4. Do not buy the roses that you love and want. Exercise some self-restraint. SELECT ROSES THAT WILL GROWN ON YOUR SOIL AND IN YOUR USDA ZONE.  Now, if all three elements happen to coincide, well that's good karma!  And lacking good karma, you can still get really, really close to what you want in the rose world these days.  There are roses bred to grow in Canada and Alaska!  There are roses bred to grow by the seaside in high winds and shitty, sandy soil!  There are roses that will grow in swamps, and roses that will grow in deserts.  There is even a climbing rose!  There are roses that never get any bigger than a guinea pig, and roses that will grow to the size of small houses over time.  And all the blossom forms and colors!  Wahoo!  It's a smorglasferd!5. THINK ABOUT THE COLOR OF YOUR HOUSE.  If your house is duckie yellow or peachy peach, there are colors you should avoid.  Green, of course, will be the bass note in your symphony.  Green is a mix of yellow and blue.  Add the color of your house.  That's three colors you now have to work around.  Go online and check out the Pantone Color Wheel, which will tell you what colors will go with your house paint and what colors will blow.  (My personal bitch to pick is  the combination of a hard, hard red rose out in front of a white house.  No matter what color of red it is, the white will suck all the life out of it and it will look black to the passing glance.  GAAH)OK.  You've spent maybe an hour all told on this shit out of the whole winter, period. You have dreamed, fallen in and out of love, and learned amazing things.  Now, armed with this information, go forth and SPEND come the first hint of Spring, and get there early.  Us plant nerds are dangerous animals come early spring when the first shipments of David Austin and Jackson and Perkins roses are put on the ground, just waiting for our lust to engulf and devour them.Digression follows.     This is a tale of living and learning.Rosa 'Intrigue' will grow like gangbusters in a solid zone 7 location with a regular application of well-rotted horse manure, because rosa 'Intrigue' is what's called a heavy feeder. It wants rich, rich soil.  It will beguile you with it's perfect, imperial murex purple color and continuous blooms. It has a 'true rose' fragrance. The blossom form is classic, a whirl of petals, high-centered, just gorgeous.Go on Google Maps and look up Deming, WA.  Rosa 'Intrigue' will grow into a generous, beautiful igloo of fragrant purple blossoms in Deming.  22 miles away here in Sumas? Fuck off and die, bitch. I am talking about a distance of 22 miles, people.  22 miles between the Sumas USDA zone 7 and the geothermally warmed soil of  USDA Zone 7 in Deming.  Locally Deming is referred to as 'The Banana Belt' by old fuckers for this very reason.  Just a small area in the foothills, but only 22 miles makes the difference between a live, sexy 'Intrigue' rose and a languishing clump of thorns that hates you here in Sumas, where I live.  So, half the reason that this rose died was out of my control.The other half of the reason it died was because I was ignorant of it's specific needs.  It wanted full sun, horse manure and lots of elbow room in a solid USDA Zone 7 garden.  I gave it half a day's shade, compost tea and crowded it with bluebells and calendula in a Zone 6 microclimate garden because I fell in love at first sight and whipped out my debit card.  And I learned my $35.00 mistake the hard way because I didn't do my reading.You will make mistakes.  Digression Ends.A note on traditional rose tips and tricks:  Some people give the soil around their roses a little Epsom Salts (for magnesium) and a little sulphur (to acidify the soil and kill fungi.)  Some folks will put used coffee grounds around the base of their roses (to acidify the soil) and mix in banana peels (for potassium.)Some folks will put a banana and a an old rusty piece of iron in the planting hole to add, well, iron, and potassium.Some folks will put three smelt in the planting hole of a new rose (to enrich the soil just generally, because there really isn't any other use for smelt.)All of these things Do Work Absolutely.  Now they don't work miracles, but they provide a boost, and they are safe, and a strong plant resists disease.  I would not do all of them at the same time, and I would err on the side of too little.  I swear by epsom salts and sulphur.  It works, and you can't tell me any different. Experience and my 23 years of records stand to prove the fact.  My father swore by the 'smelt' method and we had a fantastic landscape.  My grandmother used the 'handful of rusty nails and a banana' for her roses and they were man-eaters!  Now go online and see every single one of those methods debunked by some mook.  And you may wonder to yourself 'I wonder if some Big Chemical Company might be paying that alleged garden blogger to say those things?'  And you may ask yourself ' What is that beautiful house?  And you may ask yourself 'Where does that highway go to?' And you may ask yourself 'Am I right?  Am I wrong?\" And you may say to yourself 'My God! Enough with the Talking Heads references!'  But pay attention to what I've written here.  Roses are not difficult!  My roses are fuck off and die sluggers.  They'll steal your car and make you write bad checks.  And it's because I chose the right rose for the right location.  When people bitch about roses being difficult, it's because they fell in love at first sight with something not suited to their location and are now a slave to the chemical corporations and the shovel and the watering can, trying to keep their high-maintenance bitch happy.And that's all you really need to know about roses.Except for pruning..."},

I am wearing it now.  It smells.  I should wash it. I should change shirts. I won't, though.I've had this crush going since 1973, when PBS began broadcasting 'Monty Pythons' Flying Circus.'  At first, I was all about Eric Idle, but Johnny...was it the tar-black vitriol, the mania, or the genius?  I submit that it was all three, plus I am a sucker for a cute, balding, long, tall drink of water with a British accent.  The fact that he'll get naked without a second thought is just...well, nowadays it'd be icky, but back then, I was  just all like daaaaaaaaaamn, six foot four and a half, and worth the climb! Yeah baby, yeah!It hasn't been a smooth ride.  I've been mad as hell at him on and off for years.  He'll say something or do something so shitty that I'll just go on a Cleese strike.  Fuck'im.  But I always come crawling back.  I even watched a children's animated movie recently because he did the voice of an evil walrus in it.The thing I like about the Black Knight is the fucker has no quit in him.  Not an ounce.  Cut off all his limbs, he'll gnaw on your ankles.  And that's a lot like me.  I'm absolutely indifferent to the futility of my situation, but I have no quit in me, and I will gnaw on your ankles.  So I will wear this shirt until it rots off me, just like I wore my John Cleese concert t-shirt until it rotted off me.  That's not an overstatement. I was forbidden to wear that shirt off the property.  I did anyway.  My psychiatrist remembers watching it age over the years.  I finally had to consign it to the flames, because there was more hole than shirt.  I could not just throw it away, no. NO no no.  I gave it a Viking funeral. (Well, a Sumas funeral, burned in a tractor wheel covered in waste paper with some gasoline to get things whuppin'.)I don't know how he's thought about in in the UK, particularly since he defected to our side of the pond.  What I know is that in 1973, all we here in America had to hang onto in the way of smart, funny comedy was the Flip Wilson Show.  One show.  One.  ONE.  ...until the public access station started playing Doctor in the House and Monty Python's Flying Circus.  And you had to stay up until 10:00 on a Thursday, I think it was, to catch them.  My mother adored Doctor in the House.  I have her to thank for turning me on to British Comedy, in fact!  She had a crush on the character Michael Upton.  I liked the Eric Idle character, the ridiculously wealthy 'who gives a fuck' professional student.  And the Monty Python show came on right after Doctor In The House.  That came right at moms' bedtime.  It was a long while before she ever saw 'The Queen Victoria Races' or  The Battle of Pearl Harbor by the Batley Townswomen's Guild.'  I owe a good part of my sanity to John Cleese.  Remember that 'funny' and 'smart' were for the most part mutually exclusive terms on this side of the Atlantic back in 1973.  We had shit like 'Green Acres' and 'My Mother The Car' and 'Gilligans Island' over here.  Y'all had The Goon Show, The Two Ronnies and Marty Feldman.  And Python.  Let's all sing:Immanuel Kant was a real pissantWho was very rarely stableHeidegger, Heidegger was a boozy beggarWho could think you under the tableDavid Hume could out-consumeWilhelm Friedrich HegelAnd Wittgenstein was a beery swineWho was just as sloshed as SchlegelThere's nothing Nietzche couldn't teach ya'Bout the raising of the wristSocrates, himself, was permanently pissedJohn Stuart Mill, of his own free willOn half a pint of shandy was particularly illPlato, they say, could stick it awayHalf a crate of whiskey every dayAristotle, Aristotle was a bugger for the bottleHobbes was fond of his dramAnd René Descartes was a drunken fart\"I drink, therefore I am\"Yes, Socrates, himself, is particularly missedA lovely little thinkerBut a bugger when he's pissed!Never in a million years would something like that have made it on to television in the U.S.  Oh, maybe Steve Allen might make a quick reference to Paracelsus or something, and Dick Cavett might host a wry, witty soul and banter a bit, but it was for the main part all pratfalls and pies in the face here, Hee Haw and Dukes of Hazard, without relief.  Now perhaps if you lived in New York you might have gotten some broadcast that appealed to the intellect, but I did not live in New York, and neither did most people, as I dimly recall.  To this day, New York can only hold so many people.In a way, MPFC saved the sanity of a whole generation over here.  It was and still is to a large extent a very 'Gentleman C' culture, where being smart and showing your intelligence is considered rude, and making a joke that requires advance book larnin' to get is just rude.  Now right here my impulse to assure everyone out there that I am by no means a genius is - see?  I just slipped it in under cover.  I'm not even talking about college level stuff here - just anything a high school senior might get.  Our popular culture was under the pall of the advertisers creed for so long (all viewers, generally taken, average out as about eight years old in terms of sophistication and learning, so aim that high and no higher) that it poisoned our outlook and, I'll argue, our culture at large as well. When it came to television, nobody had to be educated. Nobody had to try.  Nobody was in danger of feeling stupid.  All in the name of selling Rice a Roni, the San Francisco Treat, or what have you.  My parents were fed that shit, and I grew up on it.  And then, suddenly, miraculously, in the middle of all that horror there was a funny, quirky show that only the Public Access Station would dare show, late at night, and every single kid and adult that could keep their eyes open (in Oregon) would stay up just so they could watch this amazing, miraculous, insane prodigy of wtf humor, nailing the 1970's zeitgeist, and satisfying our hunger for something that wasn't approved by a fucking committee.  I saw my first televised full frontal nudity on MPFC.  God Bless Them.So anyway I love John Cleese.  Would I have him as a neighbor?  Oh fuck no.  Imagine the complaints. (\"This woman threw a deceased snail over my fence.  Am I allowed to hire someone to beat her or shall I simply set her garage on fire?\") I imagine him lighting firecrackers and throwing them on my roof.  Or buying a sack of ammonium nitrate and sprinking the word 'bitch' in large letters on my lawn (do this at night, and come the morning sure, try and wash it off.  It will come up in block letters greener and taller than the rest of your lawn for about three years.  If you have a neighbor you hate, take note.)  I know he is that petty and devious.But oh Lordy the crush I still have on him!  Even as the godhorrid bastard Basil Fawlty.  I LOVE THIS MAN GOD HELP ME.  His mind!  His humor!  His ability to throw his entire self into getting a laugh!  And that he did a good part of it in that cultured, educated accent just melts my shorts, y'all.Here is how much I love John Cleese:Back in the 1980's I printed out a picture of 'The Announcer Wearing A Bikini' , folded it into four and put it into my wallet.  It's gone with me on ever job interview and into every difficult situation for years now, because when you have a picture of John Cleese in a bikini in your wallet, nothing more insane can happen to you, in America.  I'd think of that picture, sitting waiting for a job interview or a doctors appointment or what have you, and it would smooth me right out.  I still have it, in fact.  And it still helps."},

Also to the upper right are a small drift of red mop-heads; that's bee balm, and some yellow hangy-downy podlike things - those are tiger lilies that have not opened yet.Focus on the rose.  The spent blossoms, the leaves, the canes, and all.  Most of all, focus not on the glorious cloud of multicolored blossoms, but on the sheer perfection of the leaves and canes.Regular, bog standard 'Josephs' Coat' is a notorious bastard of a rose.  It has all the glam of a floribunda and the drama of 'Tropicana' and all the disease resistance of a malnourished Victorian infant.  The plants are usually nude of all leaves by this time of year, and those that remain are horrible objects covered in leprosy and black spot and what have you. Similarly the ultra-thorny canes.  Just awful, and not worth the few colorful blossoms you might get. I found this rose, as I've said probably four times by now, in a little privately run 'curated' specialty nursery in Sequim, Washington.  It was a hot, dry day, the wind was terrible, and there was one tall cane jutting up out of the container with a truss of blossoms, and that was it.But it was PERFECT.And so it has continued to be.  I have been graced by the Universe with this flawless wonder of a plant.  If you can find this rose anywhere, I cannot urge you strongly enough to purchase it at any cost.  I paid ten dollars for this one.  It laughs at dry weather, strong wind, sudden rain, and hellish temperatures.  And it's just glorious.  The leaves are a matte apple green, the blossoms are doubled, and have a wonderful, hoydenish form.  The petals change color by the hour - literally.  You can almost set your watch by when each blossom opens, then goes from bright scarlet through the apricots to clear yellow, pale yellow and finally pink- and every possible tint on that spectrum.  One hour! I have literally timed it! Yes! makes the difference between a scarlet rose and an apricot orange one on the same truss!  It holds it's petals well, and after three days any given blossom is done.  Keep the hips popped off for the next month, and then let the last ones stay on the plant.  That is an old-time trick that actually seems to work - the plant 'senses' the presence of seed-bearing bodies lingering on it's life support system and 'remembers' to make more of them next season.  They're called flowers, kids.  If you have a very old variety of rose, like Zephyrine Drouhin, Crested Moss, The Fairy or Celine Brunner, treat it the same way.  Cull the spent petals and clip the first hips away once the first flush of flowers has gone by to get a blossom here and there for the rest of the summer on these 'one time' bloomers.  And leave that last crop of hips alone!  Cut them away, and you'll get bupkis for flowers the next year - Zephyrine will go into a two-year sulk.  Those old, old varieties are so close to wild that they really depend on the action of the natural world to regulate their systems.  You are just there to keep them from eating small children and dogs, and to clear away the deadwood.______________________________________"},
{"title": "Failed To Solve The UK, Was Promoted To Pet Status", "date": "Monday, July 12, 2021", "text": "Yesterday afternoon I was chilling on the couch, reading some H.P. Lovecraft, when the Biker called to me \"There's some people here who want to see their gardener!\"And so it was that I was summoned forth by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.\"We're here because we haven't come over for awhile,\" announced one.  The other two nodded.  \"We didn't come over because-\" and things devolved into the usual mix of chaos and fantasy.  There was something about a crazy cat lady and a travel trailer and needing to sleep in a tent and I don't know what all, and meanwhile they're roaming around inspecting the place.  I'd just pulled up a lot of things that had gone by, and I was informed that I'd made quite a mess.  \"But you'll clean it up,\" said the oldest.OK.They discovered my bicycle in the shed, and were absolutely amazed by it.  \"It's SO OLD', they marveled.  \"Why's it got a basket on it?  Can you do a wheelie?\"And somehow I ended up riding out with Death, Famine, War and Pestilence.  Since there are only three consistent Horsemen and the fourth position is usually taken by a random kid or kids, I got to be...I dunno, Pestilence, I guess.I really needed to ride my bike slooowlyyy up and down the sidewalk in the middle of the hottest part of the day with three little boys, lemme tell you.  The littlest doesn't know how to use the brakes on his bike so he crashed into me to stop, and I was told to expect this because \"That's the only way he wants to stop, you know.\"  Back and forth we wobbled, mostly in a tangle.Somehow in the middle of all this, I went from being Mrs. FirstNations to Firsty.  This is when it suddenly occurred to me:  They are not my pet Horsemen.  I am their pet old lady.____________________________We are being given a break from the second heatwave, thank God.  But I look at Oregon on the weather maps and you can see where I grew up, the Willamette Valley, show as one long and very distinct streak of red - and that's how I remember it during this time of the year. So hot that everyone stayed up until midnight or later and all the little kids ran around the neighborhood with flashlights, or slept on towels at their parents feet; and people wandered from house to house in the dark visiting.  It's one of my favorite childhood memories.But the days were hell.  The Willamette Valley gets heat inversions (I may  have that name wrong.)  What it means is that one layer of air covers over the valley from side to side along it's entire geological length, and the air beneath just sits there and gets hotter and dirtier and more humid and the wind doesn't blow - not even the hint of a breeze.  The days were horrible.  The air over Portland turned a lurid sienna color, and it smelled like smoke.  Of course there was always a burn ban on, but everyone would have a bonfire at night, and of course folks were barbecuing and grilling outdoors; and there was usually a wildfire going on up in the Cascades - and that smoke just laid there.  The moon would come up magnified to insane proportions by all the crud in the air, like the initial dome of fire in an atomic blast, and everyone would gather outside to watch it rise, blazing orange or bright scarlet, over the side of Mt. Hood.There was a benefit, although it was kind of eerie - that kind of weather made all the plants just continue to grow and get bigger and fatter and  more full of juice, because the wind didn't take the humidity out of the air, and the humidity was seldom below 90%.  It would get positively Amazonian toward the end of August, the wild grasses growing six and seven feet tall, trees with their limbs hanging from the weight of the leaves, the fruit, and new, water-fat growth.  To stand under an apple tree was like standing inside a terrarium that smelled of apple leaves and fallen, oversweet apples going by, and you could feel it on your skin, the damp.  It was shade, but it was weird, freaky shade.The wild things and the perennial things grew like crazy, but everyones' lawn was dead white in August.  Even the people with in-ground watering systems ended up with perfect round spots of green around each sprinkler head, surrounded by dead grass.There's a nice breeze blowing here, and I've had to learn to compensate for it by watering in the evening to avoid windburn during the day.  That took me by absolute surprise.  I had this body memory of the Willamette Valley and it just seemed so weird and wrong to be watering in August.  In Oregon, your vegetable garden would be going nuts; the tomatoes would go rogue, everything got huge and Frankensteinian, and if you watered, those garden plants would rot.  Different story here entirely.  Everything waits until August to jump, and then you better be ready with the hose every evening or the next afternoon it will have fainted, coughing it's last, like a Victorian lady with a tight corset.I hope that wherever you are, the weather isn't sucking.  If it is, take care."},
{"title": "I Solve The UK", "date": "Saturday, July 10, 2021", "text": "The thing I get from watching  UK television programs is, all you have to do is stick a shovel in the ground and boom, you've got an archeological dig you never wanted.   How do you get anything new built, UK persons?  Under cover of darkness?  Take out a building permit for location A and then sneak off and build something in location B?  Because holy crap, between Time Team and every other historical documentary out there, that's got to be the case.  And the documentary I'm watching now, there's six different unexpected layers of archeological interest in the location of an existing Tudor-era castle, because apparently that castle isn't historical enough.  Just quit showing off.  Stop it.  Now.  I mean it.The earliest thing I've found on my property is a hide scraper, specifically one used on fish skin (really) and small animal skins, nicely chipped and shaped by the original Native inhabitants.  Then the next thing you find here is scads of garbage - literal garbage - from the 1870s on until the 1930's.  Since this used to be marshland, one of the ways they used to raise the building level was to heap up the trash and then smash it all out in big swathes and pile dirt on top.  I have an old patent medicine bottle, a china dolly arm (a little creepy) and a metric shit-ton of hand-hammered nails and spikes.And that's really it for this area.  Before that, oh, you might dig down a good twenty feet and find some poor drowned early Mammoth Hunters and a Thule Person or two who overshot the mark by a few miles.  This was a bog for millennia,  so who knows?  I am content to let them lie.  I double dug and built up every single bed on this property to the depth of four feet and it was dogs work.  I have a good foot of black, beautiful, ionic silt and then anaerobic blue clay, and getting air into that mixture and breaking it all up and making it productive took one determined little Muk, a sharp shovel, and access to the city compost heap, out of which I took truckload after truckload of plant material to layer in.There is such an amount of good quality clay in the area that there were at least three different kilns in the area, and I have stamped bricks from all three, which is kind of cool.  I could, given an interest in pottery, which I lack entirely, buy a kiln, condition what I dig up in my garden (which contains the occasional bit of bog iron and coal) and make myself some lovely pottery.  I know lots of atavistic, useless skills like that.  I could, say, make yarn out of dog hair combings and weave it into a shawl.  I promise I won't.Another thing I take away from these documentaries is that the UK is tit-deep in pottery sherds.  Finding earthenware here is pretty rare, and is usually a broken pickling crock. Or, come to think of it, probably a fermentation crock, because Sumas was known to have more taverns than churches, and it has that reputation to this day, even though the situation has reversed.  I rather like that I live in \"Ooo, Sumas, wild and wooly, huh?\" instead of \"Ugh, Lynden, roll up the sidewalks at 6:00.\" The wildest and wooliest thing that's happened here recently is that sometime last week someone took a giant dump right outside the foundation blocks of the apartment complex they built up against my garage.  Now these foundation blocks, used to raise the land the buildings stand on, extend out into the alley allowance, and that's where the dirty deed took place; so it's not like someone crapped right outside my fence or anything - but that anyone grunted one out there at all (at least they wiped; they left the napkin they used) is icky.  I have my suspicions, and they center on one particular little ruffian.I still worry about getting a building permit in the UK though.  Is there a cut-off date?  If you dig down and find something from WWII, like Hitler waving up at you, can you still build your garage?  What if you want a basement?  Can you have a basement?  If you go down far enough you're going to find a mass plague burial or King Richard or some shit like that.  Do you just quietly slip your find into the neighbors trash bin and keep on digging?  Because if you don't quit it, eventually the whole island is going to be run by the National Trust.  You know that, right?  Anyplace where you can make a living as a specialist in 13th century papermaking is headed in that direction.If I had it to do over again now, I'd head straight for the UK and become either an archivist, a librarian, or an archeological forensics scientist, because I can stay in America and dig holes -  I want a desk job if I'm going to start over in the UK.  I could be in charge of Bog Bodies!  I would be a fantastic Bog Body archeo-science-person!  I could put them in the refrigerator, I could take then out of the refrigerator, I would give them names, like Chuck, and I would keep them dusted off.  Or I could work at the Bodeleian.  I could work like a motherfucker at the Bodeleian.  I would live under my desk and eat cheese with the mice to work at the Bodeleian.  ALL THOSE OLD BOOKS!!!!You know the first thing I'd do?  Pass out those white cotton archivists' gloves.  Y'all people are so used to having written material from back when there wasn't even more than one number in the year that you wave it about like playing cards.  I see original ancient manuscripts being passed around from bare hand to bare hand and I just cringe.  They used to make us wear cotton gloves to use the huge old dictionary at the library!  And you're over there just 'Oh look, a royal land grant that mentions the Loch Ness Monster and UFO's from the year 3 AD' and make a paper airplane out of it and fly it back and forth across the room.My solution is for y'all make less of a big old thing about neolithic ditches and pay attention to taking proper care of the books and manuscripts.  You are only allowed to stop a building project if there's actual human remains or a buttload of treasure. And everyone has to do two compulsory years LARP'ing in a 'Living History' settlement to develop a sense of perspective.  Nice people get to work in the Edwardian places.  If you're a dick you have to work at the 9th century monastery in the Orkneys manufacturing parchment. Yeah, let's see you flap around the ancient manuscripts bare-handed after two years of that shit."},

In fact it's even better than when I was a kid, because I'm well used to the big old ass and the mondo titties I suddenly sprouted when I was in fourth grade (making me about ten at the time.)  I know how to shift all that  meat around, and I am shifting my meat around all over this town._________________________________These days, people don't have garage sales. It's a covid thing. They place whatever they want to get rid of by the road with a 'Free' sign on it.  And this includes impromptu canned food caches too.  The people of Sumas have really come through for their neighbors in this respect and it makes me proud of my little town.The Biker put a basket on the front of my bike.  \"It's exactly the size of a six-pack,\" he beamed, and I had to laugh, because it is, really, actually, precisely the size of a six pack of beer.  It's like he knows me or something. And off I go around the neighborhood, saying 'Hi!' to people out barbecuing, or smoking a bole in the evening, and it's all right.  I'll need a bike lock before I go to the corner store to actually load up on premium craft beer, though, and I don't have one of those yet, so for now I just glide around saying 'hello' to people and having nice conversations.I found a 'Free' pile next to the road a block down from where I live, and I stopped and went through the books.  I found a lot of Louis L'Amour, which the Biker likes, and loaded up the basket. He's reading one of them right now, and I feel really proud of myself for being able to show how much I appreciate the bike and all the work he's done by giving the gift of Pulp Cowboy Fiction.________________________________I am a rabid H. P. Lovecraft fan.   The first horror story that I ever read, or saw, that scared me HARD (and I don't mean the jump-cut screams of the old horror movies or novels like 'The Turn of the Screw' 'The Other' or 'Dracula', I mean scared so badly that I had tears running down my face and I wasn't crying, it just happened because I was so freaked out)  was 'The Dunwich Horror'.  It was included in a collection called \"Eleven Great Horror Stories\" and I was able to get it through the Scholastic Book Program (this was an organization that sold books to grade school kids at a reduced rate.  I always had one of the biggest orders, and bless my parents, they were more than happy to pay.)  I got ahold of this book in 1971, when I was just turning 11.  I had a whole big old order of books on my desk, and you couldn't open the package until you got home.I sat up that night and read the first story, \"The Judge's House' and it was by Bram Stoker, and it was readable, and OK, that was nice.  Rats. Spectral judges. Fine.Then I turned to the next story.  It was \"The Dunwich Horror.\"Until that very moment I had been immune to all horror movies and stories.  I'd read Dracula, I'd seen every monster movie and splatter flick they'd play on television, it was during the Vietnam War and the Burning of Portland and I was one jaded little sixth grader.\"The Dunwich Horror\" literally held me transfixed and unable to stop reading.  I was so scared by that thing I had to accept a whole new level of horror into my life, it was so fucked up.I sat on my bed and read it by the light of a candle (that I was not supposed to have.)  My parents were snoring like bulldogs one wall away.  It was the dead of the night, and I was feeling the claws of this wholly unknown, new level of fear sink into the meat of my heart.  My. Heart.The tears ran down my face as I read, and like I said, it wasn't because I was sad; it was because I was so scared that the only thing my body could do, I guess, was to shed tears, because the rest of me was frozen in place.  Once I had finished the story, I swiftly shook  off it's grip on my imagination.  That's the funny thing - it didn't maintain a hold on me afterwards, but while I was reading, I would have fought off anyone who tried to stop me from turning the pages, as horror-stricken as each page made me, as that horror grew with each page.  I had to read it to it's end.I remember sitting there afterward.  I looked around my room, and it was a typical kids room, Import One posters of Bosche,  Buddha, the fangirl poster of Elton John,  Frazetta's ' Ice Rider' and other crap like that all over the walls, and my bookcase full of volumes that I have until this day, and the terror just lifted away.It's as close to magic, real magic, the compulsion of one overmastering will upon a lesser will, that I would ever experience.When you need horror, you need the catharsis that you experience.. It's why I was drawn to the work of H. R. Giger, Metal Hurlant magazine, Diane Arbus,  Heironymous Bosch, Jan Van Eyck and Andres Serrano. I embraced the Decadents,  the hardcore psychedelic artists, and adopted the towering, cryptic genius of DaVinci as my patron saint and North Star.In 1985 I took DaVinci as the heart and center of my self-instruction and set out to learn everything that he might have known, or heard of, or been part of; 1415 to 1519, as my educational guide.  Years before I'd read in one of the Whole Earth publications the sentence 'Take what you are interested in and follow it wherever it leads you' as my intellectual guide.  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mjl63e0ms).  If I don't  have something to be curious about, I die a little inside.  Do I have a macabre turn of mind? After what I went through as a kid and a young adult, you better fucking believe I have more than a stripe of the black. I am who I am, and I love who I am, the proof of who I am written in the scars, man and woman in one body.  This journey has lead me to the Bible, the  Torah, the Koran, the Septuagint, the Book of Mormon and more; I've got a copy of the Malleus Malificarum, the Three Books of Occult Philosophy, and a copy of \"The Confessions of Aleister Crowley\". I have the spurious copy of the Necronomicon.  I have the Zondervan Parallel Bible, tabulated, filled with holy cards, and containing a segment ogf blessed ribbon worn by a flagellant nun of the Sacred Blood of Christ.Yeah, no shit.I am not fucking around with life.Tell me I can't read something. That's the first thing I'll read.  Tell me I can't do something.  It's the first thing I'll do.It's all about history, kats and kittens.  Either you maintain such an open mind that your brain falls out, or you pause and reflect, compare and examine, and let those ruminations work in the deep places in your head until you find the key that opens the door between one philosophy and the next.Now I'm not out here in Sumas holding Black Masses or conducting Grand Workings out in my garden, because ew. Even though I was born on Beltane. Even though I might or might not have a bit of a pagan altar in my garden shed.  I just get down to it and assist the vegetation, the pure forms of life on this word, to flourish and become.I was raised in the Catholic religion, which is particularly fortunate if you have any Pagan leanings, because the Catholicism of the common parishioner is the Paganism of their ancestors.  There's been a lot of co-opting and special dispensations over time, a few apostate popes, one who was possibly female, and a grand schism or three that fucked everything up.  What's left after all that is the way the living thing that animates your body is impelled to represent itself and give honor to its continuation in symbolic form, and don't thank me for that explanation, thank Jung. That's what Catholicism is today.There are times out in the garden, out in the woods, on the beach or in the cyclopean old growth forests that surround me that I am reduced to wonder and gratitude.  There is someone that I thank.  God?  I don't know.  It's an ecstatic thing. I am filled with gratitude and humility (I know, me, right?) and I confess that to what, I don't know.Satanic worship has never attracted me. You worship Satan, you live for sixty years, and then spend eternity up to your tits in fire and shit, getting poked by demons. Nope.  Not my idea of a good eternity. I've done my reading.  Satanism always ends up the same as the splinter groups that follow a Godly 'prophet' and obey his mandates. (The inevitable 'him' in these scenarios always causes me to stop and think 'What the fuck.')  Without exception, these settlements end up being a nice little isolated  cult wherein the main man gets to fuck anyone he wants to. Time and again.  Here in what was known as Oregon Territory - before they decided that Oregon was kind of a weird name for a huge plot of land - there were tens of utopian, religious, prophet-lead communities that settled land claims and all ended up the same way - running around naked, screwing whoever came into view, and the leader selecting his 'special and  most holy wives' from the hottest of the women in the neighborhood.  I always wondered why their husbands never seemed to kick up a fuss about that. It was always some local branch of law enforcement, aided by a Methodist minister, that busted this shit and told everyone to quit acting weird and put on some damn clothes. I don't think of myself as a Pagan.  I'm an agnostic with what might be nothing more that dippy impulses.  Because I was raised Catholic, I am able to support diametrically opposed realities without any mental issues about that shit whatsoever.  God in three persons, blessed trinity?  It's like Superman! Clark Kent is Clark Kent, but he's also Superman.  His identity never changes.  And there you go, kats and kittens:  my explanation of the Trinitarian God. Clark Kent, Superman, and the reality of his extraterrestrial beingness and abilities.I have no idea what lead me onto this fuckin' tangent about God and bicycles.  But there ya go."},

Now, is my ancient ass actually going to get up early and do that shit in the cool of the morning? Fuck no.  So SUFFER.  Suffice it to say that once these bullshit high temps have passed I'll be taking new pictures.  So imagine:  rosa 'Sunsplash' in exuberant blossom, like a Mardi Gras float, all ruffles and hip-shaking!  Imagine rosa 'The Fairy' as an igloo of the purest driven snow, big enough for a family of three!  Imagine my 'toped and formed Camperdown Elm as a study in geometric framework overgrown by careless green leaves!  The calendula in all its yellow and orange brashness filling in all the places where the early bulbs have quietly lain down to sleep over until the spring of next year!  The sheer rampaging, skyward climb of my clematis 'Jackmanii' with three perfect, late, daring blossoms of clematis 'Nelly Moser' peeking through  here and there to upset it's purple dominance!All my daylilies have come up pale, save for the few I have in the shade and damp.  They're healthy, and I've pushed the evening watering, but perhaps it's a response to the grand scheme of things - they don't want to tempt their frail pollinators out of mid-day rest.  In the evening their blue and white tones shine all the brighter, and the insects teem around them, sometimes dripping in living rivulets of buzzing wings and eagerness from the centers of the blossoms, the bumblebees robbing each other of their pollen gather.My *ahem* Shasta Daisies are having a banner year.  This is particularly poignant given the fact that I have been forbidden by the Biker from *ahem* utilizing the crop for it's intended purpose. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laudanum  )Everything has blossomed a month early.  I've been spot watering the plants that have shown stress, and this has paid off, although it meant me staying up until midnight and later so I could water deeply.  I imagine the late night partiers driving past, seeing me squatting next to the beds, aiming a stream of water through the root level of the plantings, and thinking \"I really need to quit smoking crack.  Did I just see a fat old hobbit lady pissing straight out like a goddamn racehorse back there?  Do I have a brain tumor?  What the actual fuck?  Did you see that?  Maybe we should just never speak of this again.\"The struggle, as they say, is real, though.  I've had damage to two valuable evergreens because of wind burn, and saving those plants means you have to hammer the water into the drip line all around the margin of that plant in order for its roots to access enough moisture to transfer to the parts most distant from the trunk and combat the effect of the hot, dry wind.  So I'm out there with the hose going at 'firefighter' velocity ramming the water into my clay soil - Digression follows.- and yes, I mulched heavily and thoroughly this spring, but wind evaporation is a thing.  That nice loose lagoonage turns into little hard feathers in the heat, and the clay soil (yes, heavily amended over the years but give me a fuckin' break already I live four feet below sea level in what was once a shallow lake and clay is ionic and is gonna slip and slide through everything come winter, rain, and the movements of the earth) dries hard and cracks.  Those cracks can sever roots.  This is the shit you have to put up with on clay soil.  So when I water in, I make sure to flood all that lagoonage into the gaps in the soil so that SHIT DON'T DIE Y'ALL.  This is the part about ornamental gardening that most 'snippity snip' garden sites don't mention, so read it here and take heed.  It's a goddamn battle out there.  An ornamental garden is a crop.    The same struggles you face in food farming are no different than the ones you face with any planting, particularly a display garden made up of large perennial borders (mine.)ANYWAY.So I'm out there with the hose going at 'firefighter' velocity ramming the water into my clay soil at freaking midnight and I don't give a fuck. It's what you have to do.  I do it in men's clothing.  A wife beater, cargoes and Crocs.  Yes. I am repping for the Bi Folk in the dead of the night in my charming rural idyll.Oddly, all my roses are loving this heat. and that's odd given I have Star roses and Weeks roses, both of which lines are known to drop leaves and languish and bitch and scream and get black spot during hot weather.  I attribute this to the fact that I fed and watered twice weekly throughout the spring.  Even my shrubs and miniatures are happy (Weeks and Star) and even the ultra miniatures are going great guns, and I don't even know who bred those or what the hell their lineage is because I bought them outside of supermarkets and all the tags said was 'Super Mini'.  (Try looking that shit up online.  I dare ya.)  The one miniature I prize is 'Coffee Bean' which I have front and center here at the Rancho.  It's a Weeks Rose, and its normal sized counterpart is 'Hot Chocolate' which I also have, and is also a Weeks Rose.  Both are losing their minds, flourishing, stealing cars, robbing old ladies, eating dogs and writing bad checks.  Now, Weeks roses are notorious for having a really insipid 'cotton candy' fragrance.  Not so 'Hot Chocolate' or 'Coffee Bean.'  You get a true rose aroma, not rich but true.  I cannot recommend them highly enough.All my dwarf bulb lilies have gone off and are finished now, a month ahead of time.  Again, it's the unnaturally high temps that brought them on.  They did look lovely, and they held their own and weren't in any way harmed; they just blossomed early.  Like the daylililies, they came on paler than usual.My tall bulb lilies are beginning to open.  Media Orange came on first.  Next came 'Saracen Red' which is fighting my Rosa Mundi for it's star turn.   There is a species of orange bulb lily that's grown for it's edible bulb in the Orient - of course I have it - and it's coming on now, in profusion!  Imagine your average tall tiger lily.  Now imagine it perfectly in proportion, only a foot tall.  That's this edible species, and it's an absolute delight.The tigerlilies are beginning to develop buds.  I expect to see the first of them any day now.  Some are six feet tall!  They are the harbingers of Midsummer, and for me they always hold a little yearning, a little poignance, because they mark the turning of the season.  High Midsummer blossoms.  In the fall, the bulbils that form in the leaf axils will feed the field mice.That's about it, really.  We've had company, we've had parties, we've had naked babies laughing and sitting in the tickly grass, we've made new acquaintances and I've squirted a lot of little kids with the hose.  There's been fireworks and friendly tweakers and good  music and excellent beer.  Summer has been the antidote to last winter, and I feel like my soul can rise up again and carry on."},

Bog bodies and water burials3. Ancient manuscripts.Man, bring that shit ON.Two books that changed my life, out of many, are the Lindisfarne Gospel and 'Civilization and Disease'.  Yes. I know how to party.In my travels through YouTube I found something I've heard about but never seen anything much in detail to explore:  The water burials of the New World.Now the water burials of the Old World?  I am all over that shit.  Jam some sharpened hazel wickets through that dead sonofabitch and wham him/her down into the mud on the bottom of that pond there.  Why?  BECAUSE.And that's the only reason I've been able to glean from the sources I've been able to find so far.  Why in God's name pollute a known supply of water with a dead person?  The same people who would scoop a dead dog or what have you out of a backwater would hammer some poor dead bastard into the very bottom of a pond, with or without offerings, and then continue to cheerfully use that source for drinking water.Human stupidity fascinates me.____________________________Back years ago, it was the Lindisfarne Gospels that inspired me to take a calligraphy class, and to continue to practice it over the years.  Now Miss Scarlet has surpassed me in talent and sureness of hand, but I keep my hand in; I still make up my own alphabets and mix my own ink.  The best recipe I've found so far is - seriously - egg white, instant coffee, and a little Elmers glue - just a dot - and a little water until you have a nice flow.  It is astounding how long instant coffee lasts as an ink.  And it's the most lovely brown, or black, or tan - it already looks aged.  The egg white and glue stabilize the color.  I have things I've drawn and written from years ago that still look fresh.  Of course they aren't hanging on the wall in full sunlight either, but I used a wash of the same recipe, heavily diluted, to coat the collage of Civil War era sheet music that I used to paper my dining room wall with, and it's remained stable for over fifteen years.  Of course once it was all dry I coated it with a mixture of spar varnish with a smidge of instant coffee, and that probably had a lot to do with it.  Still, lovers of patina take note.  If you want the recipe and the method, just ask.___________________________Two of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse came to visit me yesterday because they were going to be going off to Lake Chelan for the next four days and wanted to - and I quote 'Say goodbye to my garden.'I melted.I lead them around on a quick tour - now that Flaming June is past, July is struggling to hold her own against record high temperatures, so I've been watering in the gloaming.  Things are holding up bravely, and it looks good out there. These two little guys just roamed around wondering at all the plants that were taller than them, smelling leaves, asking what was what, looking at all the different birds who have decided to make my garden their home, marvelling at the butterflies and all the different types of bee, and trying to sneak things into their mouths.The older of the brothers rode off on his bike, and I was going indoors when I heard the sound of sandals slapping behind me, and turned to find the littlest one following me around.\"Well what are you still doing here?\" I asked.\"I had to say goodbye to your garden because, because I'm going to miss it,\" he said.  \"I'm going to be in Chelan for four days.  We get to stay in a bunkhouse.\"Now I knew immediately where he was talking about.  It's a place called Dry Falls, and it's a really nice place, like an oasis in the desert, with tall, tall reedbeds and long docks, paddle boats and swimming.  The reason it's called 'Dry Falls' is because, back in the Mezecrejurrassic period it had been a vast, vast semicircular falls, draining into a huge lake and from there into the waterway that would become the Whatever It's Called river.  Now, it's a low place surrounded by sharp mesas on three sides, punishingly hot, but with the coldwater seep there to cool off in, and the long, rock-shaded evenings to take the sting off the long dry days.  It's a place that the Biker and I have visited, and while it's not an exciting location, it's very serene, and the sky at night is it's own definition, defying all description of beauty and wonder.But this little dude, maybe in second grade, came to say goodbye to my garden.  And when I finally herded him off, he turned around and said 'Thank you!\"\"Thank you for what?\" I laughed.\"Thank you for your garden!\" he said.Kids, that right there, those five words, that's the meaning of my life."},

If I give the Biker a bit of good advice about something - doesn't matter what, and it's never the same thing, never happens according to a schedule, just out of nowhere - he will talk over me and talk over me until I shut up;  ignore what I said, continue on his merry way, make the mistake that I tried to advise him would in fact happen, and then have the unmitigated nerve to get pissed off at me as though I'd planned it.2. If I happen to mention that I like a movie or video or a piece of music that he hasn't seen or heard first, he will immediately say \"Oh, I don't like that.\"\"Have you seen it?\"\"I just don't like things like that.\"\"This is just like (other things he likes) though.\"\"I just said I don't like it.  That's it.\" And he'll be miffy about it.Say six months or so go by.  I walk into the room and the Biker is enthusiastically enjoying the very thing I tried to tell him about earlier.  I will advise him of this fact.\"I never said I didn't like it,\" he'll maintain, and then scramble for a way to re-word what he said on the occasion to make it seem as though I'd simply misunderstood him.These incidents used to cause huge screaming fights, back when I gave a fuck who won or lost that kind of fight.  Now, I just let it stand.  Just drop the mic. Agree to disagree.This gets a  little Dickensian now.Back when I was a kid, I was branded a liar.  And there were certain sadistic members of my family who used to glory in the power they held over me by changing the facts of any matter, big or small, consequential or trivial, from one day to the next.  Make the funny monkey angry!  What an idiot!  What a laugh!  Look at her cry!There was one person in particular who had several damn good reasons for wanting me silent.  This person had it in for me.  This person was an adult.  This was a person who would go behind my back and tell my friends parents, even my friends, that I couldn't be trusted, and to just, you know, take everything I said with a little ol' grain of salt. Big twinkly \"Kids, huh? Whaddya gonna do?\" grin. First and worst among my imagined sins, I, as an adopted infant, had failed to save this persons marriage or to provide this person with fulfilment.  This adult was a compulsive shoplifter, a slip-and-fall artist, a credit scammer, a bringer of false lawsuits,  had emptied out my trust account as well as my savings account, and...had a few, lets say, favorite little games and private proclivities when it came to exploiting my youth and innocence.For years, if you wanted to make me instantly enraged, and I mean angry enough to cause property damage, you accused me of lying, or that what I remembered had simply never happened. I used to jack people up against walls and get violent, too.  One glance. Watch out.It still angers me.  But now I am 61.  I also have Prozac, valium, beer, and my own money.  The power dynamic has shifted.  I have certainty now.  And to forestall those people who like to play fast and loose with my certainly, I keep records here and there.  Sometimes, I'll say something, and just get that feeling \"you know, this is going to get turned around on me...\" and I will write that event down.  Nine times out of ten it's nothing, but it makes me feel better to have it recorded, like giving a little kid a hug of reassurance that everything will be OK.  Sometimes, there really IS a monster in the closet.This sounds paranoid.  It's been played as paranoia too.  And here's what happened when that shit was tried:  I knew what I knew.  As hard as my adversary tried to sneak and slither and slide and twist the facts of the event, I had solid documentation.  (So much for my ex-husbands protestations of innocence, the psychotic little fuck.)Now oddly enough, I learned this method of being my own advocate and backing myself up from, of all the unlikely places, Scientology.My ex-husband is a staff member of the \"church.\"  He wrangled me in, yet I was nobody's fool, and just kind of kept my own counsel and stood around in amazement that all these seemingly average people believed in such utter, utter horseshit.  I was there to keep my marriage together, and then realized that the marriage was just as big a steaming pile of shit as the \"church\" and it's dogma was, and left.  Toodle-oo!  Easiest escape from the \"church\" ever.  I just walked out the front door and never went back.Scientology is big on collecting and maintaining personal records and then grinding those records into the faces of people who try to fuck with them.  There is a huge segment of the \"church\" dedicated to drawing the most personal information out of their 'parishioners,' tabulating it, backing it up, and saving it in different locations.  I saw this method work on members of the public who had gone in, ostensibly for counselling, but when they had grown skeptical and began to question, had all the information they had divulged in private sessions brought out and laid in front of them, with attorneys present.  After all, it was a 'church'.  There was never any promise of confidentiality made.  And that was your voice on tape, your words on paper, your image and your voice on the film they'd taken of you; timestamped, with witnesses.It worked. Oh holy God did it work.It's one of the reasons that I started blogging.  I wanted the stories that I remembered about my past in a place where they weren't secret any more, in a place where I could go back and read about a particular event and know that I'd remembered that event correctly.  It's been a Godsend on a number of occasions.  One of them recent.If I am wrong about any particular thing, then I apologize.  No skin off me.  I learned something. I was wrong, and I got straightened out for free.  Life isn't always that merciful.  I accept it with gratitude.The hardest thing to let go of is gloating.  Man, gloating is (actually a really sucky thing to do and improves nothing) a blast and I love it.  It's a personality flaw.  I try not to give in. So what I do is go into the bathroom, close the door, and then quietly jump up and down and celebrate and do my victory dance in front of the mirror until the feeling passes.  Then I flush the toilet, wash my hands, and emerge radiating decorum and maturity.This is on a good day, understand.  On a bad day?  Oh man, it's stupid.  I'm really hoping I'll outgrow this shit eventually.But I WAS right!"},
{"title": "I Want To Ride My Bicycle, I Want To Ride My Bike", "date": "Monday, June 21, 2021", "text": "On our travels we came across a stone stock, vitange Schwinn Collegiate three-speed and bought it for thirty bucks.  My husband figured he would be the one to ride it, but as it turns out, he has Rotating Vibrationals and does not belong on anything except shoes. (Think of the headrush you get sometimes when you stand up too fast, and up the intensity by ten.  This is a thing that happens to him. I cannot for the life of me remember what it's called, so it's been Rotating Von bar-martials, Reverbing Falls, and basically means that he'll get about five steps away from the chair he'd been sitting in for over an hour and suddenly collapse in a heap of Bikerage.)This means that the perfection that is a mans vintage Schwinn is all MINE.These were fantastic bikes.  The slender bar frame means it responds to a twitch of the handlebars or the hips, a surprisingly nimble and light bike coming from the Schwinn Tank Factory.  Today for some God-unbeknownst reason I decided to hop on that sapsucker and take it for a spin.Man, the thrill is still there.I was able to ride that thing all over town, like nothing, like flying. Effortlessly.  Oh, it needs some adjustment of the handlebars and the seat, but it has the 'flick' shift, and this blue dream goes along and ignores the state of the road. Like I said, adjustments need to be made, but after more years than I can remember offhand, I'm on a Schwinn again, and it's a quality Schwinn, made for commuting, and it's like riding a dragonfly. You skim over the pavement.  It was 80f today (Hot, for my UK buds) and I didn't even crack a sweat, children!  And the sheer joy of being back on a bicycle again - !When I was in grade school, I was cursed with a vast, horrifying Columbia bike.  Nowadays the fucking thing would be worth upwards of  $1500.00, but at the time it was embarrassing and ugly and it got stolen a lot and vandalized because it was so very uncool.  It was my albatross.It was also the thing that built up my muscles and bones while I was still growing, manouvering that heavy, leaden, ugly beast around.  I probably owe my current state of osteo-health to that bastard of a bike, that horrible embarrassment of a klunker, a thing so heavy that once I got it up to speed the pedal brakes would shriek.  And when it was stolen, that's how I could tell where it was in the neighborhood, come to that.God that bike embarrassed me, and I was not a popular kid to begin with.  I can't count the times I found it lying in a field, or on a dirt hill, the air let out of the tires, the handlebars turned around, and have to walk it back home.  I'll skip the Dickensian shit and just say that I took the blame for what other kids did to that bike.  Every single time.  Even when someone grabbed it out of my hands, or crashed into me and knocked me to the ground and took it.  The fucking thing always ended up back in our garage, and I always ended up riding it to school every day, and having to park it down at the very end of the rack.So much for that.  For Christmas, when I was 13, I was given a boys (I insisted) ten-speed Schwinn. The thing was just as heavy as my Columbia, but it had the right look.  Add ramhorn handlebars and a generator headlight and suddenly, I was acceptable.  I was also 13, and went to school five miles away from my house, so it was very, very seldom indeed that I rode the thing to school.  But it never got stolen, and I was never ragged for owning it.  I could park it in the rack and other kids would park their bikes next to it.  That thing was all right.It went to another owner when I moved out and into Portland.  Back then, Portland Oregon was not a bike friendly city, and it was just taking up space in my apartment, serving no purpose.Boy, today, on that bike, it felt So Right.  And where I live is dead level, too.  I have a basket for it; I can actually ride it to places and do errands with it, and I'm planning on doing that.Man, like flying.  Just like flying. Like no time has passed at all."},
{"title": "The Wages Of Being A Dork", "date": "Sunday, June 20, 2021", "text": "I love fireworks.  I mean I LOVE fireworks. Any and all fireworks, from paper poppers (not a party cracker  but a little tissue paper thingie that you can throw at people to be annoying, and when it hits them there is a tiny little explosion) to military grade reports and everything in between.  Hell, give me a sparkler to run around with and I am a happy bunny ffs.This is pretty much me right here.Yesterday was Sumas Community Day, which kicks off a couple of months of rodeos, horse shows, baseball tournaments, greased pig scrambles and mutton busting.  It all begins with a car Show and Shine, and a little community parade which is, frankly, adorable, and consists of decorated tractors and fire engines, vintage farm equipment, people in convertibles and people dressed up as Heaven knows what, or just whole families wandering along waving, come one, come all.  Most of the drivers carry huge bags of candy and shower the audience with the stuff if the little kids make that \"toot toot\" gesture that looks like a power salute.  The drivers will blow their horns, run the sirens, rev the engine, and the kids get bonked in the head with lollipops and everyone loves it.  Fun fact:  more farm equipment than you'd expect have horns!  Like harvesters!  I guess...there are places in the world where this kind of thing is necessary.  And that old steam powered farm equipment will take the shingles off the roof when they cut loose with the steam whistles, man.In the evening around 10:30 there is a fireworks display in the sports arena.  We here at Rancho FirstNations have the best seat in the house right from our front porch, and I have a nice old park bench set up for sittin' and sippin', and we just 'lax back and watch.Well, the Biker does.  I stand up and scream like a madwoman after every particularly impressive burst.I will also shout \"SET SOMETHING ON FIRE\" when there is too long a lag between displays, and other helpful advice, like \"PULL YOUR THUMB OUT!\" and my personal favorite \"COME ON YA CHEAP BASTARDS, IS THAT IT??\"Now I am not the only person in town by a damn stretch who is doing this, so I don't feel like the Lone Idiot.  This year there were people standing on their roofs, and lots of kids out running around town with sparklers and bottle rockets, and they all had something to say, loudly, as did their parents.  And you can hear the crowd at the sports grounds cheering like Romans watching an elephant eat a Christian.  It's a fantastic time, and yeah, you do feel like a community after all that.  We're still small enough for that, thank God.This morning I am croaking like a toad.  My voice is shot.  I pride myself on my 'Sustained Yee-Oo! Of Approval', a sound that comes right up from my toes and impresses everyone who hears it with how cool I am and how much they want to be just like me when they grow up.  You can literally hear it all over town, I've been told.  This makes me very proud.  It also makes me talk funny the next day.This year the City display did not last for the usual 45 minutes.  We had to set up fireworks display donation sites in all the stores, and between that and Covid the city could only afford 15 minutes, and it was bought locally in standard 'Big Display' cartons that you purchase on one of the NA reserves nearby and then smuggle out.  Luckily, the farmers just down the road (and just out of city limits) laid down a couple grand and bought five Big Display cartons, along with a couple of big reports and a 'Special', which is that huge, final, rooty-toot firework that just dazzles and amazes you, and so Christmas was saved!   We got our full 45 minutes, and it was really, really cool.And the best thing?  WE BLOW SHIT UP ALL OVER AGAIN ON THE 4TH OF JULY!!!!_____________________________Our little towns' claims to fame are twofold. 1. The flavor of our drinking water - this is no lie.  It's actually up on our 'Welcome to Sumas' signs (Voted Best Tasting Water 2000)  although what that standard is and who they're comparing it with, like Flint, Michigan or the bottom of a flooded mine I do not know, but apparently our Mayor thinks this is a big draw.  2. Our rodeo events and horse shows.  We're part of the amateur rodeo circuit, and so the horse and bull riding is particularly raw.  I've never attended.  The Biker attended once because he knew one of the riders, and he lasted long enough to see the dude get thrown, then split.  Not a big fan of blood sport here at Rancho FirstNations.  Not even the kid events, like mutton busting and greased pig scrambles.  It's just crude amusement at the expense of someone else's (or some animals') discomfort.I have no idea what the horse events consist of, because I am uninterested in horses.  I am in the minority.  The whole town turns out for them, and people come in from all over the map to compete in, I don't know, dressage or roping or whatever the hell you do.  Maybe they dress them in costumes or something.  Maybe it's a Ponyplay event.  If so, my decision to stay home is particularly sound, because ew.All during those events the town is inundated with tall, thin old men with serious spinal issues, wearing checkered shirts with pearl snap buttons, belt buckles the size of salad plates, Wranglers, and cowboy hats.  Their wives are either vast, fat things with legs wrapped in ace bandages, or sunburnt twists of pepperoni, and really repping for their 'All country all the time' thing with red-check shirts, red bandanas,  ponytails and high-heeled cowboy boots - it's a thing that's hard to describe to a non-American. Think of it as the highly feminized version of what their husbands are wearing, and add a gold crucifix necklace.         Imagine this lady, only she's sixty, super suntanned, and that dress covers her knees.No matter what they're dressed like, they spend money like crazy, and everyone benefits.  They all stay in immense travel busses on the grounds and they do whatever they do.  Come nightfall, the ladies all settle in with the Bible, or maybe 50 Shades of Grey, and their husbands come into town and just chuck down the booze at the local (outdoors-mountain-hunting themed) bar like they'll never make booze again.  And those old tore up cowpokes get to partying some hard out in the beer garden, too.  They don't drink no Ketel One or Blue Agave or cinnamon flavored Jack - they drink Man Booze.  The Famous Grouse.  Canadian Club. Johnny Walker. I mean damn, do they drink that shit.  And then they'll walk on back to the grounds, right down the middle of the street, playing up, and that's how it goes for a couple of weeks.  It is a real, 21st century rootin' tootin' sure nuff Old West Town.  No matter the fact it was founded on gold and not cows - it roots, and it toots, and guns are fired, and rotgut is consumed, and the womenfolk hold down the homestead.And I do garden tours!"},
{"title": "Shaking Things UP", "date": "Friday, June 18, 2021", "text": "I have been having a terrible problem with boredom for the past few months.  It's chemical, and it's caused by a drug called Quietipine (sp?) which yes, will keep you from having a psychotic  break, but only because it makes you so sleepy and dull and uninspired that you can't muster up the ambition to do anything florid.  At least, if you're me. Your results may vary.It played it's part, and it helped, and now I'm off it and the difference is remarkable.  Now, I can get through the day and remain interested and engaged.  Under the influence of Quietipine, every day around 10:AM to 1:PM I would fall into a hopeless pit filled with 'You  might as well end it, things are hopeless and it won't change.'Knowing that's not true helps.  Knowing that's not true over a period of almost a year? Well. That fortitude begins to erode.  You know that every day you will lose at least two hours to anxiety and despair, or to lying in a dark room to cut stimuli to an absolute minimum while you chant 'One relax, two relax, three relax, four relax....\" and remember to give yourself that 'compassionate forgiveness' you're supposed to give yourself when those intrusive thoughts interrupt your little mantra.  That shit is an effort.  Your mind wants to stay in tandem with your emotions, and your emotions are driven by chemical reactions to stimuli, and when that stimuli is dulled, your higher mind, the one that knows better and sees that nothing is really wrong in your world, loses ground, inch by inch.Well.  Enough of that shit.  I'm off the Quietipine and suddenly I have ideas and strategies and my mind is not full of mud.  The first thing I did was to change up my entertainment choices.  I grew up a horror fan. The gorier and freakier the better.  (Anyone remember 'Phantasm'?  Yeah, I thought that was pretty awesome.  Stupid, I mean I'm not entirely without taste, but that was the road I travelled.  H.R.Gigers' \"Alien\" had me in transports of delight.)  Once I had my first child I could not do horror any more.  No way, shape or form.  Not true crime, not CSI, not nuttin'. That's changed, come to find out.I decided to treat myself to a late night double feature (Frank and Rocky, Brad and Janet....) of Alien Takeover horror and Supernatural horror. (What ever happened to Fae Wray?)It WORKED.The Biker went to bed and I was on Netflix.Here are a few conclusions I've come to in my quest for decent modern horror.1. The Brits do horror like nobody's business.  They have the best fake blood, the best camera angles, the best actors and the strangest, most messed-up stories.  They know when to show you the monster, and how much of the monster, and when to hide the fucker. They don't rely on jump-scares. They know that the horror that is only partially seen is scarier than the monster that lumbers through the whole damn film, every scale and drop of mucus detailed lovingly. 2. Anything that relies on hallucinations isn't worth your time.  It's like the cheat \"and then the little boy fell out of bed and woke up.\"  It's lazy storytelling and plays the viewer for a fool.3. Brits have a real thing about barf, parasites and being cocooned. I don't know why this is.  Ask your mother.4. A shitty, unhappy ending only works if you've been coerced into sympathizing, even a little bit, with the monster.  Otherwise it's just abusing your audience, who are there, after all, to be entertained, not sent into a weeklong drug and drink binge. 5. Stephen King, for the most part, really hates his audience.6. If it's Spanish, pass.7. If it's Japanese...well, that's a matter of personal taste.  I tend to find Japanese horror distancing.  It is, however, gorgeously crafted stuff.8. Unless you are H. R. Giger, you cannot make a monster that will provide the same fright/shock/horror value every time it's shown.  And H. R. Giger, sadly, has passed.  Keep that monster in the shadows, partially obscured, seen in glimpses.9. Possession is an overworked trope and it makes me yawn.10. Everybody knows five minutes into any given film that stars teenage protagonists exactly what's going to happen, to whom, why, and when. Add some humor, add a twist, like Cabin In the Woods, that's OK, that's entertaining.  But personally, I have a hard time sympathizing with teenager-horror.  (\"Let's hide in the abandoned abbatoir!  Sure!  And what the hell, let's get high, wander off from the group, make a lot of noise, and fuck.  It's just a high risk situation, after all!')I am thrilled that I can once again watch horror movies and stay at a personal remove from the action.  Just a hairs' breadth, that's all it takes, and I lacked that for years.  Man, I am making up for lost time. The best one I've seen recently is 'The Ritual'.  It moves, it gives you just enough story, and you're guessing right up until the last scene.  Excellently done.The most perplexing has been 'Apostle'.  I mean, watch the thing, it's a gorefest and it's excellently icky, but there are so many loose ends that if it were a sweater you wouldn't be allowed to wear it out in public. Plus the protagonist, acting as a spy in the plot, is the skeeziest, most suspicious-looking human being I've ever seen.  If he walked into a store I owned I'd have him followed by security.  So there you go.  Stay up late some night with a good friend, or a good pillow to scream into, and get your socks rocked.    Dare ya!"},

With my endocrinologist.  Oh, our insurance paid 45.00 of that.-This same bill informs me that I am two months in arrears.  TRY SENDING THE BILL IN THE MAIL SO I'LL RECEIVE THE MOTHERFUCKER, how about.  Great!  Just GREAT!  I had an impeccable credit rating.  I paid the whole thing down tout de suite and came back home glowering. Then:-I finally get in touch with my old psychiatrist (The beloved Dr. Thang Do, who can do no wrong) who is retiring, and find that a. He and his lovely wife are moving to Hawaii FOREVER because he is retiring, and b. he will not refill my Adderall scrip because he c. wants to wean me off another medication so that d. when I am transferred to the care of his successor, she won't geek out when she sees that I've been given both downers and an upper.  I only use the Adderall in very, very limited amounts at infrequent intervals, when I'm faced with a lot of grown up activities and issues and need the focus.  I take a pediatric dose, in fact.  I understand completely where he is coming from.  It took he and I several years to build up a relationship where he felt comfortable leaving me to pick and choose what additives and preservatives I needed to get through life, and I'll have to build up the same kind of thing with his successor.  but....AGGGGH.  Then,-I had to call and make a preliminary appointment with his successor, which cannot be done with one simple phone call.  Oh no.  I have to talk to her, then go online, with both computer and phone at the ready, and open an account on Patients Portal, where all the paperwork and general office bullshit is handled, and-THE MOTHERFUCKER IS SPUN.I cannot describe the gyrations and horror I went through trying to get an account opened on this fucking 'streamlined, time saving, simple and accurate' piece of shit lame ass slow claggy glitchwad of a portal.  So, I...-Had to call Patients Portals helpline.-Cue more horseshit.  Luckily, after a rocky start where our phones decided whether or not they needed to use a condom,  I reached a very patient, kind and competent young man with a voice that could melt sheet steel and a lovely way of expressing himself, and together we mucked our way through the swamp of poor website design and slow servers and bad code that is Patients Portal and finally, finally, I was able to establish an account, and I only shouted 'FUCK' seven times.  The poor guy was laughing so hard by the end that I felt we'd established a real rapport.Sermon follows.     I always make it known to help center personnel that I understand that they are not the authors of my disgruntlement, and try to be mannerly and kind to those poor kids while explaining that I am 61 and have no patience with this crap.  And I always, always go out of my way to praise them to the skies when the deed is finally accomplished, because those calls really are monitored by their supervisors - I used to do call center work, and I know.  If some poor kid gets my drama on the line and can manage to drag me through all the barbed wire and landmines to a solution, you BET I praise that kid to the skies by the name they give me so they'll get a good review.  You should do the same.  I've been a call center terminal.  It's thankless.  You're the flack catcher. Be kind to your call center friends! 'Cause a duck may be somebody's mother! Be kind to your friends in the swamp! Where the weather is very, very, domp!

GIGER 'ALIEN' SHIRT!  It's been a damn month.  They've already asked me online for feedback, and children?  I GAVE THEM FEEDBACK.  I held my electric guitar right up next to those stacks, cranked it up to eleven, and set it on fire. Oh, they got some damn feedback.  I'm expecting a check.  Will I ever see it?  Who's to say?  It's only 30.00 fuckin' dollars, RIGHT????-Interwoven with all this kerfuffle is the sad fact that my cell phone and I don't get along At All.  And all during this kerfuffle my cell phone played an integral role, because nothing can be simple any more. You can't just pick up a phone and talk to a person and then things happen and you get a letter and it's all done.  No.  I won't even go into the sheer aggravation and dislike that exists between myself and the little wafer of dodgy technology that everything in the fucking 21st century seems to hinge upon.  It's TRAGIC.-I went to bed early last night after a heavy meal that dropped me like a stunned rabbit. I woke up and went out into the living room to watch a little comedy, get right, wait to get sleepy again, when all of a sudden I heard a sound which was for all the world as though someone had slit open a ten pound bag of rice and slung it against my windows.  I ran to look out the front door and it was raining hayrakes and pitchforks, just straight down from the skies, and it was as tepid and dank as the locker room at the YWCA.  I stood on the front porch and could not see across the street.A little rain is good.  A little more is fine.  A whole metric shitload in the middle of late Spring is not so good.  I had to go out and mow the lawn this afternoon because I swear that rain drew the grass up out of the ground like a snakecharmers' flute.  Yes, Mr. Inexplicable DeVice can laugh; I had buttercups all over hells half acre out there.  Not now, of course.  Oh hail no.  -If I go and use the hose bib at the back of the house, I get dive bombed by a white crowned sparrow who has established a nest in the pink lonicera nearby.  If I open my front room window, I get called shitty names by a white crowned sparrow who is building a nest in the clematis jackmanii growing right alongside that window.  If I walk under my weeping alder, I get called a commie pinko fag by the white crowned sparrow who has nested in it's canopy and brooks no invaders.  That made trimming that alder back a real adventure.  Man, that was one pissed off tiny birdie.  I trim my weepers on the Vitruvian rule:  Muk is the measure of all things.  It's not like I'm cloud pruning and disrupting shit.  These are just agitated little over-caffeinated birds who need to shut up. -I have a house sparrow building a nest in my campsis radicans, the one that leans on my shed.  It might actually have a clue and leave me alone. Then again, it might be partying with the hummingbirds, crowned sparrows and hornets and take an attitude. Cocaine is a hell of a drug. Only dopes take dope.  Just say no.-I have a mole the size of a cock-sucking Tonka truck tunneling underneath my back yard.  This thing throws up hills the size of Vesuvius and has cut channels from the back fence to my house.  I stick the hose down it's tunnels and blast the fucker?  It just comes up somewhere else.  It's been a while since I had anything bigger than a vole out here, and I am considering evil solutions.No. Do no attempt to save me from myself, gentle reader. This is MY GARDEN.  It may be a sweet wee fuzzy rodent with paddly paws and a cute pointy nosie, but the fucker must die before it finds a girlfriend.Infamy!  Infamy! They all got it in fa' me!"},
{"title": "A Visit From The Four Horsemen", "date": "Sunday, June 13, 2021", "text": "Rancho FirstNations, still repping for Uncle Joe. It is a lovely, warm, rainy day here, and we've been lolling around holding down the furniture for the better part of the day.  This is the best kind of rain - warm, a little breeze, just the air moving.  The worst thing that can happen to the garden this time of the year is a fog - still, stale and rank. Mildew spreads over the leaves of plants like frost and can only be stopped, not prevented.  But in a gentle rain, all the parts of the plants are washed off, the dust carried away, and no soil is splashed up.  All the smells of the garden gather together, shaken out by the droplets falling on the petals, and the breeze carries them into the house, and I swear to God it smells like honey and roses, and it's rich and warm and wonderful,  outside and inside my house.  What a fantastic lazy day.The rain has also brought on my calendulas, and they are doing their part, filling in the gaps that the aquilegia are leaving as they go to seed, the saturated orange so close to the ground that it tempers the overwhelming greenness of the rest of the gardens' foliage.  The japanese mugwort and the needle-lace artemesia is coming in tall and silver too, and that takes away another bit of the dominance of green so that what I have is not just a sheet of green with dots of color, but every color.  It is downright gaudy out there, and I love it.Pulling for the team is Campanula Glomerata.  (You can see it in the picture above, that line of bright blue flowers in the middle there.) It comes up with a fuzzy stem and leaf, and the blossoms are the loveliest shade of gentian blue you can imagine - and it spreads by stolons.  You get a globe of glorious blue atop a sturdy stem, and if you deadhead that once the petals wither, another globe of bell-shaped blossoms will grow out of the next whorl of leaves further on down the stem.  I use it as a margin in some places and as a filler in others.  The great thing about it is that if you don't like where it is, you can yank it right out of the ground, no fighting, no digging -  pop off the blossom and plant it in another location - and in a week it will have seated itself and will be throwing out blossoms, just that easy.Just beginning to blossom is Primula Missouriensis.  I use it the same way I use Campanula Glomerata. It is the same height, and has the same growth habit - spreads by stolons, masses like a champ, can be transplanted effortlessly.  It, however, comes up with a shiny green leaf, it has a bright vermillion flower bud, and it's saturated Pantone yellow blossoms form a corona.   Like the C. Glomerata, once the blossoms fade, you pop them off and another one blooms on the next whorl of leaves on down the stem.  This is an astounding plant to use around the bare ankles of a deep pink or orange rose.  I have it standing guard around the base of 'Pink Fairy' and also 'Cinco de Mayo' - where it really, really shines as a combination planting.  'Cinco' has a deep green, shiny leaf too, and the sexy orange and apricot, diamond-dusted blossoms just love that rich yellow and those vermillion buds.________________________________I had a visit from the Four Horsemen of the  Apocalypse yesterday (four little boys who are obsessed with my garden.)  I was apprised of their arrival by one of the shouting 'LOOK AT THIS!' about fifty times - which I ignored because little boys.  I looked up when he said \"HEY MRS. FIRSTNATIONS LOOK AT THIS!\" and then I had to come over and see what was in his hand.\"ITS A DEAD BIRD HEAD!\" he shouted, unnecessarily.And it was a dead bird head.  Hemisected.  Like a knicknack from Ed Geins house.  Half an empty cranial cavity like a bowl, one empty eye socket and half a long upper beak.  You don't see that every day.\"Honey, never ever pick up dead animals,\" I said to him. \"Dead birds have a really bad disease called salmonella that can make you throw up for a whole week. Please drop that and run go wash your hands right now,\" I said, being a grandma.Well, he ran off, I went back to pulling out hogweed, and suddenly I have four little boys in my garden.  They all have questions.  Is this the same thing as that?  Where did this come from?  What are these kind of bees? and I said \"OK now.  I'm going to cut each one of you a nice bouquet to take home to your mom, OK?\" very cheerfully.  \"You have to take turns, but you get to pick out the flowers!\"This worked Like A Charm.  Four mannerly little savages trooped around with me and picked out flowers for their Mom Bouquet (I had to explain the meaning of the word 'bouquet' ) and then  I told them \"Run home quick now and tell your mom to put these in a glass of water so they'll last!\"  And off the streaked, and into the house I ran, and cracked a beer, and planted my ass on the sofa. Until I heard a noise in the back yard, and looked out the kitchen window, and saw a very little boy standing in my garden shed yelling \"MRS. FIRSTNATIONS?\" unnecessarily because it's a small shed and I'm a stocky lady.  (And I was wearing a bright blue and scarlet 'Skynet Labs Cybernetic Development Team' t-shirt.)\"Honey, you can't just run into my yard like this,\" I said, leading him out of the shed.  \"If you don't see me, you have to come to the front door and knock and ask for Mrs. FirstNations, OK?\"\"OK,\" he yelled.  \"MRS. FIRSTNATIONS?\"\"What, honey?\" I asked.\"CAN I COME IN YOUR BACK YARD NOW?\"\"No hon, I'm sorry, I'm going inside to rest now.  You go play with your buddies now.  I'll see you later,\" I said, leading him out of the yard again.  \"Bye!\"And on the way back to join his buddies, he picked up the damn dead bird head again."},
{"title": "THE HORROR", "date": "Friday, June 11, 2021", "text": "The nice man from the insulation company came by and gave us a wonderful cheap estimate!  I am so surprised - and stoked!  Maybe this won't be as painful as I thought?  But we still have the plumbing and electrical inspections left to pay for, and God, I know for a fact that the electricity in this joint is janky as hell.  Maybe the plumbing is fine. I know it needs heat tape and tube wrap. That's not horrible.  But the wiring in this place will probably scare the poor inspector shitless and we'll have to pay for his counselling on top of everything else.One jokes.  Still, in the words of the Bard, \"FUUUUUUUUUUUCK.\"I went into the attic today, headlamp on, flashlight at the ready, and discovered that the debris problem isn't that big of a deal.  It's just that I absolutely cannot do a damn thing to alleviate the issue. Why?  Because I have lung problems, and our attic is a goddamn biohazard site.  There are two starling nests the size of exploded hay bales, massive drifts of rat shit old and new, and dust, dust, dust from living in farm country and having no insulation and plenty of gaps for the wind and whatever it carries to blow right on in.  It's like this:  If I had gone up into my attic at high noon on a sunny day?  I would not have needed the headlight or the flashlight.It's the rats that piss me off the worst. That is a direct result of the animal hoarders who used to live next door.  All those tame and semi-tamed rats of theirs moved right on in to every house on the block after that house went up in flames, and I more than resent that.  I keep a tight goddamn house, and to see all that where it had not been prior to the Rat People moving out...?  Damn. I was really shocked. God help the Rat Person who comes back to the old neighborhood to visit. I will beat that persons ass with an aluminum baseball bat and call up a tattooist buddy of mine to scribe 'SKANKY RAT BASTARD' into his/her forehead.  Nasty, vile, horrible, screwed up, gross, disrespectful and creepy.  To think that I used to try and be a good neighbor to those fuckers and they were maintaining a goddamn Vat Of Plague one city lot away from my fucking kitchen!!!!I had live traps that I  put up in the attic to catch a raccoon last year.  Apparently, I caught two raccoons.  And apparently, by the horribly suggestive evidence, those raccoons were.... fuck it. They croaked and were eaten by rats.*  And shit out by rats.  All the way around every single trap.  I found a few scraps of hair.  So good news - the raccoons didn't lie up there dead and putrefying.  Bad news - their carcasses were eaten by what looks like a whole lotta rats. Right down to the bones. They just pulled the things out through the cages.  And that is fucked UP.It would be kinda cool if I was 13.  But I am 61 and it is not cool.  It is gross. But this is what happens when you not only live in farm country, but you live in farm country in a pre-statehood house that has no insulation, AND you had animal hoarders living next door for 21 years.Plus I found a dessicated bat.  It was hanging from the peak of the roof, and I shone my light on it and thought \"Aw, poor batty.\" I like bats.  They are helpful animals.  So being an idiot, I poked at it with a stick I was carrying to swoosh away all the cobwebs, and the bat turned into something like cigarette ashes and fluttered to the ground.I left the attic at this point.  The prospect of inhaling dessicated bat fragments did not appeal to me in any way, shape or manner.  I'm just weird like that. Snorting bat frag = no.We may have to hire someone to go up there and clean out the fuckin' attic.  Now could the Biker do this?  Yes, at risk of life and limb.  He is built for comfort, not for speed. And he is 61 too. I don't want him up there in hantavirus central, hell no.Those dollar signs, they just keep on stacking up.*Or the rats...no, I won't go there. But probably."},
{"title": "Hoist By Me Own Petard, ARRR", "date": "Thursday, June 10, 2021", "text": "Well, it happened, kats and kittens!  I got my insulation wish!Unfortunately it comes with a couple of stumbling blocks I had not foreseen.1. We may or may not still be running old 'knob and tube' cloth wrapped wiring.  And we may or may not be running it in scattered locations all over the fucking house.  This means that an electrician will have to come out and assess the situation, which means mucho dineros, which means I'm getting That Look from the Biker.2. There is a sizeable pile of general shit up in the attic that I've been working toward the access hatch for years.  See, long ago when refrigerators roamed the earth in herds, this house caught on fire AND had a tree fall on it.  Rather than huck out all the debris, a lot of what got torn off just got left lying up there between the fuckin' rafters. And after years of additions of dubious code quality, that crap got pushed out toward the eaves, where you have to lie on your back in all the dust and dessicated starlings and old mud dauber nests and hook it out.  It's at one end of the house.  It has to be hauled through a maze of old rafters for old roofs that are no longer in place to the main access hatch, which is where? At the other end of the house!RIGHT OVER WHERE I HAVE MY RODGERSEIA AND GIANT HOSTA 'SUM AND SUBSTANCE' IS WHERE PACO.There's old bricks from when this placed had a fireplace, and there's old plaster from when this place was fully plastered, and broken boards and just shit.  And the insulation dudes do not clean this shit out for you!  No they do not!  You  have to do this! I just went up in the attic.  Our house is the shape of a really stubby capital letter 'T'.  See that T?  The debris is at the bottom of the T.  I have to hook it out and drag it through a place where there are old rafters that are no longer being used, which is right around the intersection of the crossbar and the base, and then around that right angled corner, out the hatch and straight down INTO MY RODGERSEIA AND GIANT HOSTA 'SUM AND SUBSTANCE.'3. Our plumbing is probably scary.  And our plumbing needs to be heat-taped.  This means that we will need to have a plumber inspect our plumbing.  This caused the Biker to give me That Look as well.I figured shit, the insulation dudes will go up there, they'll scope out the situation, clear up all the debris, shoot in some insulation, check the walls to see which ones are balloon framed and which ones have fire stops, get it in all the nooks and crannies, down in those inside walls, make it nice and snug but NO. They drill some holes, they shoot in the crud, they stop up the holes, they leave. WITH A LARGE CHECK.I am pretty peeved by this for a number of reasons.  It's too late to bitch now, but this is looking more and more like 'polishing a turd' than it is 'being snug next winter.'If we sell out, yeah, we get a nice chunk of change.  And then we spend the rest of our lives in a shitty little apartment, with no yard, paying rent and utilities, because while land is in demand, rent is sky fucking high out here in Washington State, and The Fourth Corner, where we live, is one of the most expensive places to buy or rent in the United States right now.  That leaves moving to a cheaper state. And moving to a cheaper state, which, \"Hello stress my old friend, I've come to talk to you again, because a vision softly creeping, shit on my head and pissed on my car while I was sleeping....\"The only way I'm going to make it through another uninsulated winter in this house is if I get myself an opioid habit.  Or if I can be put into an induced coma and hibernate it out, because last winter almost did for me.  I am not joking.  Last winter was almost as frightening and stressful as getting a divorce was, and that shit sucked.________________________Meanwhile, the Biker is getting nothing but job interviews and job offers.  People here are crying for employees and nobody wants to work because they're laxin' back on their unemployment benefits, and these small businesses hit by Covid need workers and can't get them.  The Biker is holding out for a job with good benefits, and in this current job market he can actually do that, given his resume', which is astounding.  So there's a whole 'nother bunch of what ifs.I guess we wait for the estimates and then go from there.  GOD I HATE BEING A GROWNUP"},

(Shit, everybody else is.)My garden has absolutely exploded with color.  I live in the middle of a floral Gay Pride flag.  This is what my grandmothers generation called 'Flaming June', the first burst of real color all over the garden, while the early risers sink back and let the roses and other showstoppers take the stage.I planted the last three 'brought in' plants last week - three little perennial flowers (Two lobelia x speciosas Red Rocket and one Anise Hyssop) in a tall bucket that I mixed up a drainage medium for - I like to spotlight plants like this - and a Carolina Reaper chili.  Oh yeah!The whole Carolina Reaper chili plant is so spicy that you can't work with it without gloves!  All the parts are full of capsaicin, even the roots!  And the fruit tops out at 1,569,300 motherfucking Scovilles!  I cannot wait!!!!  I grew bird peppers one year and they had a flavor like pineapple and immanent death.  Harbaneros are delicious and sweet, almost floral.  There's a Yugoslavian pepper out there called a Goats' Horn that tastes like a mild green bell pepper and Satanism.  Years ago the Bikers' cousin grew those, and I showed off and ate a bunch of them out of hand and was immediately awesome and cool (we were at a redneck beach party and everyone on the bay thought I was The Shizz.)I gave in this year and grew two tomato plants:  Improved Early Girl and Black Prince, which is a selection you should try if you like a sweet tomato.  The fruit is on the smaller, saladette side.  It has a distinct red  wine flavor, too.  If you've ever had a Cherokee Purple tomato, you are familiar with that super rich, concentrated tomato flavor.  Black Prince has that, only sweeter, and you don't have to wait until the last gasp of summer to reward your efforts.I don't can, because when I can, the jars explode and fill my kitchen with botulism and broken glass.  So I freeze.  I have a huge upright deep freeze right in the kitchen so we can work out of it, and it's full of all the stuff I've grown in my garden.  What I like about freezing is 1. Nothing explodes, and 2. Whatever you've frozen thaws out and tastes as fresh as the day it was picked.  We spent cash dollars on the thing to get quality, so if the power goes out, nothing inside the thing even notices.  It's paid for itself so many times over it's stupid.I also have a dehydrator and that thing sees more use than you'd think.  Instead of using tomato paste, I dehydrate sheets of cooked, spiced and puree'd tomato until it's like cardboard, break it into pieces and seal it in jars.  You drop a chunk in, it melts, things taste good, you win, no can to pitch.  I do the same thing when I make my own garlic powder - I puree raw garlic, which I have in stupid abundance because it grows wild here - and then I BAKE it in the oven on low for an hour and half, stirring it until it goes from white to a medium tan color, and then I spread it out and dehydrate that in sheets.  Once that's dried, I run it through the food processor and then through a coffee bean grinder, and it is HEAVEN. I've already given armloads of raw garlic away.  Everyone where the Biker works is vampire proofed thanks to me.  If you guys lived closer you would be vampire proofed too.  So, let's get on that, shall we?  I'll let you shoot down my neighbors' drone with my wrist rocket!"},

Both of our grandmothers were named 'Rose'.  I had panic attacks in school too.  I sent her home with so many  rose petals that you could smell them on the breeze as she walked away.Chica the Staffie is full of joy and wants to spread the love.  She dances through the house and the yard, and Neighborhood Crackhead gets a little confused, and I lead her on out by her harness.  She's like a really buffed out two year old kid who never says 'No!' and doesn't try to stick shit in the light sockets.Giant Freakin' Hummingbird Moths are just what they sound like.  They are seriously nearly identical to real hummingbirds, down to the sound their wings make, but they have these fat, fuzzy, mothy bodies and they come in once the sun has gone behind the hills.  This freaks me right the fuck out.  All you can do is herd them along with a buggerwhapper until they figure out where the open door or window is.Giant Fucking Hornets are hatching right now.  The queen pupates in the soil over winter, and once the soil warms up and there's been a couple of rains, a huge fucking fat queen hornet the size of a Sigorsky will come buzzing in to inspect your house for nesting sites.  They die.  I blame France.Bumblebee Queens have just woke up in the dirt, dug their way out of the soil and have no fucking clue whatsoever.  They are huge, fat, furry and confused.  I catch them in a cup with a magazine postcard for a lid and let them go outside.  They are my buddies. They are native pollinators. They will fall asleep inside deep flowers when the sun sets, and in the morning you can tip them out into your hand, and the warmth of your body will wake them up slowly.  They walk around in your palm and then spread their little wings and buzz away.City of Sumas Employees, usually the utility dude or the police, will just stick their heads in and say 'Hello?' very loudly, as though we aren't sitting here in front of the television like elephant seals. The Utility Dude lets us know that something, like water, electricity or gas, is going  to be turned off.  The police usually just want to take a look around and tell you that they're checking up on 'kids in the neighborhood' which is bullshit, but this is a town on an international border and you have to expect that crap.  They know more about us than our doctors do.Random Small Children will poke their heads in and say \"Hello?\"\"Hi there,\" we'll say.\"Have you seen David?\"\"No, sweetheart.\"\"OK, Hi,\" they'll say. \"We're looking for David. He wasn't supposed to go farther than the light pole but he did and now we have to look for him.  OK Hi.\"  And then they leave.  I don't know what the repeated 'Hi' thing is about, but it beats \"We're here recruiting for the Klan\" and we have grandkids, so it's all cool.I say Mr. Rogers never had it this good."},
{"title": "Memorial Day", "date": "Sunday, May 30, 2021", "text": "We here in the U.S. are in the middle of Memorial Day Weekend.   Now, Memorial day  here in the land of the Free marks the official beginning of Summer, and every little kid in the neighborhood has been firing off illegal fireworks all days.  Memorial Day Weekend (a four-day weekend for most) was originally intended to be a time for family to go and decorate the graves of their kin lost to war, their military dead. Fireworks didn't used to be associated with it, just civic displays of floral arrangements and questionable decorations in the grocery stores, like styrofoam crucifixes dangling from the rafters.  No I am not kidding. My family would visit the cenotaph in the entry to Milwaukie City Hall and lay flowers for our honored deceased (there hadn't been enough left of them to fill a grave, is what I was told.) Then we would head straight for the Pioneer cemetery with implements of landscapial dominance held ready, and rip through the place, piling all the waste in an old sheet spread out on the ground to take away, while other families went around and stuck plastic flowers in the ground and then scrammed.It always made  me sad.  We weren't intrusive or loud.  We would begin at the very back corner and work our way forward.  So very few families would show up.  The military dead in the pioneer cemetery were marked (for the most part) by cast white metal stars on a stake, and their name, rank and serial number would have been pressed into the center.  This is what the military provided.  Their kin were supposed to swap these out for stones, but very few had the money to do so.  So very many of those graves went untended, the star blackening, lichen growing over the names.  Nobody remembered, or cared - although after the Spanish Influenza epidemic, whole families were wiped out, and so those boys sleeping there had  no living family to care.If my grandmother was successful in her bullying campaign, our whole extended fucked-up family would show up, uncles, fathers, wives and children, armed and ready to do battle with subsidence, fungus, canary grass and trees.  We owned the key to the caretakers vault, and inside there was multiple implements of garden care.  I always thought it was So Damn Cool that my family were the caretakers of all this history.  My dad and my uncles and male relatives would hit the military section of the little graveyard; setting the cast metal stars up straight and noting down the names and matching them up to their rightful plot, scubbing the metal with a wire brush and water with Comet mixed in.  They would set up the old 'Boot Hill' wooden markers left over from the Native and Pioneer conflicts; most of them had fallen over, rotted off at the dirt, and would go back into place another inch deeper into the ground.  They used Casein paint in the old days, which is like flint when it hardens.  You could read the neat names, dates and everything as though they  had been set in a few weeks past, even when they'd been lying face down on the ground.  If they were rotted off as far as the bottommost part of the epitaph the markers would be stacked against the fence, in order, in line with the row where they  belonged.Nobody came to replace the wood with stone.  The piles grew, year after year, and finally vandals broke in and stole them.In the 1970's the pioneer graveyard was under siege by the teenagers and  kids who lived in Waverly, just past the entrance to the graveyard, which was our towns bastion of the wealthy, a closed and gated community where all the movers and shakers lived.  I wonder if they knew that their kids were partying in the pioneer cemetery, burning candles, smashing markers with crowbars, levering over the tall granite columns, and stealing the old wooden markers and the military stars.  They would leave sledgehammer marks on the older stone slabs, and broke a few off at the cement base, never to be seen again.  I have wondered to this day what the fuck those kids did with that shit.  The only thing this kind of destruction betokened was that their parents were wealthy and they didn't have to care.  Nobody they knew was buried in the Pioneer Cemetery.  Their deceased lay in luxury, surrounded by rosebuds and baby's breath in perpetuity at the nearby Sellwood Mortuary, a beautifully landscaped few acres that held a series of Italianate chapels and mausoleums surrounded by elegant borders, specimen trees and shrubs, swans in pools, charming and poignant closes planted with weeping elm and alder.  The mausoleums were behind doors, separate little buildings faced with marble and other exotic stones laid in patterns, scented with flowers; and each one had it's specific population.  One devoted to the virginal dead,  another to infants, another for children,  another for novitiates and members of the clergy, the Jewish separate from the Christian, the Masons separate from the Catholics, The Red Men standing alone behind gates that enclosed tall pillars of Imperial Red Granite, and many more groups nestled together in their separate buildings and gardens. Separate in life, separate in death.The main building, the oldest and the most exquisite, reflected the pomp and conspicuous wealth of the early pioneer founders.  The Pittocks, the Dekums and others were spending eternity in a domed alabaster chapel that passed the light in tones of muted cream, and revealed the portrait busts of the sleepers atop tall plinths beneath the stained glass oculus high above.We had people resting in this place.  One of them was my uncle, who had taken one look at the Civil War after debarking from his immigrant ship in New Orleans and thought to himself 'Oh fuck no,' and had walked to Oregon Country, where he was hidden in my grandmother's carriage house until a plausible back story could be concocted for him.  He never spoke anything but German, and as a 'German' immigrant, was slapped on the back and sent up to saw down the gargantuan old growth trees on the slopes of Mt. Hood.  One of them untwisted unexpectedly as it fell.  It  kicked back and crushed him with one glancing blow.  He was thrown back onto the slope, heart stopped instantly, and his sojourn in the New World, beyond the grasp of the Manor where he had worked under the same feudal system that had chased my grandfather to the very docks of Finland (where he presented falsified papers, as my uncle had, that proclaimed him a free man and able to travel.)  My uncle and grandfather spoke fluent German.  You had to, if you wanted to escape the consequences that would follow you to America from the Old World.  Only in his dotage did my Grandfather switch back to Finnish, and the rock hard, laughing, no-bullshit German woman he'd married would scoff at him and correct his accent, which drove him into gales of loud Finnish invective, and was answered by some fancy German vituperation.  My grandmother took no shit, grew plants, made her own wine and moonshine, and expected the Second Coming of Christ with calm patience. The other person was my fathers mother, a woman who was not spoken of in our family.  My father would stay there alone, deep in the lowest part of the mausoleum, and I never knew what he thought or what he felt. Every Memorial day we would pick our bouquets from my grandmothers huge flower garden.  Other families would stop along the curb and ask if they could cut flowers, too, and my Grandmother would go with them with her deadly secateurs and clip them a neat bouquet, which she would wrap in wetted paper napkins so that the flowers would not wilt.__________________Now I play the part of my Grandmother for the Bikers' family here in Whatcom County.  It falls to the wife, taking care of the graves, and although my husbands' family were never very churchy, I am proud to carry the torch for my grandmother and tend the graves of my husbands family, who are my family.  I know what to bring, and when to go, and how to communicate with the caretaker.  The Bikers' family rest in a pioneer cemetery here in rural Whatcom County, and we tend their graves twice a year.  If there are other family members present they all look sideways at my Catholic ass as I say my prayer and then cross myself.  It's like a freaky secret coven to them, Methodists all.  I say ya know what?  My ass is edging the headstones, scrubbing out the graven letters and trimming up the evergreens from long, long ago that were planted to signify eternal remembrance.  You can just put up with my Papist shit , particularly since I don't see you on your knees using a pair of clippers or a bucket of soap and water and a scrub brush to clean off these headstones - and I don't even know these dead folks!  So do feel free to take the fuck off with your attitude._________________________________________For the most part, Memorial Day means massive illegal fireworks up here in Washington state.  It's pretty awesome, to tell you the truth.  The Biker and I can stand out on our front porch and watch huge, professional grade displays being shot off by all the local farmers, the rich folks who live up in the foothills, and the nuts who gather up a big old group of fools and go up onto the old logging stage of Dead Drug Dealer Mountain and fire off stupidly immense 'specials'.  Each one of those fuckers costs a brick at least and the really intricate displays will run way upwards of that.  Here's the deal:  you can go onto any Native American reserve and buy all the huge, dangerous, ridiculous, crazy, beautiful, amazing, magic, deadly fireworks your little heart desires - from roadside stands!  Right off the boat from Macau, nice and dry.  The thing is, by federal law, you the consumer are supposed to fire them off while you are On Reserve Land.Nobody fuckin' does this.Well, correction.  The NA families that buy fireworks by the case-lot, around 1:00 in the night, will just pile up their unsold stock in the middle of the road and light the shit off.*  It is UNREAL, folks.  Rockets skim across the ground and through the corn and foddergrass and then rock into the culminating display on the ground, in one dimension, which, shit, you wanna talk about crop circles, man?  It's unsafe, insane, and an absolute fucking awesome time.  It is trashy and absolutely the most fun you can have with most of your clothes on.  It is destructive and illegal and a total gas. The drunker you are the better it is.  Fireworks and booze are like peas and carrots.  The booze makes you take potentially lethal creative leaps of the imagination, plus fire, and the blood alcohol level of the onlookers brings them into full appreciation of your efforts.  You lose a jumbo bottle rocket and it goes skimming across the ground, some member of your drunk and enthusiastic audience will grab hold of the stick and fling it into the air as it blows sparks up their arm.  That is brotherhood, man. That is your fellow American helping you make Memorial Day awesome.____________________________________The longer you store fireworks, the more dangerous it is, because the chance that they will get damp increases with time, and damp fireworks are untrustworthy.  Some chemical interaction occurs, I am given to understand, in the rockets that use the most of the ingredient that makes the color green.  (Feel free to correct me.  I heard this from a drunk person on the Fourth of July years ago when we set a sofa on fire and taught our grandchildren to use guns. And I pulled a loose tooth out of my head with a pair of needle-nose pliers.  It was an Epic Fourth, but I must necessarily doubt the verity of the information I obtained that night due to massive beer and vodka consumption.) The Marietta branch of the local Lummi tribe are known for getting rid of unsold inventory in a stupendous display of not giving a rusty rats' ass, bigtime.  They live on a silt bar at the mouth of a river that lets into a saltwater bay.  They block off the road above and below their row of roadside stalls, pile all the leftovers on the dotted line, and fire the sapsucker off.  No need to worry about nearby structures catching fire, no nearby woods to sweat - it's all tidal wash and estuary.  The whole area becomes a supernova, one that you can see from miles around as it glitters on the waters of the bay and swarms through the reeds and tule and cottonwood. The tribal police are so busy in other areas that even though they know that Marietta is blocking traffic and melting a hole in the tarmac, other bands in more remote parts of the area are setting bonfires using beach logs, gasoline and industrial fans.  When you are confronted with several columns of flame reaching up into the sky high enough to heat up the International Space station, you head toward the most obvious threat.  And frankly, this is something that everyone expects. It's almost tradition.  The Red River Lummis fire off huge bonfires on the beach full of driftwood and gasoline, and the Marietta Lummis create massive galaxies of destruction in the tidal surge swamps.  Five miles further inland, the Ferndale Lummis are lighting off professional grade displays from the top of the local grocery store, and all the Bostons (whitey) who have already laid in their supply and smuggled it off the rez are going nuts as well.There is no way the police or the fire department can keep up with it.  They concentrate on the timberlands and the crops.  If someone is lighting off WWIII in a cul-de-sac in the middle of town, they'll hit that.Off the rez, this havoc is being wreaked by people my age, old enough to know better.  They do.  They just don't care.  They have the money to buy the bigtime rockets, and they do.  They go up into the hills, find a timber stage, set up camp, burn some hot dogs, kill some beers, and then fire off professional grade fireworks until they get too drunk to operate a lighter.We here at Rancho FirstNations don't spend a dime.  Everyone in town has paid for our entertainment.  We stand on the porch and the neighbors provide us with a display that you won't get from a team of pros.No, that team of pros will be here come rodeo season, and come the Fourth of July we'll have a  nice, city-sponsored display too.  And it's usually a doozy.  One of the things that brought us to decide to live in this town was attending it's Fourth of July Celebration, with baseball games, a horse show (I dunno, dressage display?  Like a dog show but with people riding horses.  I'm not a horse person.) kids running around with sparklers and the rodeo grandstand filled with people who cheered and blew airhorns and sang The National Anthem and This Land Is Your Land and cheered.Come Monday, which is Official Memorial Day, we'll go take care of our dead, then lay in some beers, have some friends over, barbecue some animal pieces and eat potato salad.  Come the evening, the whole sky will be lit up for hours, and we'll sit around our fire pit and just hang out and enjoy the show. You are invited."},

Someone you cannot imagine anyone associating with, much less the wonderful person you love?For ten years now my husband has had a friend named George.George, according to George, knows Tom Robbins, the author of 'Still Life With Woodpecker', 'Another Roadside Attraction', etc. Grew up with him. Blood brothers.Whenever Tom's in town he visits George secretly, at night, and is gone with the dawns first light, because he doesn't want to cause a lot of media hoopla.According to him, Tom Robbins weighs 500 lbs and is probably going to die of a heart attack.According to George, he grew up with the Kneivels...Evel and son Robbie.Rode motorcycles with them. Blood brothers, in fact.When Robbie came to jump some cars here in Deming a couple of years ago, ol' George says he went up there and tried to (play the 'known him all my life' card) get in to see him, but Robbie Kneivel said 'Never heard of the guy' right to his face.George says this is proof that Robbie Kneivel has gone Hollywood.His daughter has recurring spells of hysterical blindness caused by his ex-wife's infidelity. According to George.And yet, illogically, and according to George, he (profoundly and continuously stoned every waking moment ever since I've known him) and his ex-wife (300 lbs, depressed and raising two teenage girls alone and on Welfare) were swingers when we first knew them (and they were unable to pay rent or buy groceries, and had their Christmas turned in to a charity media event by a local radio station; probably broke because of all the  dues they were paying to all these private, exclusive swingers clubs  kaffkaffBULLSHITkaff) screwing celebrities and government officials and people you wouldn't even believe, man.By the way, this means that if you swing, and you live in the Seattle-Everett-Bellingham area, you probably have fucked either George or his ex-wife, according to George.I hope you were wearing a condom.George is incapable of paying a bill or keeping a running car.But according to George, he came into a huge inheritance two years ago. In the middle of a raging statewide housing market, George claims he lost it all investing in real estate.George, according to George, has several original M. C. Escher lithographs and several Aubrey Beardsley prints in a safe deposit box. And a rare match edition ( signed by all twelve apostles with engraved meteoric silver and unicorn horn inlay or some shit like that) rifle.  So in case of an emergency, he can just liquidate those for big money.  Uh...hmm.Seven years ago, George claimed that doctors had given him less than year to live.He begged my husband to kill him. My husband refused. George said he understood.George then had a premonition.He would die that coming April 24th.In June, after everyone (including George) had forgotten this dire prediction, I popped up and pointed out that George was 1. Well past his expiration date and 2. Still miraculously undeceased.This was widely regarded as having been in poor taste on my part.George has been dying of a mysterious ailment for the past sixteen years, according to George. As proof, occasionally George will suddenly remember he's supposed to be dying, freeze, contort his face, gak a couple of times and keel over.No.I am NOT KIDDING.He has run up several hundred thousand dollars trying to get this mystery ailment diagnosed.He cannot pay these bills. Not even Bill Gates could pay these bills.Not even Tom Robbins.George, as you might have guessed, is captain of the good ship Munchausen.His latest pile landed in my ear about an hour ago. (I wrote this yesterday. Now it's today.)\"Uhhh...I have a question...You probably know what I'm talking about when I mention... Aleister Crowley...? Maria Blavatsky....?\" is how the conversation started.\"Ah\", I thought, \"George found some Vicodin. \"According to George, he had come into the possession of a hand written, original manuscript of the book of Dzyan. He alluded to its having been found in mysterious circumstances, and that some poor guy died right on the spot, probably suicide, man, where it had been found, just from holding it, and that there were lots of other really sick, weird stuff found all around him.  This was in a cave where George was being held captive because George. That the manuscript, which he had, was probably worth a lot of fuckin' money to someone.\"Ah\", I thought, \"George needs money for Vicodin. \"Now, George has been in jail for the past couple of months. We all know this.  It is a fact.According to George, he has been in Venezuela.Despite his former outstanding warrants, he was allowed to leave the country. Because he's George.  And  according to George, one of his 'big dope growing buddies from Wenatchee' took him.Out of the country.To Venezuela.Where he found this hand written manuscript of the book of Dzyan. In a dead guys hand.In a cave.Oh!  And there were infants' skulls lying around in the cave too.\"...And you know what that means...\" Said George knowingly.George then produced an old, mimeographed transcript of a Theosophy lecture.He handed it to me. I looked at it.   I looked at him.\"Randy's in the garage,\" I sighed.  I knew what would happen next.Yes. I AM a pitiless bitch. But that's aside the point. George says he can't afford child support, he can't afford rent, but he can ALWAYS afford every illegal narcotic known to pharmacy science and cram it by the metric shitload into his head.  It's bullshit.He isn't that far gone.  He knows.  And he know's he's playing the 'be so pitiful and embarrassing that people will do anything to get you out of their space' card.  And he played it to the tune of several hundred dollars, by the time he left the garage.Randy and I have since had a talk about George, and about Munchausens Disorder, and about everyone else we know who's being played similarly by George.  About Georges' kids and his ex wife, living on Welfare, and George living in a nice apartment and spending all his money on drugs.   See, here's the kicker:   George is managing to hold down a full time job with benefits.  For eight hours a day, George manages to maintain flawlessly and operate equipment in a mill that makes - no shit - industrial sized sawblades for cutting stone and large metal solids.  This he does, and has buddy-buddied up the owner so well that he doesn't even get his wages garnished, which should rightfully be the case with dependent children.  But nope.  George has this manipulation thing down.  It's why he hasn't talked to me since his 'Book of Dzyan' episode.Yup. Next time he goes to visit the infant sacrificing Theosophists and their mimeograph machine in Venezuela, I hope he stays."},
{"title": "A Walk Down Memory Lane", "date": "Sunday, May 23, 2021", "text": "I just found my old blog here: https://www.blogger.com/profile/13387748372500478809And if I do say so myself, and I do, parts of it are worth a read.  In fact, I'll throw a few up here.  This is one of my favorites.SECOND COUSIN LEOTAI have no idea if Bill T was really related to us. What I remember is that he was supposed to have been my grandmothers' second cousin, so that's how we referred to him and his wife.He was a nice old guy. He used to come over to our house quite a bit, his wife in tow, and play cribbage with my mom and her friends until the wee hours. Every hour or so he'd slip off outside to the trunk of his car where he had a bottle of Canadian Mist stashed and sip on that while he stood in the driveway and admired the stars.His wife's name was Leota.She was 5000 years old, had eight hairs left, weighed maybe 80 pounds and stood four feet tall.Smoked constantly. Sometimes she'd have a cigarette going in each hand and one in the ashtray. We would find more of them smoldering away all over the house, long black foul things melting a line in the countertop or the arm of a chair, lying on the wool carpet in the middle of a glowing patch of nap.Little Leota wasn't much for conversation. The complete lack of teeth was a barrier, as was the advanced senile dementia. Being perpetually pickled in vodka didn't help.You have to stop and consider that for a moment. I can guarantee you she wasn't driving down to the liquor store even before the Altzheimers' set in because she couldn't drive and wouldn't have been able to see through the windsheild anyway. Where was she getting the stuff?Every morning, Bill would get her up, run her through the tub, get her dressed,shovel some Malt-O-Meal down her (very occasionally Maypo...she refused to eat anything else) and then set her in a chair out on the porch with her fifth of vodka and let her wave at the cars going by.This was how a lot of poor, older people coped with a loved one's dementia, and still do.She was loved. She was cared for. And as far as I could see she didn't have a bad life at all. What the fuck, you know?__________________________Now Bill and my mom would get playing Crib and nothing could stop them. They played like demons. My dad and I weren't big card players, and we would have had to have been real hot shots to keep up with them anyway, so dad napped on the couch and I hung out in my room listening to records.Dad could fall asleep anywhere, anytime. And when he did, more often than than not he would have really interesting dreams. I grew up with it so I didn't notice so much but it could really freak a visitor out. \"Gahno farah muld gahyub! Call Jim!\" he'd shout, with his arms waving around randomly. If it was coming from the couch, you ignored it.Leota would watch the card playing and smoke. Occasionally she'd giggle. No reason, just joie d' vivre. Other times she'd come out with a brief statement and end it by saying Ha!\"You horse you, get that ol' cat! Fan room the store. Ha!\"Evenings at my house could be interesting.The only thing she ever contributed regularly to the conversation was this kind of a verbal tic. She'd WUP.Just out of the blue. No reason. She'd just be sitting there smoking quietly and suddenly out would pop 'WUP!'Some days, you'd only hear one every two or three minutes. Other days she'd be wuppin' all over the place.Sometimes she'd come up missing during the summer, when we kept the doors open. But all you had to do was be very quiet for a few minutes, and then off in the distance you'd hear 'Wup!' and you'd follow that. My parents were rather impressed when I showed them this discovery. You'd find her over in my Grandma's yard, looking over the fence at the neibors having a barbecue, take her by the hand, everyone would wave 'bye', and home you went, wuppin' all the way.One night I was lying on my bed reading and listening to the intermittent 'Wups' coming from the kitchen when I was struck by a bolt of inspiration so hard it hurt my brain. Inspirations like these came frequently the year I was thirteen.I crept down the hall into the entryway, where I was hidden from the view of anyone in the kitchen, except Leota.Leota went 'Wup!'I went 'Wup!\"Then she said 'Wup!\"I answered 'Wup!\"And she replied 'Wup!\"Everyone playing cards at the kitchen table was totally oblivious. Leota was having fun. I was having fun too when dad caught me.He thought it was hysterical. I mean, yeah, he sent me to my room, but he was laughing.An hour later I happen to glance up towards the living room and there's dad on the couch, peeking over the easy chair towards the kitchen.'Wup!\" said my dad.The ensuing silence was so thick you could cut it!\"Wup!\" came from the kitchen.\"Niilo! Now stop that! That's not funny!\" yelled my mom.Man, I fell OFF THE BED. I laughed so hard I think it stunted my growth.________________________________________________________You couldn't help but like Leota. She was in a happy, simple place, like a (really really wrinkly) baby (who smoked) enjoying a sunbeam.Now, ninety-nine times out of a hundred Leota was happy to watch the card players; but sometimes she wanted a change of scene. However, because she had a form of Tourettes' that caused her to chirp \"WUP!' at regular intervals like a smoke alarm with a failing battery, she was fairly easy to ride herd on.The thing was, you had to be paying attention. She would go into closed rooms and stand quietly in the dark, nothing evident but the ember on her smoke and you'd never know she was there until you happened to hear 'wup!' float out from behind the door.Once in the bathroom I heard a cheery 'wup!' coming from the cabinet right next to where I was sitting and about died of a heart attack. We found her in the basement standing under the metal laundry chute, wupping away, entertained by the echo.This is what happened the very last time she visited:One November afternoon, everyone was sitting around the kitchen table, my mom and all the other card sharks, partying it up loud and happy, knocking back the 7 and 7's. As usual I was avoiding all this by hiding in my room.My mom came knocking on my door. \"Leota's gone. Is she in here?\"Nope.Since it was cold, and I was the kid, I got sent outside to look for her while everyone else staggered around the house hooting 'LeOOOOTaaaa....'Me, I glanced around close by, listened for her, didn't hear her, and promptly put all thought of her completely out of my mind. Evidently everyone else did too, because when I returned they were all pretty surprised to see me. \"Where'd you go?\" asked Mom.I needed to hit the Ritz. The half bath was for the card players, so I went down the hall to the master bathroom.Knocked on the door. Nobody answered. I opened the door.I found Leota.My moms beautiful pink bathroom with the pink fixtures and the pink towels and pink curtains, yeah. Not any more.Leota had been fingerpainting.She had decorated the entire wall, from the floor up as high as she could reach, with shit.She had painted the entire side of the bathtub with shit.She had painted the entire inside of the bathtub with shit.And the faces of all the cabinets.And the mirror, the counter, the sink, and the floor.Everything except the toilet, oddly enough.The entire bathroom was covered in shit. And so was she.She had a smoke going. She smiled at me toothlessly from where she sat on the bathmat. 'Wup!' she said.Complete disaster. Yelling, buckets, throwing things out the bathroom window onto the lawn, people running in and out of the house brandishing Pine-Sol, playing cards on the floor, forget it. Total chaos.I was gone when it happened, but I understand Leota got her very first shower that day at our house and didn't care for it much. She went home in a bathrobe. She got to keep it.I was outside at the time. My parents put me outside. They were pissed off because I wasn't helping. I wasn't helping because I could not stop laughing and I couldn't walk.

{"title": "Hot Stuff Baby You Want It, Honey!", "date": "Wednesday, May 19, 2021", "text": "I have a bizarre physiology in that my system quickly becomes used to any given substance and develops a tolerance to it.  I am also able to digest compounds, particularly capsaicins, fully, so that whatever stupid hot stuff I've eaten doesn't 'take it's revenge on the way out.' Back when I was eight years old my father made friends with a dude from the Bandidos MC whose road name was Paco.  Paco was super cool, an older dude with a wife and a family and grandkids.  He rode a huge fuckin' Harley and flew his colors all the time.  The 'didos were known for turning it around - a leather bore your top and bottom rocker with your club mascot and motto, if any, in the middle.  Other 1%'ers would cover up their colors with Levi's jackets with the arms cut off, which made it into a denim  vest called a 'cutoff'.  The Bandidos, at least in Multnomah and Clackamas, never, never rode under cuts.  Their way of telling all the other clubs how badass they were was to get their old lady to weave (on a frame and nail loom; remember those, old people?) a vest with a personalized version of the official Bandidos insignia and the riders road name.  That was REPPING. You never rode under a cut. They were Bad Mother.... (Shut your mouth! Well I'm talkin' bout Shaft! Then we can dig it!)Anyway, so much for biker culture.  At the time I was cooking all my own food because my mothers cooking was...less than optimum.  If I wanted to see anything on my dinner plate that wasn't boiled or had gone through a pressure cooker, then I had to make it, and I used to watch Graham Kerr and copy the recipes and make my own dinners.  One of the things I loved was Spaghetti Diavolo.  Only my Diavolo was straight from the Seventh Circle of Hell; Violence - and I violently used that hot chili spice, man.  It made ol' Paco sweat and wipe his face and my father cough and sweat. Ha.Around that same time Mezzetta came out with pickled jalapeno peppers, and Paco had gotten my dad addicted to them, because he'd bring a jar to work and pass them out.  All the white boys freaked, but my dad was (all flaws aside) cast fuckin' meteoric iron, and nothing brought him down.  He developed a taste for them, and we started having a jar of them on the table for dinner every meal.  My dad challenged me to eat one, thinking that I would gag and cry or something - but I didn't.  Sure, it burned, but it burned good, and it had that vinegar bite that killed the taste of my moms cooking.  I became addicted too.Over the years I challenged myself to eat hotter and hotter peppers, and I worked my way up to Scotch Bonnets, raw.  Like an apple. 'Sweet Old Man' peppers - like an apple.  People told me I was going to give myself an ulcer, but seriously?  All the cultures in the world that include raging  hot peppers in their everyday cuisine who aren't suffering from bleeding ulcers kind of convinced me that I wasn't doing anything dangerous - just delicious.By the time I was in my fifties I was eating La Yucatecan green sauce like it was water, on everything.And one of my friends said 'You know, you ought to go into competitive chili eating.\"This appealed to me.Peppers! Being a chick!  Delicious peppers!  Showing off! Winning money!  (Or more usually beer, or a tavern jacket, or some lottery tickets)?  Yeah, I was thinking about it.  I started buying Scotch Bonnets and eating them raw, and grinding up Japonaises and coating chicken nuggets with the dust and working my way up, man.  My husband was afraid to eat leftovers.  My daughter frankly cried.  And so between these two white folks, I decided not to accidentally poison my family and gave it up.Yes, I was almost a competitive hot pepper eater.Could I still work my way back up?  Hell yes I could.  But I'm not going to because - there really isn't any real return for your effort, and some of those exotic hot chilis cost money, honey.So I am going to pass on my secrets of hot chili eating to those of you who have been considering entering the arena:1. Mayonnaise.  Mayonnaise emulsifies oil and water.  It ties itself to the hot capsaisin and renders it into a form that can be washed away by water.  One sip of milk and you're out of a competition.  Water?  Not a problem.  Piece of bread?  Tortilla?  Home free.2. Cortisone.  If you have an inflammatory issue and you take any corticosteroid, it cuts the reaction of your body to capsaisin by about 2/3.  A bird pepper will give you a minor tingle and a wink if you have corticosteroids on board. No shit.3. Bananas.  If you have one of those stomachs that refuse to listen to reason, eat a few bananas before the ordeal.  That hot stuff will just get lost in the shuffle.Now that you have my secret hot pepper eating secrets, go forth.  Compete.  Rise to greatness. Get that tavern jacket!  Spend a shitpile of cash!  Travel to Thailand and compete against North Dakotans, huge Teutons and sly Scotsmen, eager to prove their DNA against native consumers!  Eat those peppers!  Go for the gold!!!!!"},
{"title": "That Shirt", "date": "Tuesday, May 18, 2021", "text": "When I was in sixth grade, Masterpiece theater was running The Six Wives of Henry The Eighth, and I was ALL IN.  My mother, and even my father.  Aleister Cooke introduced the episodes sitting in an armchair before an open fire, in a library full of books, and then for an hour on public television you were in a scandalous, irreverent, wonderful world of exquisite lace collars and extravagant codpieces, gems,  satin, silk and furs, court intrigue, corruption, base influence and true, if misguided, piety.Nobody had ever seen anything like this, not where I lived.  And everyone was watching it.  Everybody!  In my neighborhood of legal secretaries, truck drivers, bartenders, store clerks, accountants and housewives, it was on every tongue, the way Upstairs, Downstairs would be, and Brideshead Revisited, and Downton Abbey would be.  My father, a foreman splicer at the dockyards, would manage to stay awake through an episode, and react to the things going on as the episode played.Me, I was IN.  I found, and don't ask me where, a beautiful shirt.  It was tailored and had long tails.  It buttoned up the front, had a tall, long collar and long, pointed cuffs.  The sleeves were gathered hard at the shoulders, leg o' mutton, and ran all the way down in tiny, tiny pleats to the long cuffs.  It was a muted sunset color, with lengthwise stripes, and I practically lived in it.It made me feel like a young courtier, a princess pretending to be a prince, a duchess pretending to be a duke.  It fit me perfectly.  I was a bounteous young thing at 11 years old.  I would braid my hair wet the night before, and then unbraid it the next morning and pull it back into a loose, romantic ponytail with the temples curled, and hit school like...I dunno. The Scarlet Pimpernel?  Something androgenous.Because I had a reputation as a reader and an artist, I was allowed to walk to the big library in  downtown Milwaukie and use the adult readers section. (This was an honor that I'd won at the age of six, when the librarian took a look at what I'd been checking out and upped my age and printed out my card with a wink.)  And like a dork, instead of using that time to get high and hang out under the railroad tracks with homeless junkies, I did honestly walk all the way from Seth Llewelling Elementary School to the main library in downtown (as it was ) Milwaukie and luxuriate in ALL THE REFERENCE and THE ADULT COLLECTION.One day I was there looking up a list of words in the Big Dictionary that was set on a sturdy oak podium near the main checkout desk. When I say Big Dictionary, I mean a book that you had to have a librarian help you open, and then had to use cotton gloves to turn the pages and a weighted bar to hold the pages in place so you didn't accidentally cause any creases when you closed the book.So there I was, in my favorite shirt, with my favorite hairdo, looking at the Truly Immense Dictionaryin a studious manner, and someone took my picture.  I looked up, and it was a young man with an unnecessarily large and complex camera, and I thought to myself \"Huh.\" and let that go.Until I turned up in the Milwaukie Journal.  Our little towns newspaper.Looking fuckin' STUNNING.Out of all the pictures ever taken of me, that photo is the one that pretty much captures  me.  I wore that shirt until it refused to button over the tits anymore.  It was wore OUT.  And I  miss it. It was just my color, just my style, set off the shape of my face and made me look like an androgynous, sexy young courtier who got up to no good at night and conveyed secret messages and got up to Hijinks.One of the things I am surprisingly good at is using a sewing machine.  One of these days I might go online and find a pattern and make myself a grown up version of that shirt.  It made me feel heroic and adventurous.  And what more can you ask from a piece of clothing?(My love to The Elf) As soon as I saw the Iris Germanica putting out spathes I knew we were in for a hailstorm, and Nature did not disappoint.  It's hitting the window now like someone throwing handfulls of gravel at my house from close range.  Thankfully the irises were not opened (a couple of pseudacorus, nothing rare) but of course the peonies are out there confused as hell with the way the weather is changing from hour to hour.  Do I stay open? Do I stay closed?  WTF?  (My peonies have gutter mouths, I know, it's embarrassing.)I carefully edited out all the development that's been taking place next to my house.  There is an elementary/Jr. Hi (Oh hoo-RAY) going up right behind my house, blocking my view of the Canadian Cascades once and for all.  I used to be able to see them out of my kitchen window.  Next year I'll be looking out at a big building filled with zitty kids.  And those zitty kids will be all up in my grille and I am seriously considering cyclone fencing now.The Biker went on his first job interview today, and since it was arranged by his current place of employment (that is closing it's doors) I hope it gives him an 'in'.  If he can't work he'll spiral out into a depression, and I'll spiral out into husbandicidal tendencies if I have to put up with him sitting around my house unemployed, watching car crash videos.  I, on the other hand, had to stop waking up to puppy and  kitten videos. I got into the habit this last winter because puppies and kittens are not bleak and are frequently cute and funny.  Now I've discovered  that puppies and kittens can get real old. REAL OLD.  I know that after awhile I'll be back down with the puppies and kittens, but for now, the Garden awaits.And what is it with all the bearded dragons lately? How is that a fun pet?  And people buy clothes for them!  And...it's a fucking lizard!  I do not understand this.  Just like I don't understand the 'Goats as a house pet' trend.  Pigs...I can see a piggy as an outdoor pet.  But on my furniture? NO. Similarly super miniature horses.  Just...why? Why is that a thing? Who said 'You know what we need?  A super miniature horse the size of a dog clambering all over our stuff and fucking it up with it's hooves and gnawing on our furniture.  That sounds like a fun pet. IN AN APARTMENT.'  And there is nothing sadder than seeing a monkey in a diaper trapped in a suburban home with a woman who speaks to it in a high baby voice.  GAAH.So in the time it's taken me to type this, the hail has stopped, the skies have cleared, there is sunshine, no precip of any kind, and yeah.  I can't really do anything outside because all I have left is lifting, dividing and planting, and that's not good in wet, heavy clay.  It is bad and no fun.At least it's not snowing."},

So yeah, Monday. Monday I'll be touching up the paint._______________________________________The tenor of my entries has been homeowner based ever since we paid off the joint, and I know I haven't been the funny monkey that people have come to know and be appalled by, but owning, really OWNING property is...it changes your outlook.  After having rented my whole adult life, suddenly I OWN this chunk of ant-chewed wood and insufficient insulation.  It's oddly like when I was a little kid and I had Barbies.  I used to take their clothes and alter them, add stuff, subtract stuff, restyle...right? I know, me?  Using a sewing machine?  Playing with Barbies?  But I did, and I was nuts about them because there were so many patterns for Barbie clothes (put out by Butterick, as I recall) and I used to use old  Goodwill-thrift shop clothes for yard goods.  My Barbies looked like the first night of a new season of RuPauls Drag Race.  They had crazy Carnaby street fashions and wild, extreme minis and microminis,  Emma Peel high fashion togs and accessories, just everything I could get my hands on for...geeze, I don't recall the patterns being any more than .69 cents.This is not to say that my house looks like a giant, ant-chewed drag queen.  That's not what I mean at all. Just that I own the fucker and I'm doing things to prink it up so that it's an asset to our little town, right by the 'Welcome To Sumas' sign.  I really take pride in this.  ___________________________Today as we were sitting here enjoying multiple tasty beverages and watching videos of cute pets doing cute things, who should come in peeking around the sofa but Chica!We leave the house open to let the air blow through during nice weather.  I get the occasional swallow and hummingbird, but this is the first time I've ever had a Staffie come in, grinning like a clown, to say howdy.  Neighborhood Crackhead was outside calling for her, and the Biker and I were cracking up, and finally I got a hold of her harness and carried her outside to her Dad.  Staggering.  That dog is a CHONK.  Then we shut the joint up for a few hours.Depressed Black Kitty often lets herself travel through my house, just passin' through.  Says 'Mewoo?' as she walks from the kitchen to the front room and out the front door.  Just an informal visit.  I've had starlings fly in and land on my head while I was washing dishes, and swallows will fly through during midsummer, back and forth, just playing.  Hummingbirds will zip through, stop in front of my face to cuss me out, and then continue on.  Yesterday I had a newly fledged crow (certainly a son or daughter of Alice and Ralph) court me with 'feed me' calls until I got it a hamburger bun.  I taught it my 'treats' whistle and made sure that lil' bird saw my face in association with treats, and learned to associate a certain whistle I've made up specifically to signal 'Crow Treats!'  and a certain face (mine, duh) with those treats.  I waited in sight quietly until lil' bird came and took a few bites, and repeated my 'food lady' whistle, and made sure the bird saw me.Think what you will. That crow and I communicated.  It did the same thing with me - 'asked' for food, made sure that I saw its body from all sides, and then retreated to wait.  It was an extremely rudimentary exchange, but a question was asked of a known source of food, (me) and the KSoF identified herself and provided food in answer to the request.  I'm trying to replicate the studies that are being done in the Seattle Arboretum with wild crows - assessing their powers of sonic, visual and routine memory. There's a link out there, go hit it.  It's incredibly interesting.There are similar experiments being done with the New Zealand Kea.  It's an alpine parrot (?) that is so deviously clever that we'd probably never know if they took over the reins of global government.  I kind of hope they do.______________________This time of year the queens are hatching.  Hornets, Wasps and Bumblebees, kids.  They pupate in the soil until it reaches a certain warm temperature for a few days in succession, then shed their shiny brown shells and emerge from the earth fat, groggy, lost and hungry.  Any 'stingy' insect you see here around May is a queen, and is looking for carbohydrates so that it can get laid and begin building a nest for it's eggs.  I am prejudiced in favor of bumbles and honeybees.  Let a wasp or a hornet get in here? Motherfucker dies.  I have enough problems in my life without tiny flying carnivores."},

Serious as shit - it's so if someone died in the middle of the winter, they could get the body out of the house even if there were deep snowdrifts (and yes, they do get that deep here.)  Inside there in the attic is a lightning stick hanging from one of the rafters - that's a branch taken from a tree that was struck by lightning and nailed to the rafters of a house to keep future lightning strikes away, assumedly because it's already been that sticks' turn.  And the stick?  Was from a tree that stood at the North corner of our property and was hit by lightning and fell on the house and just caused all kinds of shit and kerfuffle; but that was in 1940 -  so whatever.You'll probably never see another one of these.  The tree is a Camperdown Elm that I got as a seedling from a nearby property.  Now usually Camperdowns are grafted onto a scion of regular elm and let to cascade, because a Camperdown is a rare mutation of elm that has no gene for making a trunk - just a canopy.  I put eyebolts into the main branches as they grew and drew them upwards with turnbuckles until I had the form I wanted.  It was a bitch and it took fifteen years, but I have this lovely tree and it's amazing, zigzag structure, and it's an ornament all year round.The stuff in front are tigerlilies that have yet to reach full height and blossom.  I think they look nice here just as a plant form.Japanese Maples 'Golden Moon' and...red...maple thing.  An upright of cotynus 'Velvet Cloak' is trying to steal the spotlight left.Things are happening fast out there!  Every day I've got something new waiting for me!  So while the garden is puttin' right along and doing fine, I'm painting my bathroom blue.  Because it was time.  There comes a time when that bathroom has to be painted blue, folks.  I'm doing it.  I'm doing it for AMERICA."},
{"title": "The May Wait", "date": "Thursday, May 13, 2021", "text": "Everything is up and leafing out.  Now we are into the May Wait out in the garden, when all the plants are pulling at the ground like hungry kittens, trying to make flowers to tempt the emerging native pollinators.  Bumbles, Orchard Masons, various flies and of course honeybees; although those are already on the job thanks to the raspberry and blueberry farmers.You might not realize it, but shitty bastards like hornets and wasps also play their part in pollinating.  So do field mice, who will clamber around on your plants at night looking for sleepy aphids and other insects to eat. So do cats, who rustle around in the garden and help plants sprinkle pollen into the breeze.  In fact, so do I, wandering around among the flowers pulling weeds.  I am a native pollinator!  And a Native American! I know, right?Honeybee doin' it's honey thing.  Rock on, lil' bee.I know that the media has been pushing this 'death of the pollinators' thing for years now.  Kids, I haven't seen it.   Yes, I've seen a shortage of apis mellifera, the common honeybee, and that's as much due to poor husbandry and lousy sanitation as it is mites and disease.  One follows the other. RANT FOLLOWS.Skeps are transported by the DOUBLE TRAILER LOAD, by semis, twenty skeps high, and dropped off at fields, and the farmhands take them in stacks of five and put those here and there amid the fields. That's status quo.  It didn't used to be that way.  People used to realize that you needed to be very clean and particular when it came to honeybees. Honeybee husbandry changed around the late Seventies. Now it has a 'throwaway' paradigm going.  They're a commodity, and a valuable one.  You don't just let them fly away and create wild nests, no.  You ship in a bee that's adapted to a Mediterranean climate, essentially a one-season creature in this latitude, and voila, another cash crop created where none existed 50 years before. My uncle was a beekeeper, and he would get called out to take down wild nests, which he would transfer to surgically clean skeps.  All insects are susceptible to filthy conditions, molds, fungi and mites.  His outfit was a lot like a cheesemaking operation - very, very clean, stainless steel equipment, live steam and iodine used to keep the product safe - and the hives and frames were treated similarly.  You never saw a skep with black fungus crawling up the sides like you do now - the farmer would throw that into the fire!  You never saw mass transport of skeps like you do now - the producer knew that in those concentrations a disease would move like wildfire through the entire load, as it travelled 50, 100, or more miles to it's destination.  And handlers had to clean their beekeepers outfits with an iodine solution, particularly their gloves.Out in my garden right now I have a riot of happy pollinators doing their thing. Hummingbirds, sphinx moths - hell, moths of all sorts - birds, bats...you know the saying 'Nature abhors a vacuum'?  Nature is filling that vacuum out here with such enthusiasm that I have to mow the yard with my pantlegs tucked into my socks like a dork because the ground wasps get pissed off.  Bumblebees will just dive and smack into you.  Chubby bumblebee just pollinating your world for all it's worth!Queen hornets, which are waking up right about now, will just follow you around by the scent of your exhale and menace you and land on you and generally act like assholes and sting you for no reason.  Or even take a bite out of you with their freakin' jaws if you've cracked a heavy, salty sweat.  Yes.  They do that.  They think you're dead, you see.  That's what hornets do - clean up carrion and pollinate things.  If you smell like carrion, well...shit gonna happen.We are not at the brink of disaster.  We are being taken for idiots by Big Agriculture.  I see this every year.  I've had people who work with bees on an artisanal level tell me the same thing that I've just said. It's not so much a problem of disease as it is husbandry and stock.Something to bear in mind:  The honeybee is not native to America.  Nope. It was brought here from Europe. (Fuck you, Europe.) They went feral and adapted.  Before that, it was just native pollinators, and if ya don't believe me, read this:  https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-many-species-native-bees-are-united-states?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_If ya don't believe me, that's SCIENCE up there in that link.  We're gonna make it."},

Baker and just gather them off the roadside.  Purdy kewl!A snapdragon that for some odd reason decided to bloom out of season.  I'll take it!  It's a sport of 'Black Prince' that's been jumping around my garden for years, after I stole the seeds out of a public planting in Everson.  That's how I roll.  Arrrrr.  Behind it is rosa 'Coffee Bean', and beyond that the black leaves of 'Palace Purple' heuchera, a few little yellow poppies, and some leaves of daylilly.  OO, and a star magnolia that's all out of stars for this year, and somebodies' house, and the brown square that is the back of our 'Welcome to Sumas!' sign.I'll have to limit y'all here.  It's a lot of awesome to take in all at one go."},
{"title": "Freakin' Neighbors Being All Friendly And Shit", "date": "Sunday, May 9, 2021", "text": "Yesterday it was everybody, young, old, and canine, and they were all on my sidewalk wanting to chat, and letting themselves into my garden and being friendly and casual and nice.  Neighborhood Crackhead, his dog Chica and I just hung out on the grass for awhile that afternoon and listened to music together and played with the dog, and that was nice.  We're friends now.  Casual and nice.The four little (horsemen of the apocalypse) boys who must know about every plant in sight were back and forth all day long chatting about what, I have very little idea, because they start sentences in the middle of a thought and aren't real clear on things, and talk about video games a lot.  I nod and smile.  And shoo the littlest guy out of my yard multiple times a day.The kid next door had his girlfriend over.  You can tell because his dog gets all bent out of shape and barks nonstop until they're...done...and she leaves, slick as hell, ten minutes before Dad gets home.  He has that dog on a leash and out the door he goes, nice, responsible older brother, as dad loads in stuff from his car, and the Biker and I just look at each other and snerk a bit.  Kid's got it down to a science.  That, and when someone lives literally five feet away from you, you get to learn their comings and goings, as it were.Pet Teenager came over and insisted on helping me weed.  She does a good job and she's a nice, funny kid, and we did some weeding.  And then she began to decompensate.Pet Teenager has bipolar disorder.  As the minutes passed, she slid into a manic episode.Now I've had a few of them.  Hell, my daughter spends half her life that way.  So I didn't get too alarmed when she told me; I'd already guessed. And since she's a happy hyper, she said some incredibly goofy stuff that had us laughing so hard we were lying on the grass in hysterics.   Finally she got to a point where she needed to go home, so I gently kept her on track, and she made it home OK.  I gotta say, she weeded the holy hell out of my garden.  It looks downright professional out there._____________________________Same thing happened today.  It was Mothers' Day here, and I hung out and we barbecued some hamburgers and it was nice. Everyone was out walking around, riding bikes, razor scooters, skateboards; me, I kind of sidled around the yard and avoided contact, because sometimes you just want to hang out and not chat.It occurred to me then that I have friends in town.I was really, really careful to stay on distant but friendly terms with people for years, because this is a small place.  But time and carelessness on my part has lead to me knowing peoples' names and stuff, and now here I am, barely civilized, only marginally social, and I have friends.  Just casual neighborhood friends.Shit, my parents didn't even have friends in our neighborhood.  My grandmother lived right next door, there were uncles and cousins living nearby, and those were the people we hung out with mostly; that and a few friends from the shipyards where my dad worked who were bikers.  One was a Bandito and the other guy was a lone wolf who rode with the Hells Angels - both of them super good guys and really nice to me.  But my parents never did any socializing close to home, and given the fact that we were the weird family on the street, that was probably for the best. (They were bickerers, and it was constant; and sometimes the volume was such that as soon as I turned onto our street I could hear them.  Clearly.  And they used high, mocking tones of voice and exaggerated sarcasm that really made the whole sideshow complete, man.)  Some days I'd just ride on past and go hit one of my friends houses and call home to ask if I could stay for dinner.  Thank God we had a very nice house and yard.  I mean THANK GOD for that.  You could get away with a lot of shit as long as you kept your property up.  We had a neighbor who was in the National Guard, and when he got going, us kids would stop and just stare at his house.  The man was a sergeant who trained the new recruits and boy, he kept the goddamn troops in line, man.  His wife and three daughters were scared to death of this asshole - but he kept his yard up.  Gorgeously landscaped.  Pass!Not so with one of the guys who lived a couple of houses away.  Didn't mow his yard, let the place get crappy looking, had a broken down car parked at the curb - dude had the police at his house about twice a month.  And it was just yelling and stuff, no gunfire or anything, but he let the place go to hell and he was judged by all the middle managers and bank tellers and school teachers and legal secretaries in our 'hood for that. Go ahead and scream obscenities at the top of your lungs, fine, but MOW YOUR DAMN LAWN YOU ANIMAL.It's interesting.  I remember when I was a kid you'd ride your bike around and it was not at all uncommon to hear people arguing.  The last time I heard someone yelling here, it was our freaky neighbors who were animal hoarders and were evicted and the house had to be burned down because it was a biohazard.  The one sister used to get pissed off at the pear tree in their back yard around 11:00 at night and scream incoherently at it for awhile.  That's been eight or nine years ago now.  The house is gone, the people are gone, the pear tree is gone.  It seemed like a nice tree to me.  I don't know what her problem was with the thing.  But man, that tree  used to piss her off something fierce.  She had a whole fuck of a lot to say to that tree, and it was very, very loud, and went on until she was just screaming hoarsely at it, bellowing and making loud animal noises.  That got old pretty quick.  Yeah, I called the police. There's limits.  Howling at a pear tree at 11 p.m. is a limit that I had and I thought it was pretty reasonable.  No regrets."},

Remember That?", "date": "Friday, May 7, 2021", "text": "Remember the days when you got a new telephone?  You paid 25 dollars to get a new line, they gave you your choice of phone and a cord, and you plugged in the cord and lifted the receiver of the phone and got a dial tone?  It's taken two days to get my new modern big-girl phone activated.  One of the things they got hung up on was verification data. They wanted my fathers' middle name.My father did not have a middle name.  This seemed to bum the service representative out.  Now my mother had about three middle names and a maiden name too, but no.  My fathers full, obscure, weird, foreign Finnish name was not good enough for my new telephone services' needs.  They are welcome to dig my father up and yell at him for not having a middle name.  There's nothing I can do about it.There were also a series of secret number sequences and codes I had to enter to gain access to new 'rooms' of this dungeon quest.  The Boss would present me with more obscure questions to answer, and more numeric sequences to enter in order to gain the next goal on my journey.  It was honestly like this.I'd like to say that this was really me who did this stuff, but it was actually the Biker.  Once he activated my new phone, he had to contact my old telephone company and go through a similar routine. Chad from Hyderabad put him on hold a number of times so he could keep up his service quota (they count the number of hangups on the line and use this as a way to judge how many problems the representative is getting solved.  Which is nice for the representative, but not so awesome for the customer trying to talk to someone with a heavy Hyderabadian accent.) We are in the middle of day two of the Great Phone Switchover, and have been told that it will be another couple of hours before the phone is 'fully activated.'  Jesus, haul it up on an iron gurney during a fuckin' lightning storm or something!  It worked for Frankenstein!  I mean really?  Really?____________________________________The man who mows all the civic landscape features and I are friends.  I keep the parking strip out front mowed and edged, and he can skip right over it.  It takes this poor dude five days to mow and edge all the little stuff around town, like parking strips and easements and the city park and waterside trails, and it's a neverending process.  He has it down, though.  Seeing this guy mow across a super steep grade at 20 mph, neat and efficient, is a treat.  He brought me a bunch of lilacs last year as a thank-you present, and this year they're all blooming and smelling like Heaven.  Lesson:  Be good to your city employees and they will be good to you.  Turns out he's a cool guy.  We hung out in the driveway yesterday and he discussed mass corpse disposal in foreign countries.  I like anybody who can discuss low-tech mass cremation AND use a quad-deck rollover mower like a stock car.The dude who mows the big lots, like the school playground and undeveloped civic holdings is also a buddy of mine.  He'll get right up on my north border and save me a bunch of trouble because I have carniverous roses on that side, and his platoon of mower decks fits right underneath that and snug up against the wire fence.  I have  mower envy, actually.  Big Mowing Guy drives one of those big machines that have the wings on each side with six decks on each wing, and they raise and lower, and he can tool down the road and mow the super steep ditches.  I would love to have this job.  I would be a menace to public safety, but this would be one mowed-ass town.  I would mow the shit out of it.Just like Forest Gump.  Yup."},
{"title": "Watchin' The Crack Stroll", "date": "Saturday, May 1, 2021", "text": "I live in a town that has yet to break the four figure population mark.  People here in large part take pride in their homes, and the city takes good care of the public spaces and the infrastructure.  I live in the part that has actual sidewalks too!  It's funny - I can stand out in front of the house and look down East toward the Sumas River Bridge, where the sidewalk comes to an abrupt end, right there at the city limits. No sidewalk for you!  Buncha peasants.Sumas is a heritage community, meaning it was a city long before there was an America, and even before there was a border between Canada and America. Nobody seemed to mind too much.  Sumas back then was the name of a stretch of natural prairie that ran diagonally from the foothills of Mt. Baker up into Canada and stopped at, um, this mountain that I can see from my kitchen but I don't know the name of; but the Sumas River runs along the foot of it.Back in the long ago, the Canadians did a lot of hydrological-ag land use stuff to the Sumas River and it's tributaries that would never fly today.  In Canada it runs through controlled channels and has shunt stations for large scale crop irrigation. Here, it is a rut in the mud that does not deserve the name 'river' and how that distinction was even arrived at puzzles me because it is clearly A CRICK.There are three cricks in Sumas:  Bone Crick, Johnson Crick, and the Sumas River.  You can literally step across the Sumas River.  It is no more that eight feet deep at it's deepest here in the middle of town at the city park, where it was dredged for swimming years before.  No swimming now, boy.  And it's funny.  There's nothing wrong with the water.  The Sumas River is our drinking water; there's a pumping station and probably a few filters, and that's it, just a small installation meant mainly to control water pressure.  When I was a kid you could not have kept me out of that thing.  You could not have kept any kid out of any crick.  What the fuck, children of today?  Are tadpoles no longer awesome? Are water salamanders and frogs and sticklebacks uncool? Is the prospect of finding an old rusty pistol (I did) just boring as shit or something?  And what about making dams, which is the most awesome fun ever? GET OUTSIDE AND GO MAKE A DAM IN THE CRICK YOU LAZY NO GOOD KIDS. ________________________________Every day around 11:A.M. the crack customers start walking past my house, headed for the apartments the next block down.  That is where the community crack dealer lives, and there's a pair of shoes hanging over the telephone line and everything, nobody has any illusions about the situation, the police have discussed it with me as a known factor in passing (and clearly something they're in no hurry to put a stop to) and so...there ya go.The customers are friendly people.  If I'm out around 11:A.M. we'll stand and talk a bit.  They walk past quietly, go into the complex, cop, and then 45 minutes later they come a-stridin' back down the sidewalk, snapping and sparking, yelling at people on their cell phones, drawn up tight and rigid like someone with a spinal traction brace, got a purpose and a destination and there they go.I have never taken crack - which I find odd too, don't worry.  I don't know what it does to you.  I've heard a lot of different things, and hell, I might try it some day, if it comes my way.  The impression I get from what I observe is that it's like espresso for the unemployed.  These folks have this daily routine down to a science.  They find a way to get cash, they adhere to a strict schedule, they manage not to get caught, they do their thing and go straight back home.  No flailing down the middle of the street naked.  No shouting at cars or trees.  Presumably they just go home and hang out in the dark playing WoW or Mario Kart or something, eat some Cheetos, and fall asleep.  I've lived in the same little town for over twenty years with these people, and they manage to have some sort of a life, and are perfectly ordinary and acceptable folks...who like crack.  Or meth. I don't know. My point is, I guess, here I am in deepest, darkest rural America, and there's people out here who have been living full on meth-based lives for decades. Just getting through their days.In the early 1900's, the kindly ol' country doc would get the whole family addicted to heroin and then pass out Iron Butterflies and teach them how to shoot up. (Hey, it's how my grandmother got her scarlet paperver somniferums - a doctor gave her the seeds and asked her to grow it for him.  He compounded his own opiates.  Yup.) Every home had a fancy syringe in a velvet lined box with different sized needles to screw onto the end; I remember seeing them in people's homes.  They'd keep it in the sideboard and if someone got run through a threshing machine, out came the needle and the vial. By the time I came along it was just something that people kept in their display cabinets, like the octagon shaped vials for opium with chinese labels, and the cloissone opium pipes, with a chamber for a live coal.  Ten, twenty years down the road, maybe someone will be saying 'Oh that there?  That's Grandpa's crack pipe.  And that's Aunt Lucy's bong.  There's Uncle Edwards vape pen...oh, we all thought that was pretty impressive stuff, those vape pens...\""},

So we get a Class C, probably used.  We take long trips.  We return home.2. I have to contact a bunch of city employees about what it would take to demolish this house and put a singlewide or a Tiny House in it's place.  So far it's looking grim - and the city just updated our planning maps.  We are at 100% danger for a. A Mt. Baker Lahaar event  b. A huge seismic event, with massive areas of liquifaction   c. A total flood every single winter, with only four tiny little places in town that are naturally above the flood area.  We're used to this, though - it's a shallow flood and doesn't reach our foundations.  d.  Totally being wiped out by flaming lava if Mt. Baker becomes fully active   e. Attack by pterodactyls. Probably.  And all those things have to be taken into consideration when any new construction takes place here - which means massive honkin' fees.I'll tell you right now:  It's the devil you know.  We'll stay here.  We'll probably even stay in the same house and just let it kind of sag around us over the years.  Make friends with entropy.  Embrace change.I'll make the calls, but I'm pretty certain that we'll choose to stay in this house and just try and keep ahead of the major stuff.  Otherwise we're looking at putting in a special kind of foundation made for clay-base seismic conditions prone to flooding, which means that it would be five freakin' feet tall and cost one metric bajillion dollars before we even get to the part where the singlewide gets plopped on top. It would look ridiculous standing five feet up in the air like a boxcar on a plinth, and it would also have to have Hurricane Alley tiedowns because of the high winds here; plus it would be utterly exposed to the full force of the wind.  By the time all that effort and money has been spent; naaaaaaah, fuck it.So yeah.  That's all I got."},
{"title": "Are You On The Bus Or Off The Bus?", "date": "Tuesday, April 27, 2021", "text": "The School bus dream has been punctured.  I feel bad for my husband, who was really caught up in the whole romance of the nomadic retirement lifestyle.  Shit, it's something I've dreamed about doing for years.  But the thing is - this is no longer 1968.The State and Federal government, not to mention the insurance companies, are all up in this whole nomadic lifestyle situation nowadays.  You cannot just jump into a bus, hang up a few posters of Krishna, fire off the incense and head out,  staying in supermarket parking lots and on abandoned beaches.  Those days are LONG FUCKING GONE.  And it was such a buzzkill to find out.  The least part of your worries is the actual conversion process. The monster is Insurance, Licensing, Certification, Inspections, and how far off the grid you expect to live.  The further off, the more intimate you are going to get with the end results of digestion, and your tolerance of extremes in temperature and your companions' moods.  Not a good recipe for two old intrepid individualists with ADHD, OCD, PTSD and the rest of the fuckin' alphabet.Then there's the fact that those old rust-buckets break down A Lot.  Oh, the Internet has been an enlightening and ultimately helpful place.  Look up 'Schoolies' and you'll find gazillions of sites.  These things will just shit the bed and there you are at the side of the road.  Fucked.  Imagine that tow bill.  Imagine that engine replacement, shit. When we used to nomad on a  motorcycle, it was pretty sweet.  You were in the wide open, just you, your comrade, and your credit cards.  You had the whole world, you could park anywhere, you could tent it if your back could take that hard ground (my husbands, sadly, cannot. And yes, chillun, that's my fault.  Oh hell yes it is and I am not sorry.) and if you did not wish to experience nature from within the confines of a nylon dodecahederon, surrounded by predators, you could sleep in a super cheap, shitty motel - hell, all you need is a place to lock up your stuff, catch some Z's and bathe, and then you're off on the road agin. That's why there's a book called Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, and not Zen and the Art of Keeping A Giant Tube of Steel From Blowing Over In A Windstorm.  Motorcycling really is spiritual.  You are In It.  It cleans out your mind and refreshes your soul.  You meet amazing people, not just average citizens, but folks with a story to tell, people with beliefs and experiences and things to say that are worth hearing.So now we're thinking about maybe getting our house demolished and putting up a Tiny House, or a Single Wide in it's place.  Just staying right here, but in a reliable, up to code space that gives us room to be solitary when we need solitude and companionable when we have to watch the second season of The Umbrella Academy or videos of cats falling off the back of couches.  We have always lived simply.  Even now that we do not have to live simply, we choose to continue to do so, because we are fundamentally flower children who agree that thinking globally while acting locally is a responsible way for humans to live on this planet.  But we also want to travel and do the whole 'See America First' thing too.  It's been our dream all along.It seems like the ideal solution would be to purchase a reasonably sized motor home, a smaller one, like a Chinook, and use that to travel in.  Most parks will turn down a school bus, or anything older than ten years - fact! but they'll accept a well-kept vintage vacation wagon no problem.  It's the perfect compromise between simple living and cheap travel - our costs would be low, and we could take a motel room when we got to feeling grubby. Unfortunately it also means that your home, for the duration of your trip, is also your sole means of transport.  The Biker can no longer spend much time on a motorcycle, and I have a huge chunk out of my leg from the first and last time I tried to ride one (A tale for another day.)  I suppose a scooter would work, like a Vespa.  Two people's worth of groceries will fit nicely in the little storage panniers.  We've stripped out campers and carried a motorcycle, and that works just fine.  You really do not need most of the stuff they put in those things, like the cabinets and sinks and ovens and shit. That's why the Baby Jesus invented soft frame luggage.  It works like a charm.  All you need out of the space is a place to sleep and change clothes, a place to take a private shit out of the weather, and a way to keep the thing warm/cool.  You need to keep weight down to keep gas costs down. You have a little dorm room fridge, and you eat a lot of sandwiches and drink a lot of beer and buy bricks of bottled water.  That credit card gets used for restaurants, gas, repairs, fees and entertainment.  You've got your laptop, you've got a solar panel or two, and you don't stay on the road for interminable amounts of time.This really works.  It worked when we had a little kid, and we've got it down to a science.  So we'll see.  But damn, those dreams just...to be too old to do something, that's a bitch.  Back in the beginning we were going to buy a wooded lot, mill our own lumber, age it while we lived in a yurt for four years, then build ourselves an open plan cabin and live up on Highway 9. (Lest you think we dreamed, the Biker used to build cabins precisely this way up in Alaska for people.  Dude knows his construction.  He's badass.)  We'd sell the yurt, and be money ahead. Yes, there is a swingin' market for yurts here in Puget Sound. Imagine that!Plan 2 was to live on the RiverFarm Commune, until we actually visited the RiverFarm Commune and saw how squalid life was for the communards; illiterate peopled with some really, really peculiar ideas about things all living off the income from illegal dope grows and meth production who had no electricity and were taking their water from the river in buckets, and shitting in three-sided outhouses. Nope. Full Nope. Nopeity nope nope.So we bought the lot, which had a single wide on it already.  And that worked.  We didn't even have to mill any lumber!  We lived on a wooded lot up on Mt. Baker in a very nice single wide, and I had the whole place landscaped and looking gorgeous, and there we were, living our dream.  After all, a Tiny House is basically a singlewide.  I'd go back to it in a minute.  Unfortunately, the school system sucked, so we had to move into the flatlands to get our daughter into a decent educational environment that didn't have quite so many meth heads and people living in bunkers preparing for the Y2K virus,  KKK sympathizers, religious nuts and violent rednecks.  That's the tradeoff.  You are living in the boonies.  The boonies are full of freaky people.  Whole extended families who lived in compounds deep in the woods and cranked out inbred babies.  And the cult-type religious communities.  Lots of those up off Highway Nine.  A leader who'd been given a message and gathered a group of believers, fire and brimstone, arranged marriages - you think that shit only happens in the Ozarks?  Oh no no no.  So we moved into our little house here in our little dot on the map, and enrolled our daughter in a school where she was actually made to do her schoolwork and attend classes, and we were actually encouraged to be part of the process;  and most of the teachers could read, so we were ahead on that score.  She went on to do very well in life.  That wouldn't have happened had we stayed upmountain.Now the effort of trying to talk to The Biker about this begins.  It will be difficult.  He gets caught up in his plans and cannot be swayed, and digs in his heels and...yeah.  I'm just as bad.  I skim the essentials, make up my mind, and everything else is just 'details'.  Also not conducive to rational decision making.  I mean, this is how things are going to end up.  We've been skirting this outcome for years, although why it should be a matter of unpleasantness or hesitation eludes me.  I dread the emotional turmoil that's going to take place during the next five years, as it goes from being my idea to it's being HIS idea.

Baker to one of the snowline camps.  Mr. School bus was never meant to go up large mountains.  Particularly not a damn school bus with  marble countertops and stainless steel full sized appliances.One thing an old school bus is really good for is growing dope.  Of course that's legal here now, so those dank smelling old busses are being hauled out of the undergrowth with 'For Sale' signs in the algae covered windshields.  And they are being snapped up as soon as they get hauled to the side of the road.  People are buying them to live in permanently, parked, home sweet home.The tiny house thing is growing here.  And I blame that on the housing boom and Covid.  The Biker works with people who actually live in retrofitted garden sheds.  Yeah, it's cheap, your bills are low, you sneak in under a lot of rules, regulations and taxes, but damn, a single dude coming home to a garden shed...that's grim.  And as you know, I lived in a garden shed for awhile.  I can attest to the fact that it is in reality a very grim lifestyle, except when it hails, and then it's loud, but kinda neat.___________________________The robin is back.  Come to find out the instant these little shits fledge a nest full of chicks they go right on and start another family.  Some robins have three different families going with three different hens, which means that robins have somewhat elastic morals, but really have that 'cranking out the offspring' thing down pat.  Unfortunately it means that cock robin is spending 90% of his time super jacked up on testosterone, which causes him to attack his own reflection because he is being a dude with way too many things going on in his little birdy life.  Someone should do something. That's what I think."},

The weather has been prime, my garden is saWEEET,  I am now the block Grandma, and all the kids know me, and I know them.  There is Raler, Um yeah him, Oh Yeah Uh, See That Kid? and Him.'Um Yeah Him' is kind of displeased because he was given a bright metallic fuschia bike, and I can't blame the little dude.  Yes, it's brand new and it was abandoned in a rental garage in his building, but he's all boy, this one, about two steps up from eating dirt and bare-ass crapping in the great outdoors, and he doesn't want a bright fuschia bike, that's sissy!  He told me \"Here, you're a girl, you ride this girl bike.\"I have not ridden a bike in a few years, but oh, in my heyday, I was a daredevil.  This was just before stunt bikes, so I cannot say that I did flips and tricks, but I could stand on the center rail and glide standing up with my arms out, which is pretty damn cool.  Anyway, I jumped on Um Yeah Hims little bike, your standard dirt tracker, and surprised myself and all the kids in the neighborhood by flying around the block, through the field, doing scrapes and tight turns and all that goofy crap. (All the exercise I did this winter totally paid off!)  I had a line of five little kids running and laughing fit to bust after  me as I zigzagged around the field, and then I had to stop and laugh too.  It was pretty cool.See That Kid loves sedums.  He has one at his house, as he has told me, and he pulls all the dead leaves off it and keeps it in the brightest window. He likes it because it's dinosaury.  He is one of those little grade school boys you can tell is already 40 years old minus the vocabulary and experience, just a sweet, mild, sensible soul.  I have got a pot of sedums that I started for him so that he can maybe catch the spark of gardening.Grandiose?  Moi?Oh Yeah Uh See That Kids' name is actually Memphis.  He's a 'Third shepherd from the left' kind of kid, always in the middle of the pack but kind of shy.  His mother is a beautician and he frequently shows up with gleaming magenta or peacock blue hair.  I don't know if he likes it or not, but at least he stands out.  He also likes to sneak into my back yard and hang out under a salix contorta I have and play with his different action figures and cars.  Ida killed for this tuff little fort, right?I see the sag in my wire fence, and I've seen his little hind end booking across the field as soon as I came out into the back yard, so yeah, I know it's him.  I'm not enraged or anything.  I will have to put up a taller fence.  But oh my heart... I found a little hollow that he made under an evergreen tree I have out back, like the kinds of little nest-forts I used to make when I was a kid, to smell the foliage and play with my toy cars, and  my grandma-heart just goes out to this little guy.  I get it, Oh Yeah Uh See That Kid.  I'll put up a taller fence, but I've left a lot of branches and things sneak off over the property line and through the fence so you'll always have a little fort to hang out in, just outside the fence in the shade and tall iris. Because I'm fuckin' totally awesome._________________________________The Biker and I spent today going to garage sales (for the first time in 13 months!!!!!!!) and doing a little recreational spending. It felt really good.  In fact, it felt like a return to something fun and important that's been missing in our lives, without our even realizing it was missing.  We have been talking about going back into the Swap Meet game for years now, getting a recreational vehicle with a lot of storage space and just hitting swap meets with our table and stock, caravanning around the PNW, getting in to the meets early and partying with the other dealers, bullshitting, wheeling and dealing in the sellers parking lot before and after hours, when the best stuff comes out and the amazing deals get done.  We did that quite a bit while The Stainless Steel Amazon was a teenager. We made a chunk of change and a lot of business contacts that have lasted over the years.  Now that it's a viable full time option, we've been watching all these 'Schoolbus Makeovers' and 'Vintage Motorhome Resto's' on YouTube.  See, we have a metric shitpile of vintage stock left over from those days, well boxed and just waiting to be dispersed among the populace.  We used to do a bangin' business every meet, cars, motorcycles and antiques, and interestingly enough, it's something that The Biker and I can do together, as a team, a natural Good Cop Bad Cop team - it just comes naturally to us. Sexxxy, armed, devious.  My marriage in three words.  We felt some of that magic come back to us at an estate sale we went to today.  As a team we are unbeatable.  This was a sale being run by an estate liquidation company, and we had that whole property dicked and down after five minutes. Shee-it.   We had the money mapped and our contacts uppermost in our thoughts and we just kept looking at one another with that 'We still got it!\" grin.  And that's the thing - the sum is greater than the parts with us.  It's the best feeling in the world scouting around like a couple of spies and reporting back to each other, tempting people back to our lot, swapping, raiding, talking the trade - and it's all 'our' people!I am super stoked.  I feel like there's hope for the future in this, for us as an active team out in the world doing something interesting that we both really enjoy, that has history and travel, dead peoples' belongings and lots of partying and bullshit mixed in with it.  It would be bomb ass if we spent this next winter down a couple of USDA zones, going to swaps, hanging out, seeing old friends, following the Rust Trail.  Those sparks of hope, man, you gotta keep them alive.  Meanwhile, I have a glow-in-the-dark garden turtle figurine, and the Biker has a hand-forged sledge hammer and a tractor pull trophy, dammit.  One mans trash..."},

So I had a conversation with Neighborhood Crackhead while I was upside down lying on the grass with his big ol' dog sitting on my chest. He just leaned over and talked down to my face about Portugeuse dogs for awhile.  OK then.  The Biker came up and they got talking about Portugeuse dogs, and meanwhile I was rolled across the lawn by Chica and generally treated like a big ol' dog toy.I can think of worst ways to end an evening."},

Far be it from me to turn down exploitable teenage labor._____________________________I have a new best friend.  It stands three feet tall and has cute little wheels.  It is AN AIR CONDITIONER and it is in my bedroom and I LOVE IT.  My room stayed a steady 65 degrees all night, I slept like a log, the air was moving; and like Wynonas Big Brown Beaver, I wish I did have a pair.  I am astounded how efficient this thing is.  Five minutes, room is nicely chilled.  And my room faces SSW.  The hottest room in the house.  Not anymore!You want cool?  I got cool. I got aaaallll the cool, baby.We ARE getting insulation, by the way.  I keep dropping reminders, The Biker keeps sighing and the message is working its way into his brain: Insulation.  Heat tape.  NE winds that last 14 days and nights at a crack. Age = sucks.  Warmth = good.  Comfort = good.  Old bitchy chilly whiny wife = Not Good. Very persistent, though. _____________________________Two weeks ago it was snowing in the foothills two miles away.  This week we're going to be hitting 80f.  This is as extreme a seasonal change as I've ever seen.  Being able to go outside in a t-shirt and sandals is like a blessing.  Leaving the windows and doors open and living the indoor-outdoor life just feels so right, like being let out of prison.  This past winter really drove home for me and the Biker as well just how indoor-outdoor 'whole property'  we live. There's always something to do, the garage is open, the sheds are open, various power tools are being used, projects are being constructed...we are cozy homebodies and super house-proud. The barbecue is always at our crib. We invented the staycation. \"Wow Dad, we can fit two whole puppies on our new grill!  That's keen!\"So of course when the Biker told me that he had a birthday party planned for me with guests that he'd already invited, I had a spaz fit and a panic attack.  It was not beautiful or appropriate. AAAAAAAA NOT GUESTS OMG PEOPLE HUMANS SPAZ TRIP FREAK NO GOD NOGod I hate being this way.  Two days later I'm like 'what the fuck was I thinking?  Where the fuck did that come from?  Why did I freak out like that?'  I know these people.  They're our friends.  I feel totally fine about the idea today.  But that's a sign I'm going in the right direction, anyway.  Two more days of adjusted dosage under my belt is duct-taping my synapes back together in friendly configurations. It's a process.  I wish it were a faster process, but at least I'm seeing positive progress, so there's that.And TULIPS!!"},

Ha!\" And in another week I can take all the plastic bottles down from the shrubs and trees...that look demented...and recycle those.  I'm looking forward to it.Getting my new medications adjusted has been quite the interesting trip.  It's ongoing.  Upside:  I'm mildly high until about 1:00 in the afternoon, when the heebie jeebies start knocking at the back of my brain. \"What if you have cancer and you don't know it? What if someone has been watching you through binoculars for years here in town and they're going to kill you?  What if your husband is in the hospital with a heart attack right now and it's just nobody has called you yet? What if we get shitty insulation and next winter - no I can't face another winter - OH GOD NOOOOOOOOOOO\" aaaaand FirstNations takes herself a Valium and a couple of mood stabilizers. And I chew them.  Like candy.They do not taste good. But they hit my system fully deployed and ready to cross that blood-brain barrier, God bless 'em; and ten, fifteen minutes go by?  Life is normal.  It stays normal until just before bed, when I take a handful of pills and ten, fifteen minutes later BOOM out like a light for eight blessed, unbroken hours of sleep.And no weird horse dreams.  That's key.Just thinking of you makes my nipples tingle, baby.   I was having dreams so jam-packed with activity and people and shifting storylines that it was waking me up. Remember those rooms in electronics stores where there were twenty-five televisions all tuned to the same channel?  Imagine that room, but every television is on a completely different channel, and the sound is cranking.  Yeah, sleep  through that shit.Another strange thing that happened was that I was waking up and not being quite sure where I was - the house I grew up in, or the house I live in now, or the house I was just dreaming about.  Or waking up not knowing which direction I was facing, which is hard to explain so just take that one on faith; it's weird. That's a mild form of hypnogogic hallucination.  And that disorder is common on the ground. Ten percent of the population have it.  Stephen King has it.  (Explains a lot, right?)  In fact Stephen King has a subtype called 'Old Hag Syndrome'.                                       It's 2:A.M. and you got some 'splainin to do, Stephen.    You wake up paralyzed with a horrible old woman sitting on your chest, trying to strangle you, or just generally being a scary bitch.  Whole towns in Africa have this form of HH.  It runs in families.  Now why so specific?  Why not...a small cow?   I'M PISSED OOOOFF!  I'M REALLY PISSED OOOOFF! Right? That would be fucked up. You wake up paralyzed and there's a small angry cow standing on your chest looking at you? Why not a cow?  I do not have the answer to that question. Anyway.   You know what I did to celebrate getting my shit together?  I took all that free money that Mr. Biden sent me, went online and I spent $214.00 on clothes.  Thank you Uncle Joe.  Now the world will know that I love Jimi Hendrix. They will goggle in wonder at H.R. Gigers image 'Alien - In Space No One Can Hear You Scream' plastered all over my tits. The will know that I work in the Science Department of the USS Enterprise. They will know that I am an alumnus of Miskatonic University. People will see that I like John Lee Hooker.  They will be exposed to the idea that I hope that they will 'Live Long And Prosper' but they won't be able to read the message as such because it's written in the Vulcan ceremonial script tanaf-kitaun.  Not Gotavlu zukitaun; pfft. Tanaf-kitaun. Yeah that's right.                                                             Dif tor heh smusa, y'all.  I was looking at my clothes a couple days ago while I was folding laundry, and realized 'Shit, my stuff is seriously beat!  That will not do!' (This is the kind of everyday thing you miss when you're working on a case of depressive psychosis.) So Uncle Joe bought me some killer dorklord t-shirts, paid for some new pairs of pants, and a lot of socks.  Tell ya what, I'm hooked.  Buying clothes online is The Shiz.   And I completely replaced all my shit for $214.00!!!  But the best part is not having to go to a store full of icky freaky germy people, spend my gas money, and probably not find what I want.  You can't go into, say, Penny's, and grab an H.R. Giger t-shirt.  Nope. \"Can't you go check in back? What do you mean you don't sell those here?  I've bought them here before.  No, I'm upset.  I'm really upset.  I want to talk to a manager.  No H.R. Giger T-shirts in stock like you expect me to believe that? Ha, you're just too lazy and ugly and stupid to go check. I'll stand right here.  Everybody?  Everybody?  I want you to look at the laziest excuse for a clerk in America right here.  She won't go in back and check and see if they have my shirt in stock.  It's ridiculous.  Why is the manager taking so long?  I'm going to sue you and this company for my time.  I mean it.  My time is valuable.  I'll do it.\"   Go online, you find nothing BUT H.R. Giger T-shirts, man, you just type that shit in!  I want grey, straight-leg women's trousers? With pockets?  Type it in. Order it. At your house in two days.

I ain't playin.\"I wish I had a camera so I could show you how gooned out on testosterone this animal is.  I stood in the window and made shooing motions, rapping on the glass, and the little fucker just glared at me from the roof of my shed. Every dominance display you'd see your average barnyard rooster put on, this robin is doing. Puffing out his chest.  Flaring his wings. Holding an upright stance and giving me the side-eye the whole time. Leaning in like he's going for my throat. \"I am beaming pure hatred at you with the power of my MIND!\"    You see?  This is the kind of shit I have to put up with.  That right there ^^.   Listen. I own this house, motherfucker, don't come around all...menacing me, or...whatever, you idiot.  You're the size of an orange.And all while this was going on, a little chickadee had caught sight, and was so - I'm guessing - fascinated, that it began to creep closer to Dumbass Robin just to check him out.  Hop, hop, pause.  Hop, hop, closer, pause.  No bigger than a spool of thread, but fully capable of appreciating stupidity when he sees it.This chickadee (also a male, also in fresh mating plumage) eventually made it to within three inches! of Dumbass Robin, while Dumbass Robin is wholly focusing the rage of one thousand suns on the elderly woman in the kitchen window beating on the glass with a spatula.  That chickadee just watched. Right overhead Dumbass Robin is calling me a butthole, and a poophead and telling me I'm ugly and stupid and a fatty fatty two by four or whatever curses robins use, and this little, tiny bird is just considering it, like, 'Damn.  I've seen some stupid in my time, but...damn.\"Here's the punchline.  After all this chest-beating and name calling?

Psychosis.  Not just another pretty word.   Well, here I am.  Hello space.  Hello mushrooms.Frankly I am having a grand old time.  Some times a medication change can feel like immanent destruction of all life on earth.  This?  Well, I feel, um...different, and this will go on until I get adjusted to the new chemicals in my brain.  I'm a little woozy (read: baked.)  You know what; after the past couple of weeks?  I'll take legally baked.  Yes I will.  I deserve it.  I weeded the living Hell out of my garden beds today, and didn't think about death, suicide, avian flu or anything negative whatsoever!Mr. Swanky Oyster approves of them legal pharms, yo._________________________I have a robin that is bound and determined to beat it's brains out on my windows.  It's the male robin (a thrush here, not a cute tiny birdie like in the UK) and he's jacked up on testosterone and territoriality.\"Are you talking to me?  Are YOU?  Talking to ME?\"  He sees his reflection in the window and long story short, I had to construct a thing out of plastic jugs and set it next to the window in hope that he gets freaked out by this plastic golem and quits bashing into my fucking front picture window.  He sits on my front railing, squaring up for his next sally, and opens the pod bay doors just as he launches himself glass-ward. Like bashing into my window starting at 7 A.M. isn't bad enough, he's got to shit up my front porch.  And smear up my window!All birds are greasy.  I don't know why a songbird would be greasy, but they are, and this goes for any bird that might smack into your window.  They leave your window looking like someone threw an order of french fries at it, which is, frankly, icky.  I had to clean the railing, the porch, and both huge windows, and the glass was top to bottom bird smears - the greasy prints of wings, feet, beak, tiny feathers.  Oh, but he thought he'd be sly and change sides.  Soon I hear him bouncing himself off my husbands big bedroom windows in the back of the house.  Just bash fluster, bash fluster, bash fluster, like a metronome.  I had to tie shiny bottles onto a nearby branch; and that took care of his self-destructive tendencies.  After a couple of hours of quiet?  Right back to the front room windows again.  One arts and crafts project later, and a lot of water and a squeegee, and I hope like hell he gets the message.  This doofus is hitting that window full tilt boogie.  It sounds like someone is literally throwing this poor bird at the window as hard as they can, over and over.  Maybe he's given himself brain damage or something.  I have noted a distinctly crazed look in his eye - and he's a big, bright, shiny male with all his mating characteristics super prominent, like a caricature. Like a 'hood robin.  Like a 'Just got out of two years in prison' robin.One of us is going down, boy, and it ain't gonna be me, reflection robin!   See how pronounced all the white markings around the neck and particularly the eyes are on these robins?  That's what happens to you when you are crazed on testosterone and you are a robin.  The females are distinctly more muted in coloration, and they stick to the shrubs and lower branches, or pluck at worms nearby, and are probably kind of embarrassed by this behavior.  His job is supposed to be making a nest, not smacking himself into his own reflection.  If I left this go on long enough she'd eventually come up onto the porch with a gleam in her eye, and they'd have a flustering, midair disagreement, he'd get his head pecked, and he'd get over himself and go out and gather nesting materials.  And be perfectly happy to do so, until he catches a glance of what he thinks is another male robin trespassing on HIS territory.  THIS MEANS WAR. Male robins will tear big old chunks of feathers out of one another in the springtime and crash in midair and fall to the ground and fight; they're in it to win it.   In this idiots' case, it's his reflection.  Man, he hates that bastard."},
{"title": "Ruh Roh", "date": "Wednesday, March 31, 2021", "text": "Note:  Not a Cheerful Walk Among The Daffodils._______________Among other things, I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, which has chosen the Spring of the year to come back with a vengeance.This sounds like a fake thing even to me, and I have it.  I know.  But it's so peculiar and so unnatural and scary that I can truly understand why people used to believe in demons, because when it hits, it's not like any other kind of fear or apprehension.  It comes out of nowhere, for no reason, and it  consumes you body and soul.Imagine ramping up into full panic.  For no reason.  I mean the kind of nervous, terrified, helpless panic that hits you in a hospital bed, or after a car accident, as it dawns on you what just happened.  That's what GAD feels like to me.Luckily I have an understanding psychiatrist and I'm taking care of it.  But what the hell, universe?  Why now?  I don't know if any of you have anything like this, but you have  my sincere sympathy if you do.  None of  those \"Just _____________\" suggestions simply do not work because when this shit hits,  you don't have the access to those parts of your brain anymore.  Like 'Just take deep, calming breaths.'  I am the Grand Master of Deep Calming Motherfucking Breaths.  Doesn't do Jack Shit.  This is not to say that I eschew Deep Calming Breaths; shit, I'm willing to try anything up to a full on goat sacrifice just to make this shit go away.  I have a mantra. It does not work.  I have a safe place, and people to call and talk to. Mantra does not work. Talking to people and being safe does not help.  That part of your brain that can use those tools is turned OFF.  You can think of those things, you can try to do them, but your body chemistry has other plans for you. Sometimes I think about it as being this channel my mind seems to be tuning in to whether or not I want it to.  I think of it as a definite bandwidth, certain limits where it comes in loud and clear with a blast of  total static disruption.  You doppler up and down, but you can't escape that station until something in your brain changes.  And you can't turn the channel.  While you are tuned in to this station, everything you are as a person is expressed on that bandwidth.  For as long as it lasts, what you think, what you feel, what you decide and what you do are defined and circumscribed by this thing.  You can make yourself do 'normal' things, but that ability is limited, and you have to choose your low static moments and plot out your next few activities at top speed, before the hard fear comes back and all you can do is pace, unable to make a decision, unable to stop 'doom ideation', unable to stop 'suicidal ideation', unable to take in information without it's going through the bandwidth and becoming a 'bad' thought. I see a car pass by and I think about what would happen if it crashed through the house.  I see the birds outside and I think about Avian Flu and salmonella.  I had to drive myself to the pharmacy today and I kept thinking about engine fires, head-on collisions and 'sudden flying vehicle, Russian Style' type incidents as I crept along at 20 mph in the school zone nearby. You tell yourself it's not real, it won't happen, you fucking flat out KNOW IT'S ALL BULLSHIT and it Does Not Matter.  Your mind and body have decided to panic whether you like it or not.  So you only have sheer will? Cussedness? Contrariness? To get you through those moments. I don't know what it is, but it's in damned short supply.  And there have been three occasions in my life now that I completely lost that quality and was overcome.  The first two times I was 'bearhugged' through it.  Look it up.  They use this method on autistic kids and it works. The third time I did something stupid.  Luckily my liver and kidneys were on my side that day.If it hit like that again, and I didn't have any backup,  I'd do myself to get away from it. So there's my deepest darkest fear revealed:  That I have a thing made of horror that is tracking me, like Ged in the Earthsea books, and it is part of me and will eventually win. You can get into treatment cycle of diminishing returns with GAD.  Downers treat it, but the side effect of too many downers is drug tolerance and, you guessed it, GAD.  Booze solves it, but booze is entirely too seductive in my case. I stay hydrated. Get all my vitamins. Avoid red meat. Exercise. I've spent the last week getting all my medications recalibrated and taking blood tests (I passed!) and so far it's looking like I might be a cunthair too high on the thyroid medications, like off by 5 fucking milligrams, so there's that to try and see if shit doesn't change in the next week.Sitting here feeling the medication wear off and that black channel tune back in, bit by bit, is eerie as hell.  You feel your heart rate begin to accelerate.  Your breathing gets thin and rapid.  Your whole body tenses up.  And remember, there's no reason for this to be happening.  That's frightening in and of itself.  You literally feel yourself...I have to put it this way...losing your mind.  Or at least a good part of it.So here I am trying to read my goddamn Viking Sagas and my Cloisters Apocalypse, and editing a story I wrote (because I know how to party) and just chilling out to some jazzlike sounds on this one channel, blogging.  It's a nice sunny day, I'm relaxed, comfortable, and yet I can feel it creeping up even as I sit here typing.  Just a little tingle of apprehension in the back of my mind.  Like the cold, nagging worry you feel when you send your child off to play at a friends house for the very first time.  And I'm feeling this for absolutely No Reason Whatsoever.  My choices are very, very limited at this point. I can sit here and see what happens - it might just fade away.  Or I can get proactive and medicate - and ace myself out of being able to  interact with the adult world on a meaningful level; because I'll be loose as a goose on a measly 5mg Valium.  Knocks me on my ass.  As does Diazapam.  And a few other mood stabilizers I can't remember the name of right off, but that I take in minute doses, and that fuck me up.  Some people can do that, go out and maintain and be all competent.  I cannot.  I am a pathetic, sloppy, sentimental high person, one who will reveal embarrassing facts about my marriage, profess my platonic love for you unto eternity and gladly fill  you in on the Middle Ages without provocation and get all the names and dates wrong.  Either way, I can't make grown-up plans for the rest of the day. It's a good time to call me up, though.  I am entertaining as hell, from what I've been given to understand.Feel absolutely free to give me any tips, tricks, links, what have you.  I'll be here."},

Ancient Egypt 4. Mayas/Aztecs/Human Sacrifice 5.Elizabethan England.  And then they're off!  Just about every nerd I know personally went through the same progression as a little kid.Except my granddaughter.She took the following path:  1.Planking.  From the time she was 4 days old (yes, really) this kid could plank like an internet star.  She could plank between two chairs, the table and a chair, you name it. I would stick the kid into place and then stack toys and stuff on her tummy.  We have a couple of pictures of this, in fact. I could fly her around the house and she'd be like a carbon-fiber glider, just laughing up a storm. Her mother was less than pleased, but....her mother. Ahem.  2. Hauling around live chickens.  Everywhere.  3. Peas, because what's not to love about climbing peas? 4. ACORNS.  The kid was obsessed with acorns.  Her life was acorn-centric.  She would only listen to acorn stories and look at acorn pictures.  We visited Old Salem Village while all the trees were shedding acorns, and that kid was in her element.  She told me that she was the queen of the squirrels and her squirrel army would enslave all the other squirrels and steal their acorns.  This was quite the Squirrellian Iliad, too. She was about six and you could tell that she'd really been thinking about her strategy.\"Is she even interested in the Egyptians?\" I asked my daughter, the Stainless Steel Amazon (AKA 'Mega Karen')\"Not a lot of acorns in Egypt,\" my daughter sighed.  \"I've tried.  We've all tried.  Nope.  Acorns.  Her nightstand is full of them.  There's always acorns in the wash.\"(Grandma brag) Both grandkids are in magnet schools, way ahead of the curve, so if they want to haul chickens around - or create a YouTube cooking show starring a dachshund, like my grandson just did, then more power to them.  It's just the FirstNation gene momentarily effecting their cognitive functions._________________________The most annoying human being in the world is Zawi Hawass.  He is ruining Ancient Egypt for everybody.  If anyone high up in the Egyptian government is lurking on here, would you please fire him already?  He's a freaking national embarrassment.  He is a spaz and a twat.  This dude was clearly raised as mommy's Precious Princeling.  It's not a good look on a grown-ass man, anonymous Egyptian governmental lurker. Fire his ass now.  I mean it.___________________________________There are different levels of flipping someone off.  Apparently I am the only person who remembers this, so let's review.Let's say Joe flipped someone off.  You would say \"Wow, you shoulda seen Joe flip the eagle.\"  Or \"Joe didn't say shit, he just shot an/the eagle and walked off.\"  1. Eagle.  Just flipping someone off in a no-nonsense manner.  The hand is not clenched.  The thumb protrudes gently from one side. The forearm is raised at a right angle to the floor, and the gesture is made at face level or slightly raised.  This is the classic Eagle.2. Double Eagle.  Same as above, but using both hands.3. Full Eagle. Standing up (and leaning in a bit for style points) specifically to perform an Eagle.3. Full Double Eagle Royale, which is a standing Double Eagle used while giving voice to multiple swears, such as 'Fuck ya ya fuckin' fucker and fuck your fuckin' mother, ya motherfuckin' fucker, yeah, fuckin' fuck you.\"4. Flying an Eagle. Rolling down the window of your car to stick your arm outside and execute an Eagle while in traffic.  My personal specialty.5. Flying Double Eagle. When both driver and passenger fly an Eagle in traffic.  The Biker and I are past masters of this art.  It's like synchronized swimming, man, we're rolling down the windows in tandem and BOOM shakalaka, our car has Wings of Vengeance.  A Rancho FirstNations trademark move.6. Screaming Eagle.  See above, and add horn honking and/or shouted invective.7. Imperial Eagle. Torso entirely out of car window flying a Double Eagle and screaming invective.  If you are the driver, and are also honking the car horn using your knee, you are in 'Legend' territory and become a demigod.I can't believe I'm the only person who remembers this. Of course I was in 7th grade and haven't matured much since then, so there's that. ________________________________I just had my prozac dosage increased.  One of the side effects is extremely vivid and peculiar dreams.  But see, that's my life, man.  That's every single night for me, my whole fuckin' life.  I'd never noticed any difference on the lower dose.  Not a bit.  And then...I dreamed last night that a brown horse fell passionately in love with me.  At first the horse and I were just playing, but the tumbling and chasing began to take on an intimate note, and finally the horse rolled over and asked me (using these very words) \"See if you can scratch my nipples effectively.\" This is not something a horse says to you every day.  It had a tummy like a dog, not a horse. I decided to leave the horse at this moment, because I was weirded out, and I was busy helping some people clean out a garage (?) but the horse kept sneaking around peeking at me around corners and through windows, and from behind bushes.  Don't listen to the bullshit out there about Prozac.  It's the most fun you can have while totally unconscious!______________________________"},

Note Gary's expression.  Cue my future.  Premonition?  One wonders.We watch a lot of stuff from the YouTube channel here.  Oddly, one of our big faves is watching guys turn wood burls into various shapes, usually bowls, but not always.**  It's really fascinating, and some of these guys are incredibly brave and innovative, making things that seem to defy physics, that look more fluid than solid.  This is not your hippie aunt's live-edge wood bowl. She sold that for .50 at her last garage sale.  See footnote.The problem is, the Biker and I have totally different interests when it comes to what we like to binge watch.  Me, I'll listen to that robot British voice on the Reddit videos for hours.  Him?  Cars.Now I've bitched about this before and I'll bitch about it again, I promise.  This guy will literally watch anything as long as it is car-centric.  FOR HOURS.   I've already mentioned the 437,916,y73,975,697,832,100000 car wreck compilations; talk about visual torture. They're just cars.  Any cars. Getting in wrecks. And there are thousands of these compilations online.  Note to self: Cancel that trip to Russia.  All the Biker sees is cars, not human tragedy, not vodka, just cars.  Anything will do, he's not at all picky.  He'll watch videos of cars in parking lots. Literally some guy with a cell phone rambling around in store parking lots making video about the cars he walks past.  That is a thing.  Cars on streets.  Cars in car collections.  Cars being auctioned off.  Cars sitting in the weeds. New cars. Old cars. Trucks (technically cars, apparently.) Cars being dropped from cranes. Cars falling off cargo ships.  Cars being test-driven; and not high performance cars either, just sedans and shit. Cars going up mountains.  Cars going down mountains.  Cars...just...going places. Cars not going places.  Fixed cars being broken.  Broken cars being fixed. I have to admit that there's some interesting and even entertaining stuff out there in the Mr. Fixit's Garage genre.  But the vast, vast majority of the 'My Home Shop' shows are some dude with a voice like a goddamn dial tone wrenching away endlessly on some rusted hulk.  And just...no commentary, no nothing.  Just a depressing, messy garage with oil stains on the floor and some guy jacking away at a stuck nut.   This is where I'd put a provocative and tasteless picture gleaned from the internet after a leading comment like that.   One of the less than entertaining subsets of the Mr. Fixit video genre is Annoying Host and his Shitty Cars, AKA Wow I'm So Wacky Look At Me Return This Yugo//Trabant/Pinto To Showroom Condition!!!No!  Let's not!   Nine times out of ten the host is trying way too hard to be a yokel, hyuk hyuk git'er done yee-haw, I am such a character.  This alone is enough to make me want to throw something through the screen.  Or, the host is a characterless lump who is literally and un-ironically, hour after excruciating hour, episode after interminable episode, throwing money at a turd.  And my husband will watch this shit without judgement or complaint.  One of these 'restore a dog' goons is called Scooby.  His big thing is restoring 'hoopties.'  Sounds enticing, doesn't it? Scooby is 85 pounds of I Abuse Coke with this super sad 'STAR' attitude that is just embarrassing, like those guys who had Sunday-only shows on local television and acted like the joint would fall apart without them.  Eeesh. It is tough to watch.  And ol' Scoob doesn't wrench on his 'hoopties' either...his acres and acres and warehouses filled with 'hoopties'.  No, he has a mechanic he calls 'Wizard' who does all the heavy lifting, and he refers to the poor dude as 'Wizard', and then just ponces around talking about his 'hoopties' and pissing me off.  Fuck this dude.  And fuck the idiots who made him YouTube famous too, as long as I'm at it.  Get off my lawn._______________________________ One day, after I had to pull over to the side of the road on my way to Everson to let a big truck pass me because it was a big truck - not too close, driving safely, just a big honkin' truck in my rearview mirror, but it was FREAKIN ME OUT - we here at Rancho FirstNations had A Discussion about the fucking 156,385,638.999,999,000000 car wreck compilation videos.  This discussion helped, but our recent trip to Anacortes is what really put a stake through the heart of that obsession.   Here's what I'm obsessed with staking through the heart. Thanks for ruining the Pacific Northwest, assholes.    It took place right before we  went to Anacortes. We were both nervous for that whole trip.  (Fun fact:  After a steady diet of 285,630,563,8680000 car wrecks, your peripheral vision becomes just as acute as all the rest of your vision, including inner vision, your vision statement, psychological hypervigilance and clairvoyance.) It doesn't help that the traffic to Anacortes on Highway 20 is all huge trucks, nervous swabbies with high performance cars they don't know how to handle, and regular Joes cannoning their way toward the ferry terminal - or the casino, Gawd.  They just can't go fast enough to throw their money away, apparently.  And this describes a completely normal trip, average traffic flow, no accidents, no problem....or it would have described his perception of an average car trip - previous to his having discovered \"Wrecks A' Plenty\" videos.I was kind of sneaky on that trip.  See, I just had a feeling that I wasn't the only one who'd been appalled and frightened by all the images of sudden disaster on the road.  So I angled the rearview mirror on my side so that I could seem to be looking out my window at passing scenery while I was actually watching the Bikers reflection in the back-up bubble-mirror. Stealth optics:  This is was 34 years of marriage leads to.  That man was shitting bricks every time a semi passed us.  He'd flinch.  His grip on the steering wheel was viselike, and tightened whenever a car merged, or changed lanes. By the time we got to our little hotel his shoulders were way up around his ears, and he just dropped his luggage, laid on the bed and stress-breathed for awhile.\"You OK?\" I ask.\" I'm just lying down, geeze.\" (Which I expect.  Mere stress dare not visit such as he.  It is a foreign concept, invented by the weak.) His hands were still in the 'clutching the wheel' position. Me,  I went into the bathroom and listened as he groaned and wheezed trying to make his limbs assume the lying down flat position. I am not too proud to admit that I made 'conducting an orchestra' gestures in the mirror.See, I've heard this composition before.  It's the \"I Must Drive At All Times Requiem\", and it plays after a while spent on the road behind the wheel. Previously it would have taken an all day stint; say,  driving over Snoqualmie Pass, to cue up the orchestra. It was now playing after just a little more than an hour's worth of normal traffic.  Mmm-hm.(Believe me, the \"I Must Drive At All Times Requiem\" beats the Top Ten hit \"Just Checking The Speedometer Constantly and Putting On the Passenger Brakes and Clutching Wildly at Interior Parts While you Make a Slow, Gradual Sweeping Turn\" song, the one that plays while I drive and he fails to passenge correctly.  I finally decided 'Screw it'' and let him do all the driving. He's a bigger road hazard than anything outside the car because he's constantly gasping and panic-reacting and then denying it and pissing me off, which isn't worth me deliberately running high-speed into a bridge support, so I just let him drive - and let him pay the piper.  Because 34 years of marriage, kids.)So here at the Rancho we are blissfully entering the 'Post-498,569,836,986,905,6366665836 car crash compilation' phase of our relationship.  All indications bode well.Next in my sights?  \"Inbred rural dork repairs a Lada using sheetrock nails.\"  Watch this space._______________________________**(but seriously, how many frickin' wood bowls does the world need?  I find these things, once beautiful, high-dollar objects, at garage sales going for a dollar or less these days, all sprung and cracked from from being let to just sit and gather dust near a forced air heater.  If you're going to invest in an $800.00 burlwood bowl, for fucksakes take care of it, otherwise it'll be worth nothing in about five years.  Yeah. No shit.  I see you out there abusing your burlwood burl.)"},

Today, though, every single one of my mental red alerts went off as I was talking to him - and he'd just come from copping - and I mentioned how 'springtime' his outfit was, giving him a friendly grin.  Something about how his face clouded up and he spidered in on himself at that moment was too familiar.  Way too familiar. So, there's that.  Now I'm going to be looking out for him for a completely different reason.  I'll still be friendly (I'm not a mind reader after all) and I'll still make over his dog, but I've got a new attitude.  Christ I hope I'm wrong.  But I don't think so."},
{"title": "The Gift Of Sleazy Pressure-Fried Chicken", "date": "Thursday, March 18, 2021", "text": "Holy shit you guys, I just had my very own Reddit moment!So. The Biker leaves me a coupon and a note this morning.  The coupon is for an eight-piece fried chicken box for $4.00 an order, first two orders.  So this means you can get two 8-piece orders of ck at $4.00 bucks apiece - two orders adding up to $8.00. Am I going to go for that?  Fuck yes I am.Safeway is where we always get our fried chicken, because in the universe of sleazy fried chicken, Safeways' sleazy fried tzikken-birdie reigns supreme.  Their eight-piece mixed box is a treasure chest of crunchy, greasy, salty, chicken flavored Heaven.  No other supermarket deli has anything like the wonderful, sheer pressure-fried awesomeness of Safeway sleazy ass fried chicken.The note that the Biker leaves me says \"Get two orders!\"  And I am all about that, plus I need another bottle of vodka, so off to Safeway I rock, thinking about how awesome it's going to be to have two eight piece orders of sleazy fried chicken to chomp on at whim.  I get to the store, get my order filled at the deli department, pick up a big ol' bottle of cheap vodka (I drink the shit out of a little coffee cup mixed with Sunny D so it's not like I'm going to be spending for Grey Goose - money ahead all the way) and happily go to check out with my big ol' buckets of sleazy fried ck and a economy sized plastic bottle of distilled potato juice.And the coupon is not for Safeway.  I'm in the line.  The dude scans it, and the coupon won't run.Furthermore, my debit card won't run either!!!  This is ten metric  tonnes of doggie squatto's for real.  I am fucked at this point, and I look like a dork.I stood there and tripped tits.  \"Oh my God I am so sorry,\" I say sincerely, embarrassed all to heck. \"I can't see anywhere on the coupon where it says the store name. I just assumed Safeway because we always come here.  My husband left it for me this morning with a note!\" I tell the poor checker.  And then, to make things just awesomely perfect, my goddamn debit card won't run, crap oh Murphy dawg, and the customers are stacking up behind me, and I feel like Mrs. Fuck Off O'Lady for realzes.  I am fully ready to pay full price and I tell the checker this fact.That checkout dude was so sweet and so nice to me about this!  Long story short, he cancelled the sale, re-set the card reader, my card went through and I got both buckets of chicken FOR THE SALE PRICE!And I got the coupon back!So now I have two orders of smoking hot eight piece fried chicken, bishezz! At this very minute, we here at Rancho FirstNations are watching Trailer Park Boys and chomping down on sleazy supermarket deli chicken like demigods, with another untouched 8 pack waiting in the fridge for tomorrow!AND I HAVE A STILL-VALID COUPON FOR TWO 8 PIECE  MIXED BUCKETS FROM ENNENS' MARKET!  Fuck yeah I'm going to use in a couple of days for more sleazy pressure-fried chicken awesomeness!  Even though Ennen's Market has less than optimum sleazy fried chicken, I am willing to make that sacrifice. Why?  Because eight piece fried ck for $4.00 an order, first two orders, kids.  You don't just flick that shit into the round file.  We are gonna be living like Masters of Trash here for the next four days.  Just cheap vodka and fried chicken, man.  Maybe some nudity.  Maybe some small arms use.AMERICA!  FUCK YEAH!Here's the deal though.  Yeah, I got a freebie.  But I didn't go skipping out of the store with my pressure fried prize.  I found a manager and I gave that checker a GLOWING review.  \"He was so polite, and so accommodating, and treated me so respectfully that I'm really grateful, because it was an embarrassing situation and he really made me feel special.  He's awesome and incredibly professional. You got a customer for  life,\" I told the manager.  Made sure to point out the guy.  Made sure to make the manager saw the guy I was talking about.  I'll go online a little later and put it in writing, too.  You don't just take your gift from the universe and run.  You give credit where credit is due.  Particularly in the public service sector, man.  I think everyone reading this knows what a nightmare job working with the public can be.  Glowing customer reviews really mean a lot to employees.  And you have to spread the vibe and send the karma back around. That's what keeps the good vibe rolling. That's what keeps life on Earth from being a thankless nightmare.With ADHD I had to learn this behavior. (Christ knows my parents didn't teach me to treat other people with respect.)  I have a little motto I tell myself; it's an acronym - ENATA.  It stands for ' Effective, Necessary, Accurate, Timely, Appropriate.' It's the way you measure the message that first springs to mind in response to any given conversational gambit, and a way to judge whether or not your response is worth voicing.  Nine times out of ten, my first impulse is...less than optimum.  Unless you let your goddamn dog piss on my Birds' Nest Evergreen.  You will get yelled at for that shit.  I get one half second's worth of time to decide 'should I say/do something?' thanks to Adderal - that's the beauty of Adderal.  You get that one split second that normal people get and think nothing of.  Untreated, an ADHD person just does and says the first dumbass thing that crosses their mind. With Adderal and the 'ENATA' guideline I can keep myself in line during my everyday interactions. I really work at this shit too because I was not a wonderful person in my youth, and I have a lot of karma to set right.  That, and I genuinely want to be a positive note in a less than positive world - this is my revolution. I grew up with people who had damaged and blackened souls, and my soul became damaged and blackened by the contact, and further damaged by the kind of vibe that 'Scarlet Letter' broadcasts about you into the world - water seeks it's own level, like seeks like, yin yearns for yang.  Part of putting a stake through the heart of my awful past means I decide consciously to deliver the most positive response to any given act, and it will suck your soul dry sometimes.  I don't always feel like  being Sister Mary Sunshine. But I have to live in a neighborhood too, in a small town, and so I must work at this shit.I know I bang on about 'Think Globally, Act Locally' and I get preachy.  But it's the only thing that's  made my life mean something.  I didn't find any meaning in religion or politics or anything but in the basic human act of choosing reciprocal survival as a life model.  The Biker and I do our best to keep the flame alive here.But I'm still going to re-use that coupon and get 16 more pieces of sleazy fried chicken for $8.00 bucks."},

Even now, as I glance out my window, I can see it literally steaming away in the cool of the evening.  I have my very own 'Mystical Forest FX/CGI' shit pile.  It's pretty awesome. American Robin Official Harbinger Of Spring Approves Of Steaming Piles Of Shit.  How Do I Know?  American Robin Be All Up On Steaming Pile Of Shit Picking Out Redworms For Baby American Robin Lunch Which Implies Tacit Shit Approval By Robins (American)    I have been slinging shit all over my garden this afternoon.  You'd think I was tossing Mardi Gras necklaces the way everyone flipped me their tits.  Have a New York Slice of bush with those tits, podner!  Which is a lie.  But everyone just had to stop and chat with me all afternoon long.  This says a lot for my neighbors, because I was out there in a \"Fuck Off And Die\" t-shirt, shit crusted barn boots, and absolutely covered in cow ass head to toe.  But everyone had this kind of stoned grin on their faces, like 'Wow, we're all outside, and that big glowing thing is in the sky again!' including me - although a good half of my good mood was having a pile of Mystical Forest FX/CGI shit - and we all kind of rambled on to each other in a super friendly way.  Even Neighborhood Crackhead (who is one of my favorite people) was in on the 'Love Peace Chicken Grease' vibe, talking really kindly and patiently to the little kids gathered around him, petting his dog, being super chill.  To be honest, Neighborhood Crackhead is super chill anyway, and if dudeboy likes to get high, as long as he behaves himself who the fuck am I to judge, as I sit here around an Orange Driver and a rompin' stompin' valium?  The guy is friendly and polite, dresses neatly, and he treats his dog like canine royalty and the dog reflects the man.  That dog is a sweetheart, a friendly and well behaved lil' Staffie love bug who does not cringe, does not jump up or act a fool, and is so incredibly healthy it looks polished.  That little dog loves his dad, and NC sits out in the field with that dog and they have them some conversations sometimes, and play tug, and fetch, and I'm Gonna Gitcha.  I am all for Neighborhood Crackhead.  You go, bud.__________________________________Because my Biker loves me, he bought me a1991 Dodge Dakota V8 longbed.  I love a truck, and a longbed is just right for my needs.  Man it feels good to hop behind the wheel.  I would rather have this truck than I would have a diamond ring.  If my ass had the cash I'd hire a guitar player and rampage.  As it stands, let a girl dream.  It runs perfectly, the wipers and heat work, there's no rust, it's got a bench seat and I can carry a sheet of plywood or a steer or a bunch of coffins or whatever you need carrying. I have no time for a passenger vehicle unless I'm travelling, and even then I'll probably find some bigass thing that I need a truck to carry home anyway.  No I will not help you move._________________________________Dairy Farmer Sent From God, my free shit connection, practically ran to me with open arms when I showed up at his farm this afternoon, because apparently I am a harbinger of Spring.  Harbinger of Spring.  You saw it here first.  We yammered in his driveway for awhile, and then I drove around back of his loafing sheds, where the lagoonage and barn waste stacks are, and just stood out in the sunshine listening to the happy cows make happy cow noises.  He came up in his loader and kind of grinned at me and said \"Smells good?\"\"Yeah.  I like the way a farm smells,\" I said.  He kind of smiled again uncertainly.  He loaded up my truck, and it was when I was backing up, looking in the rearview mirror, that I realized that while we had this conversation I had been standing inches away from a dead calf.Circle of life, folks.  A dead newborn calf goes in the compost because all it is at that stage is jello with hair.  Surprise them at your next the' dansant with this festive treat!  Newborn Calf With Radish Roses and Pimiento Olives!  Ole!  Cha Cha Rama Lang-lang!  Some farmers drag them out and let the eagles have them, but Dairy Farmer Sent From God does not have a convenient thicket to hide the dead calf in (because by law you cannot feed eagles. That's right.  It's ill-eagle to feed wild raptors.  Yes, I said it.) The farms that do have those thickets are outstanding in that they will have up to 75 and upwards bald eagles sitting in the trees waiting for their chance, which attracts the Audubons and the birders to this dot on the map to get out and oo and aw and take pictures by the side of the road.  Little do they know that the reason for this flock behavior is the plentitude of jello-calves in the nearby underbrush every Spring.   Fun farm fact:  a dead newborn calf smells like warm condensed milk!  See what you can learn here at Steve?_______________________________________________Oddly, just as the Orange Thing administration brought the shits and the bigots out of the woodwork, so has the Biden Administration brought out the undercover liberals.  People I'd been saying 'Hi' to for years suddenly unloaded their secret liberal leanings to me today, which made me regain faith in my community. Formerly, under the Orange Regime, I had been disenheartened as people I'd been acquainted with for years suddenly came out with this 'Yay!  We can hate \"__________\" openly now!  Grab my pussy Mr. President!  Fake News!  Gonna plaster my car with Trump stickers!' bullshit, and I was left thinking \"Dear Lord do I even know you?\" and stopped doing business in a couple of places.  It really was this bad.  Never forget, folks. It really was like this.  During all that horseshit, my Biker found an old street sign, a big old reflective yellow and black one for 'Democrat Street' and put it up over the garage, which is where manly men declare their political stances out here in Fuckyersisterville. In addition, he got a 'Biden-Harris' campaign sign and nailed it way up high on the gable of our house so nobody could steal it - and it's still there.  (As if the multiple rotting strings of Buddhist prayer flags on my porch weren't enough to indicate our social stance.) It was his Bull Of The Woods manly repping, out and proud there in a sea of MAGAshittery that made the difference in our little town.  My husband.  Actual photo.  Seriously.So many people told me \"I felt so relieved to see that on you guyses house.\"  And \"I was really getting scared, so thanks for putting that up.\"An old road sign.  Imagine something like that giving people hope.  We're just a couple of chubby people out here in the boonies and people are telling me that the old road sign my husband put up to piss his mark gave them hope.  Imagine that."},
{"title": "DICKED, Bitches!!!", "date": "Saturday, March 13, 2021", "text": "I have got my garden dicked.  Dicked!D, I, C, K - ed, dicked, smashed, under Kon-trol, happenin', chilled, choice, down and done did, Sid! (See above for Sid)  Early Spring power gardening powers activated! All systems go, all plants weeded and beds cleaned! Got my lagoonage connection firmed up for another year of sweet, sweet strained liquid dairy manure solids; kids, it's all going on here on the ornamental vegetation front.So I'm officially in week one of Booze Resumed.  This amounts to two Orange Drivers an evening, which are enough to render me a sniggering, guffawing wreck while watching 'Redneck Fails' on YouTube.  I've loosened up considerably, is what I'm saying.  I really think I needed to loosen up, too.  Read on.The reason I keep coming back to this subject, I think, is that this past Winter was such a motherfucker.  I worried that hell, come Spring, I'd be all broken and frail and shit, the way I remember all the older people being when I was a kid.  That all the stress and isolation would eat me away and I'd emerge in the Spring wihered, tremulous and vague, barely able to manouver a walker (Zimmer Frame to you Brits.)  The thing is, all the older people I knew when I was a kid were straight off the boat from the Olde Country, had suffered wars, famines, plagues,  poor nutrition and health care at the best of times ( not to mention the literal feudal conditions my dads' folks came from in Finland - my grandfather literally had to run away under cover of darkness because the landowner wouldn't give him permission to leave his estate!  He had the police on his heels until the ship left dock!)  My formative, first memories of old people are of little, tiny, bent frail people who used two canes to walk, who had swollen and bent fingers, who were all but blind and usually deaf as posts;  who would yatter in foreign languages and drink coffee out of saucers.  They all wore black and they all looked like miniature Ents, gnarled and sickly.  And just about all of them dipped snuss or smoked for some reason, male and female.  So that was my first impression of what being 60 was like - you shrunk up until you were about 60 lbs of 'No English', toothless, smelling like mothballs, salted liquorice and horehound drops, with fingers so knotted and bent with arthritis that you had to have someone else mince your food for you.  The first thing you did was break a hip.  It's just how it was.  They were always covered in horrifying skin conditions or strange varicose relief maps.  The women had thin, cotton candy wisps of hair and the men had long, long, long beards and moustaches stained yellow around their mouths.Now I'm not going to be posing for coture swimwear anytime soon.  But I'm so far from the above descriptions that it's kind of a strange culture shock effect.  I expected sixty to be horrible.  I expected to have had my first heart attack and my first stroke long since now.  I'd always figured that by sixty all I'd be good for was sitting out on the porch shouting at passing cars, like my elderly second cousin Leota, who had dementia, and who was kept in check with a bottle of whiskey and a gate on her front porch steps so she couldn't wander out into traffic.  This is what was done in those days, and cousin Leota was happy enough, drunk as shit, sitting on her porch waving at cars, dogs and passers-by, swigging out of her bottle.  I thought that would be me.Me, I'm out in my Bill Nye t-shirt slinging topsoil and operating power tools. I can speak passable English, and I only wear black because it's metal.  I'm still 5 ft. 5 inches.  I'll shout at traffic, but it's usually \"SLOW THE FUCK DOWN COCKSUCKER\" and not \"HELLOOOOO SUGAR BABY!\" like cousin Leota, who was cheerful and nutty.  I am able to maintain a reasonably passable semblance of normality and I'm only cheerful when I feel like being cheerful Goddammit, not because my synapses have turned into mush.  Hell, I don't even pee myself.  WINNING._____________________________________I had the cutest thing happen today.  The little neighbor boy asked me \"Do you have water?\"\"I sure do,\" I said cheerfully.\"But do you have octopusses?\" he asked.\"No I don't, just regular water.  But I wish I had octopusses, that would be cool,\" I replied.\"DAVID, COME HERE NOW,\" shouted his mother, at this point. I don't know if it was the octopus discussion or what, but you could hear the cautionary tone in the womans' voice.  Tell you what, I'd rather talk about octopusses with a six-year-old than exchange polite banter with an adult any day of the week. If she thought I would be off-put, she was mistaken.  I will talk about octopusses all day long.  And now the poor kid thinks that he can't talk about octopusses with the elderly.  Does that suck or what?  Shit, when I was little, old people would talk to you about all kinds of nutty stuff, and that was fine with everyone. They'd teach you dirty words in Swedish and tell you weird stories about The Wompus Cat.  I learned the lyrics to 'Down In Da Meddo In Da Iddy Biddy Poo' from a random old person.  How the hell are we supposed to pass on our legacy of demented shit if sniffy mommies in yoga pants keep cock-blocking our efforts to weirdify the young?  They're all going to grow up with no imaginations whatsoever.  Their souls will be fossilized by Minecraft and porn.  I for one intend to fight this trend.  If you ever come back around, little random boy with a green airplane toy, I will talk to you about octopusses! And hey,  let me tell you about a special octopus, a real crazy octopus guy named C'thulhu!  He is just like Davy Jones in the Disney Movie, only he can make you insane just by looking at him!  He's going to bring about the end of the world! Now go home and spread that tale around to all your little friends!  N'ghai!"},

I suck and am uncool. I've also lost 50 lbs and gained a 6-pack, kids, so when you call me Granny, SMILE MOTHERFUCKER.I had an iffy week after I stopped drinking, I won't lie.  Around about 4 in the afternoon I'd begin thinking about a Bloody Maria or a Vodka Driver, or a Lagunitas 'Lil Sumpin Sumpin' or six.  I'd have to write it out furiously, or go online and find a substitute habit, like Reddit topics or true ghost stories.  I did a lot of pacing and drinking water.  But after that week passed, my body shook off the physical jones and I spent the next week sweating all the precursor out - the fat-stored 'welcome, booze!' chemicals - which was nasty as fuck and stunk.  That right there was enough to buck up my willpower, because there is nothing nastier than ex-booze stank.  It just cascades out of your system and taints all your bodily products.  I had to Febreeze my hat, coat and shoes for a week just so I wouldn't be simmering in my raunch or inflicting it on others.  It may have been in my head, but I wasn't going to take a chance.TMI? Nah, I know you degenerates.  And hey -  anybody out there who has given up a chemical habit knows I'm telling the Gods' honest truth.  And if you'd care to chime in with your own tales of 'I gave up _________' feel free.  I'd be super interested to hear your experiences!Oddly, once I quit drinking I suddenly thought 'damn, I'd like a cigarette.'  (Not vape, although I am all for vaping. I've tried it and I really enjoyed it.  Particularly the awesome, massive clouds of cold smoke you exhale.  That really pleased the six year old child of Satan in me.)  No, I wanted a cigarette, and the whole ritual that goes along with smoking.  The tamping of the pack, the shaking out of the smoke, cracking the lighter, that first excellent hit that goes right to that sweet spot right behind your sternum and puts the world right for a moment, and then the exhale.  Holding the cigarette between  my fingers.  The smell of the unsmoked pack, the tobacco and the paper and the foil.  The smell of the butane.  Holding the lighter in my hand.  Flicking my hair back as I lit up.  Even that rich couple of coughs midway through that first cigarette of the day. When you are a smoker, smoking punctuates your day - after a meal.  When the phone rings.  During a break.  After a task.  At a tavern or a bar - I mean, walk in the door and light up (I'm really old and this was pretty much what everyone who smoked did.  You walked in, took off your coat and lit up a smoke before you ordered.  It was just that way.)  With a beer.  As soon as you got into a car.  As soon as you hit the bus stop. As soon as you got off a bus.  Like that.And see, that's what makes smoking cigarettes so hard to say goodbye to.  There's so many different habits going on.  So many little routines.  It pervades your life.  I FOUGHT for years to quit, and once I did, I knew that I couldn't play around with cigarettes again. So I said 'fuck no' to that impulse. Meanwhile, I like a cigar with a shot of Bushmills (thank you, MITM!) because there is nothing as fine as the play of a quality cigar combined with a good whiskey.  It puts you in touch with your heart chakra.  But that is a very, very special and specific treat (thank you, MITM!) that I only indulge in a couple of times during the Fall of the year, period, full stop.Here's the deal.  I'm thinking about starting drinking again.I've had a couple of drinks lately.  Once in Anacortes, and one the other day.  And it was good. It put the cap on the day and smoothed out my vibe. I realized 'Damn, this is what's been missing. This cherry on top of the day.' I decided to try full-on waterwagon abstinence, and it was a thing. I was happy. I can flourish and create.  But I also like a buzz.  I've always been into the recreational buzz - chemical, dust, smoke.  I don't do the others any more, but alcohol is a known quantity, one I can navigate, manage, and one I enjoy.  The buzz is a treat.  And I really missed it, come to realize.  So I'm going to start drinking again.DISCUSS."},

Just not having The Orange Thing in office is a load off.  I may even start watching the news again. Not feeling ashamed and embarrassed about who's in charge of my country - and that's such an odd thing to be stressed about, but I really was.  I guess I never realized how deep my patriotism ran until someone pissed all over it.  But the best thing by far has been getting outside and working in my garden again. The exercises I've been doing REALLY paid off.  I'm able to put in a solid day outside and not stumble in wrecked as I have been every Spring for years - that first week is a killer.  Not this year! Nope!  This year I just crack off a hundred crunches because I'm badass like that, do my weights and stretches and go forth.  I have hacked and I have slashed.  I have whacked weeds and raked twigs.  I have pruned; lo, I have brought the blade unto mine elm and unto my magnolia also did I bring sharp steel, and their limbs fell, and I have brought them unto the place of gathering whereof limbs of old are piled and did pile them.No complaints here.

Found it busted open this morning with half the cookies gone.  Aha.  So I quickly snagged a few packages and hid them in my room, because I am six, and Girl Scout cookies.  About $80.00 worth of fucking Girl Scout Cookies.  My God.  Did I eat an entire package of Samoas?  Yes.____________________We are bingeing on Peaky Blinders and DAMN it's good.  Season One could have stood by itself, perfect ending, great place to stop if you don't want to get hooked.  I did because it has the best fucking soundtrack, of all things!  If you haven't seen it, it's about a 1920's gangster family in Birmingham UK.  Super violent, super bloody, excellent story.  Season Two, it's getting kind of Godfather-ish...the creeping rot, the decline and fall of a criminal empire kind of thing.  Still good, but I see myself bailing pretty soon.  The only thing marring Season 2 is all the fucking PJ Harvey songs.  GAAAAAAAH PJ Harvey.  I hate that pukey hipster girl singing and the deliberately awkward lyrics, like Alanis Morissette.  But I can still forgive them that because of all the Nic Cave, White Stripes, Raconteurs, Arctic Monkeys, The Kills, Royal Blood and so forth.  Super dynamic tunes backing the action, and not at all what you'd expect, but the mood matches perfectly.______________________I have to remember to get my second part of the shingles vaccine. I'm due this month.  After seeing what so many of the elderly in my life have gone through, the terrible pain; and just from having chicken pox in your youth?  Hell, I caught it four different times!  No way I'm NOT going to get that taken care of.  If you haven't already, do it soon.  it's such an easy thing to do and it spares you absolute agony - go. Now.  I mean it."},
{"title": "WARTHOG FAMILY SOJOURN 2021", "date": "Sunday, February 28, 2021", "text": "Hello fellow submarine racers!  I may have never told you this, but our family crest bears the image of the noble WARTHOG.  We are the Warthog Family, warting our hoggy way around the obscure and wonderful places in Western America since 1986 and often leaving graffiti in our wake to mark our progress, which is childish, destructive, and antisocial.  Like warthogs.The Mighty Warthog Will Find All That Is Funky And Dig All Which Is Diggable________________________________________Imagine that you are in your favorite place.  That’s where  I am now.  Anacortes, Washington.The motel where we are staying is as good as any out there, for 1500.00 a night less than we used to pay.  And so we contribute to a privately owned, local business run by people we really like, that has the same linens and decor as the $$$$$ place we used to visit, and we feel all smug and shit about how we really commit to that whole Thinking Globally and Acting Locally thingaroo.  Or acting out locally, which will inevitably occur after our third high-test craft beer.We used to stay in the most deluxe accommodations in town. It was absolutely wonderful, please, don’t get me wrong. The Majestic, Anacortes Washington.  I mean, GO THERE NOW.  Views unparalleled.  Amenities galore.  Beautiful historic building - check.  Fine dining? Room service? Gym? Spa? Tours? Excellent staff?  Check. One of the finest accommodations on the West Coast, check checkity check.  We spent vacations, Thanksgiving and Christmas at this inn for years, and mooned out over the waters of Puget Sound by day and did the wild thang out on the balcony at night, and lolled in their Lucullan bathrooms like chubby warthog gods.  And that was nice, but no matter where we stayed, what we loved was Anacortes.  We are intrepid explorer warthogs, not gym-rat, spa-loving warthogs, and while balcony sex is great, they were not Warthog sized balconies.  And so we made our move.Anacortes is genuinely worth loving.  The neighborhoods, the people, the shops, the food, the amazing byways and particularly all the freaky, amazing places big and small, some charmless and some sugar sweet with sprinkles, all left in time out in the nearby hills. Old resorts from the 1920’s, tumbledown logger-baron mansions that have ghosts dripping out of the windows, stretches of windblown madrona and ancient juniper sheeted like flames blown back against the granite headlands that spear up from the water, hidden beaches and parks, eccentric public art and private homes... and hands down THE BEST FARMERS MARKET I’VE EVER VISITED.  I mean a no bullshit, non-hipster, A-1 farmers market with real farmers marketing their locally grown vegetables, meats and cheeses, honey, eggs, cured meats, fish...you GOTTA visit.  I mean it.  You’re my Elect.  My most trusted minions.  Skagit county is a miracle, but Anacortes is the crown of the region.It’s a small part of the Western U.S. that few people have heard of ( and don’t spread it around, kids.  It’s our secret.)  There are untouched, pristine biomes here! I mean, my God, the ENVIRONMENT, folks.  Don’t come here expecting Oregon’s Disneyesque color saturation, the lush growth, the soft-focus sunshine and gentle mosses and ferns through which trip clueless fawns and sassy bunnies and birdies in kerchiefs.  This is more boreal, more dramatic, wilder, Game of Thrones stuff.  And it's right there.  All around you.Anacortes is a historical working town dropped into the middle of tidal flats alive with uncounted birds, marine life and sea-flora, sudden cliffs, vast fucking evergreens too clawed into the steep hillsides to ever log, Pacific madronas with smooth red bark like satin and broad green leaves like laurels; always shining like they’re polished, and cove after cove of small hidden beaches and parks and places to swim (clothed and nekkid.)  In fact the graveled coves are rubbing places for killer whales, who will beach themselves in the wash of the waves just to exfoliate their bellies on the rocks.  They look like big puppies playing as they wriggle around and roll back into the water, clearly having the time of their lives as they tumble into each other.  Wow, right? Fuck yes, wow!Killer whales know how to party, and are arguably the most particular sea mammals when it comes to skin care.  Plus they chomp baby seals.  J.R.R. Tolkein didn’t have a goddamn CLUE.  Someone should have told him about this place, the San Juan Archipelago, the eerie grace of the rainfall as it sweeps down from the clouds in twisting arcs among the islands, the flights of thousands of birds just over the tops of the waves, all lifting like a single living sheet of shadow into the sky before the bow of your boat.  This is the land of bold ravens, wolves and bears and cougar, eagles and every kind of bird of prey; sea birds and water birds in wild profusion, where deer walk the streets of downtown, where the casinos rake in the cash, where the refinery takes care of what the Alaskan pipeline puts out, where the traffic is part log trucks and part supercars, an international freight and passenger gateway to Canada, Russia and the Orient.  Cultural cross-pollination has been good to Anacortes.  It makes the place attractive to just about anybody. Live and let live is the rule.  It’s home to all the retired bigwigs from nearby Whidbey Island Naval Air Base, big petrochem, college professors, Burners, Wiccans, truck drivers, and Microsoft geniuses.  There is a huge population of farmers, native fishermen, and the people who work in the tulip fields that provide flower bulbs for the world, even more than Holland.  It was home to a pioneer ‘Free Love’ commune (Imagine all those grim people in the daguerreotypes sans clothes, joyously hippity hopping through the mud celebrating their right to dangle!) Nearby is a branch of the famed Ramtha cult.  Bow Edison a couple of miles away hosts at least five organic farming communes, all flourishing, cheek by jowl with gnarly old loggers, internationally known artists, general rich as fuck people, The Banditos MC, and the largest Mexican population in the state. It is also the center of the Coastal Salish Nation and a party destination for the swabbies.  This is the most multicultural town I’ve ever visited._________________________________________The town of Anacortes is the unofficial Victorian capitol of Skagit and Island counties. It is weird and wonderful.  The geology supports xeri, temperate and boreal plants.  You’ll see barrel cactus, palm trees, tundra willow and Douglas firs side by side.  The geology changes by the mile.  Ancient granite meets basalt meets sedimentary deposits carrying different fossil aeons.  The inhabitants date from the pre-Ainu Pacifia dispersal adventurers, who set up their longhouse palaces and then met and embraced the latter-day Celtic expansion to boldly screw and damn the torpedoes. They just took a long, primordial look at one another and said “We must do the Bossa Nova!!”  (I am related in a small way to the Salish Nation, and they kick ass. As you would expect.)My room looks out on an alley- not the cement nightmare of most cities, but a back byway for service vehicles. There is laurel growing in huge swathes, verdant in the last days of Winter.  I can see the old downtown from here.  An old theatre, with its shameful uppermost balcony still giving testimony to how we used to divide ourselves into better and worse - and failed.  I can see the gardens of private homes, and parts of a few  of the main roads, and finally Puget Sound. We are three blocks away from a park that was designed in homage to Gaudi- which is weird as fuck. I meant; they did,  and I’m grateful, because it’s funky as shit and right in the center of town.  And town itself is a modest commercial strip surrounded by houses from every decade since the place was started.  Things are jumbled together here, which I love.  They still use the pioneer shipyards and warehouses, storefronts and homes.  There are sleek modernist mansions next to old Victorian cathouses.  There is A LOT of money here in Anacortes, but it’s a working town, not a quaint historical district, and that’s what we love best about it.  We are also a  mile away from a vast Catholic cemetery where years ago the nuns and priests buried the young Native girls and their illegitimate infants in numbered blocks, hidden away by overgrown trees and grass, the Girls Home now gone, and that kind of shit driven out by the Salish Nation for good.  The best bakery in the state is in Anacortes - 'Store Bakery' is it's name, weirdly, but it's their bakery, and with baked goods as excellent as theirs they can call it whatever the fuck they want.You will eventually run into Puget Sound in Anacortes.  It’s connected by a thin strip of land and a couple of two-lane bridges to Whidbey Island, so think of it as a kind of spur starting out from the flats and fields of the mainland out into the long, wide fjord that cuts down through Washington state from the north.  There are islands everywhere, some tiny, some private, some huge, and most of them connected by a ferry system which is counted as federal highway.There isn’t much traffic in this year of our lord  Covid 2021. But the business district is busy, and all the restaurants have turned the parking places on the main street into covered and heated outdoor dining areas, which is the most forward thinking thing I’ve seen - and people are out there in the rain and cold, partying it up!  Not old farts like me who get to sit inside, but still. So here's the scoop.  We took advantage of our states’ declaring ‘Stage 2’ to get out of fucking MAGA Sumas and hit our favorite town, and to eat at our  favorite hangout, and drink their limited-run Scotch Ale (probably not a real thing on the world stage but we love it) and eat their wonderful food and explore their wonderful town.  We are staying nearby in our favorite privately-owned lodgings in our favorite town, loving the fact that no  matter where we go, we will be accepted and greeted no matter how we present ourselves.  Anacortes has always welcomed our Warthog nature.Rock the fuck on, Anacortes. We love you."},

Plus I am the official Worlds' Biggest Coward when it comes to pain, anything remotely medical, and Republicans.  I am pleased and relieved to say that I sat completely at my ease, watching HGTV while unspeakable things were done to my teeth and I had not a care in the world.  Honestly, it was like a spa day.  I NEVER thought I'd be saying that about a trip to the dentist!In case I have any local lurkers, the place is called Everson Family Dentistry.  Jodi was my saintly hygenist, and Dr. whatever his name was was quick, friendly, efficient and did not have fingers like sausages.  If I'm going to have something in my mouth...well, there's a time and a place for everything, let's say.  This guy had little thin fingers like a pianist, and it was nice for a change, because most dentists have fingers like kielbasas, or professional bowlers. Or bananas.  I was awake, I was able to drive myself home, and there will be no YouTube videos of me slurring stupid shit in the aftermath of being drugged (sadly.  I know you were all looking forward to that.)I'm home now, the novacaine is wearing off, I've take a few aspirin and a couple of Valium and I'm doing just great.  I won't be operating heavy machinery, deciding the fate of nations, or signing any legal documents, but I didn't have that planned for today anyway.  I'll decide the fate of nations tomorrow, as normally scheduled.  Expect a regime change coming to your neighborhood soon!"},

Rushmore was carved by a dugong.  David  Green, noted mountain-carving dugong of note totally did that shit.  That's right.  We would not have a Mt. Rushmore if it were not for one proud and talented dugong, a visionary with a jackhammer and the severed heads of four presidents.Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln.  First in the stone of the moutains, first in the hearts of their whatever.  Dugongs. Jonas Salk, who freed millions from the scourge of syphillis was also a dugong.  He didn't even take out a patent for his discovery.  He could have made $483650626.00, but he was a visionary and a true philanthropist who was only interested in eating crud off the bottom of ponds.  How many of us can say the same?Is anything related?  Is the moon made of green cheese?  Am I suffering from cabin fever?  Is 'dugong' more fun to say than 'manatee'?  The answer, my friends, is blowin' in the wind.You should go out right now and invite a boatload of dugongs into your home.  Their needs are simple and the benefits are long lasting.  You will have dugongs.  And isn't that what life is all about?There! You now have more Serene Sea Flubbos than you did when you first started reading this, and your life is better.  See how that works?__________________________I actually got outside AND DID GARDENING ACTIVITIES yesterday!  I actually got outside, in a t-shirt and yoga pants, and stood in my own yard, outside of the house!  I used secateurs!  And a rake!  I MOWED THE YARD!!!!  Good God it's the first time I've felt like a human being in literal months!!  The sun was shining, but the ground was still frozen solid, so I was able to go out on the rider and scalp it right down to the root so it will come up super green and thick when it finally decides to be Spring!  And guess what?  I RAKED OUT THE BEDS IN THE BACK YARD.  Yes.  I totally did that thing.  And I trimmed off some rose canes, and cut back my buddleia, and it was AWESOME!!!!!!!________________________________Another \"It happened here\" picture.  Remember the fictionalized version of how I ended up back in my hometown after I left my abusive boyfriend, and I ended up living in a garden shed?  Remember the house that was being remodeled in that story, the one that 'Aunt Audie' lived in?  Here it is, thanks once again to Google Maps street view:When I last saw this place it was canary yellow with bright apple red trim, like a Chinese restaurant.  This paint scheme was totally cooked up by me, Mike and Big Jim, because Mr. Fields said that he didn't care what color it was painted as long as it got painted.  Well then!  (It's also why all the closets in the place were painted red, white and blue on the inside.  I did that.)  I can understand why our brilliance was not understood by the present residents, though.  Such splendor isn't for everybody."},
{"title": "Cold Snap", "date": "Tuesday, February 16, 2021", "text": "We finally got over a terrible cold snap here - high winds straight from the Arctic Circle blasting past my poor little house, temperatures down around 19F., just miserable; and despite our best efforts, the supply lines to our washing machine froze.  Luckily, only for a day, but still.This is what happens when you live in an uninsulated house.  Well, a partially uninsulated house.  Well, a conglomeration of strange additions and subtractions that might be insulated or might be a howling hole full of ice giants and fear.My poor bathroom was stuck onto the back of the house by someone unconstrained by modern building codes sometime back in the 1920's, and is three sides to the wind, facing Northwest, from whence all the evils of winter do come.  In a high wind it creaks and groans and snaps like a wooden boat, which is alarming, and the wind going down the sump ventilation pipe makes the water in the toilet bloop and blurble, which is also alarming but also hilarious.  The same benighted soul who put in the bathroom also decided that it would be an excellent idea to put all the plumbing into the Northeast walls of the house, so from late November to February we have the water trickling from the kitchen tap, the bathroom tap, and the tub spout.  This business about 'only keep the water running out of the the source furthest from the service attachment' does not hold true here, as we have found after years of experience - and last years Plumbing Explosion/Rat Chewing Extravaganza, when  the pipes under the house burst AND a rodent chewed the plastic pipe that runs from the main line to the hot water heater, which, why?  This year we were lucky.  The cold winds only lasted for eight days, and only for a couple of days were they battering my poor little house in gale-force gusts.  The majority of the time, they were just a constant.  But that constant literally freeze-dried all the exposed bits of earth around here and kicked up enormous tall dust ghosts, which was an odd sight as they seem to literally walk across the fields, twenty feet tall, on long spindly legs that trail rags and swaths of grey.  It's hypnotic to watch, and also disturbing.  I'm beginning to understand why people move to Phoenix when they get old.  Of course, I'd bitch about that too once I was there.___________________________We have been maxing out on historical documentaries here at Rancho FirstNations, chief among them 'Timeline' and 'Absolute History.'  I am once again moved to wonder how anyone manages to complete a building project in the UK as it seems like whenever someone sticks a shovel in the ground they hit a Roman whorehouse or a king or a mass plague burial or some shit.  But God bless y'all, you do history RIGHT.  Nothing is outside the scope of your studies, and specialists range from Roman  Era Deviant Grave Depositions to Edwardian Sanitation Experts.  Half of you are archeologists and the other half are living in re-enactment settlements in the Midlands, I swear, but it's all fantastic stuff!  You find a Viking hoard full of diamond dildoes and gold spittoons, you display that behind bulletproof glass! You happen across a fossilized turd, then you get in there and examine the hell out of that turd!  And that turd reveals it's turdly secrets and the historical record is immeasurably richer for it's turdular testimony.  You find evidence of headhunting, scalp taking and cannibalism?  You just lay it all out there, nothing loth.We don't have that same strong spirit of inquiry here in the Northwest.  The fact that our ancient history isn't ours has a lot to do with that.  The other thing is that our more recent history is so recent that it was hardly recorded, and where it was recorded, it was done so in a perfunctory manner with little thought for the vagaries of drunks and clumsy persons who used fire indoors.  You guys had stone buildings to keep your records in; we pioneers only had wood for the most part.  My little dot on the map lost the first 50 years of it's settlement history to a fire that swept through.  (My front room, once a one-room cabin, escaped that fire by a hair; I've seen an old photo and it's amazing.)  The only way we even know who owned what is because the Canadians had, yup, records - kept in stone buildings - that the survivors could consult.I've found a few artifacts here during gardening.  I have a couple of old medicine bottles,  a porcelain dolls' arm, and a stone hide scraper. Lots of hand-forged nails, so many that I've piled them in my perennial herb bed.  Our poor little town museum is kind of lost in time around the 1920's - anything earlier is a loan from one of the nearby towns that no longer exist.  And that's sad.  I've donated a few things I've found going through old barns nearby, and to see them on display makes me feel that nice tingle of civic pride.  No fossilized turds yet, but I keep the flame of hope alive.  Fingers crossed.  Someday."},
{"title": "Dentists and UFOs", "date": "Wednesday, February 10, 2021", "text": "The best way to get something done is to DO IT.  Had I taken my own advice I would not have the dental issues I have now, and I would not be scrambling to get them taken care of.  In my defense I must say that I've had some seriously shitty dentists in the past.  I won't even go into it.  Cap that experience (you see what I did there) with getting all four wisdom teeth taken out at once - and then getting 'dry socket' on all four craters! and yeah, I haven't been back for a few years.I can date this specifically to July 4th of 2016, the date of The Ultimate White Trash 4th of July Celebration up in the foothills of Washington, in a tiny little town that doesn't show up on maps, where we rode on our Harley, and  1. taught small children to use firearms  2. used firearms ourselves, badly, 3. while drunk 4. set off many illegal fireworks 5. while drunk 6. set a sofa on fire, and a pool table,  7. while very drunk 8. drove up and down the street blasting funk and disco music while everyone else partied up on the logging stages all around us 9. while profoundly drunk 10. and I broke an incisor; which I then pulled myself, using a needlenosed pliers, 11. while SOBER.The broken tooth happened right after I arrived at the party, and I proceeded to make my pioneer forbears proud.  Screw that tooth.  After all the kids had marvelled at it, I threw it into the brush and drank a bunch of vodka. That's how much I hate the dentist.I realize that it's my time; that women my age lose their back teeth and that losing your teeth when you're old happens, but it doesn't mean I have to like it.  This doctor specializes in dental-phobic patients, though, and I'm counting on that.  I will not be dignified and I will not put on a brave showing.  I will wince and freak and possibly cry.  BEFORE the dentist does anything.  This is my way of welcoming a new medical specialist onto my team.  Kind of like their initiation.  And after all, I have good insurance, and times are tough.  They'd BETTER treat me well.  At least, that's the kind of attitude I'm trying to encourage in myself.______________________________________Now look at this picture.   This is a picture of the very spot, including the arrow, of the place where my mother was standing when she saw her FIRST flying saucer.  (There were more, believe me.)  Imagine my chubby little mom standing right on that arrow, looking off to the left, up by the bar with the traffic lights on it, watching A Visitor From Space!    Imagine a real music hall yiddishe mama voice, and you'll have my mothers voice, although she was a New York Cat'lick.  \"Aouw my gaaawd, theah it was!  An' I was just standin' theah right by the grass!  An I just looked up!  Right theah, and it was, oh it was hyuge and red and cigah shaped, kind of, oh, and people was just loooookin and looookin, and we all just loooooked...\" and this would go on awhile.  Now this was back in her 'mystical' days, before she had her conversion experience, burned her Ouija Board and all her astrological books and got Jesus the way a racoon gets hit by a truck.  She would trot this story out to anyone who mentioned the subject, and since it was quite a subject around 1968, my mother became, unbeknownst to her, one of the 'cool' moms in the neighborhood because she would not shut her yap about this goddamn flying saucer.  Or cigar.  I was just going through Google maps, travelling around, and I thought it was really poignant that the arrow and the corner just lined up so perfectly, and that the picture itself could be anyplace in America, any anonymous corner, except for the fact that in 1968, my mother saw a U.F.O as she stood on that very spot!  Remember that the next time you're abducted.  Drop the name 'Helen Hartis' and maybe you'll get to skip that butt probe!  Unless you were looking forward to the butt probe.  I don't judge."},
{"title": "My Ongoing Hatred Of Coyotes", "date": "Monday, February 8, 2021", "text": "I was sitting here enjoying the storm last night, the wind blowing, the rain hitting the windows, my music playing low, when out of the night, from right across the street, starts up what sounded like 25 coyotes all giving voice.  I about pissed myself.\"Aw, I think they sound beautiful,\" people say.  Not to me, but people say it.  And they are usually people who don't live where they have to worry about coyotes.  I LIVE WHERE YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT COYOTES.  They will come right into your yard, or farm, or barn, and steal your animals and dig in your trash and climb up on things and tear shit up.  Hell, I have to worry about eagles and other birds of prey here. I even have to worry about bears, and I even have to worry about wild ducks tearing up my yard during the winter.  Do you have to worry about ducks?  No you do not.  So shut up about how beautiful coyotes sound, because they don't sound beautiful.  They sound like the souls of the damned.  The insane damned.  One coyote sounds like five, and five sound like twenty five, and that's just too goddamned many coyotes, particularly at ten at night in the middle of a storm when most reasonable animals are in bed watching Netflix. Animals are just beginning to come out of hibernation, and there's really nothing out there to eat yet.  The coyotes are hungry.  When they're right in town like this, during bad weather, in their numbers, they're looking for 1. Your dog Spot  2. Your cat Princess Puff-Puff  3. First graders.  4. February calves.It's the February calves that they're really counting on, and they'll take a few this year.  Last fall when the coyotes were out partying they weren't thinking about next February because they're coyotes.  Now there's a bunch of youngsters, and coyote dad is whining 'the condom broke, geeze' and mom coyote is just disgusted, and they have to feed their unplanned offspring.  The guy two fields down raises dairy stock, and he's going to get hit hard.  It's just beginning.A coyote is fox-smart and dog-cowardly.  They are nimble and they can climb, too.  In packs they are a force to be reckoned with.  When they have intermingled over the years with dog stock, and these have, they are no damn joke.  They'll blitz the loafing sheds like a ninja attack.  And that's what freaks me out about coyotes.  They've always been on the outskirts, and they've always been hit and run scavengers.  Mankind didn't take in coyotes and tame them into dogs.  They took wolves.  Our ancestors were not stupid people.  A wolf is intelligent, and it's able to adapt.  A coyote has a different nature.  It was made for a specific ecological niche, and it's been very successful in that niche, and has no interest in adapting.  It's why humans tamed horses and not zebras.  A horse is intelligent and can adapt.  A zebra is just a stripey, pissed off animal with a shitty attitude that occupies a specific ecological niche, and has a passing resemblance to horses, but will chew on your face and stomp you to death because it's a zebra and does not want to adapt so fuck off.The good thing about zebras is that they don't hunt in packs at night during rainstorms and howl like demented souls from Hades right outside my goddamn front window.  They have the sense to live in Africa.  Coyotes do not.  They live all up in my grille, and they have since I was a kid, because this is the Pacific Northwest, and we have wild animals all over the fucking place here.  When I lived in the suburbs we had coyotes, and when I lived in Portland we had coyotes in Portland; Seattle has coyotes and I know that for a damn fact because I saw a bunch of them one night crossing the park up on Capitol Hill.  They do not give a fuck. They are the reason that you do not put your cat outside at night here.  Or your first grader.  Never do that here. Coyotes will eat them.When I was in grade school we had friends who lived way out in the country, and they had two girls; my parents used to like to dump me off with them for a week every now and then.  One night we were all sleeping in the downstairs corner bedroom, a room with large windows, almost floor to ceiling.  As we were going to sleep, we heard the coyotes start up out in the hills, and that was fine.  Until they started getting closer and closer, and adding members to the choir, and then came up and were just within the light limit of the house - we could peek out the drapes and see their eyeshine. No, it was when they started SCRATCHING ON THE SIDING OF THE HOUSE that I began to get alarmed.  And the things are still yattering and screeching and howling, remember!  Mr. Farm Dude and his wife were no help.  They did not care.  Not in the least bit bothered.  Us kids are screaming, and they're just yelling at us to shut up and go to sleep, while just inches away there is a pack of wild animals scratching on the house trying to get in to where we three little girls were sleeping!  That is not a recipe for a good night's sleep.  That is the way you learn that 'Clearly, we're the disposable members of this group.'So remember that the next time you go mooning on about the romance of the Old West.  That shit is imaginary.  It wasn't Dale Evans and Roy Rogers.  It was gonorrhea, whores and coyotes."},

No more problem.  It was pretty basic stuff, but now I'm stuck with him in the house for about two weeks.  I mean I'm happy he won't put himself through what his father, The Playboy Of The Western World, put himself through by being an Old German Dude who is made of cast iron and scorns the work of medical science because he is an ubermensch.  My Biker was responsible and did the right thing, and I'm glad.Now, he used to have that Old German Dude mindset, and some of you will recall the bullshit I used to go through trying to get this man to take care of himself.  What had to happen, finally, was me telling him \"All I can be responsible for is me.  I will no longer bother you, your health is entirely up to you.\" (Now for my part, sticking to that resolution was a biiiiiiiiiiiitch, because for me not to nag is not normal behavior.  I was born to kvetch.  You got a problem?  I have the solution and you're gonna hear about it at length until you get  that problem taken care of because I know best.  As you all know.  Which should go without saying actually.)  So that's what happened.  And it came to the point where he made a bad decision, and now has to live with the results of that bad decision staring him in the face for the rest of his life, because he was too fuckin' metal to do his physical therapy.  (Am I gloating?  Yes.  Yes I am.  I am a terrible person. Which should also go without saying.)  And he learned from that mistake, because that's kind of a big deal, and so he gradually came around to admitting - at least to himself - that he is not 16 and bulletproof.   Was I relieved? YES LORD.Now we can have discussions that admit to the fact that we are aging.  It's no longer a touchy ass subject, and believe me, it used to be.  And it's a relief for both of us.  If your health and appearance are a matter of pride, no matter who you are, you are going to get older, and that pride is going to turn into your worst enemy if you don't amend your reality.  Your body is going to change.  You will go through reverse puberty, people. Your ass hair will fall out and turn grey and, just, shit will happen.  Embrace those changes, people.  SNAP THE FUCK OUT OF IT AND GET OVER YOURSELF.Meet your new boyfriend.  Now try and live up to THAT foxy.     You're living in a body made of meat and meat by-products.  You have a limited shelf life.  Make the changes you can to keep what you have left comfortable, clean and functioning, and live in your new body like a reasonable person instead of an irritating old idiot who drives everybody crazy with their easily-avoided health issues, denial and bitching. Nobody thinks you're brave and nobody admires you.  What they are is put upon and taken out of their own lives by your continuing to be a stone in their shoe! GET WITH THE FUCKING PROGRAM!Whew, I feel so much better now!  I needed to nag somebody!  Thank you for being there, my invisible Internet darlings. Consider yourselves well and truly nagged - and you best keep it in mind, because while I may have decided not to nag my husband....I'VE MADE NO SUCH DECISIONS ABOUT YOU!!!!!!"},
{"title": "Tore Up From The Floor Up", "date": "Saturday, January 30, 2021", "text": "Sorry I haven't been around.  I've had a terrible case of Old Ladyitis; just generally feeling like absolute shit.  I had to start exercising and I've made some drastic changes in my diet, and now I'm feeling a lot better, but it was grim there for awhile.I honestly think I've reached my limit when it comes to isolation.  Winter weather just makes it worse, and I've become terribly cold-sensitive in my dotage, which is nobody's idea of fun either.  In other news, I got all my yearly check-ups and tests done, and I'm apparently doing great.  I mean, 'really unusual for my age' great.  I'm told that the difficulties I've been having are due to age, pure and simple, and Mr. Internet seems to agree, so I'm taking aspirin and sitting on cushions, chucking down the fiber and wearing two layers of clothes indoors. And reading the Septuagint.This is the original Old Testament, the one that was in use back when Jesus and his buddies were alive.  The one used now? King James thought it needed some tidying up so he 'fixed' it in the 1600's, and cut out a lot of stuff.  I now see why.  The Septuagint is metal.  This is a scary, scary collection of writing.  Not a light read either, but it explains So Many Things.  The Church used the Septuagint until 1611, all across Europe, throughout the Christian world, and it explains a lot of the base beliefs, the art, the traditions and stories, the weird heresies, just on and on.  I should have read this years ago.  Anyone who is a history freak should read this.  It clears up everything, every question you might have had about the medieval and renaissance mindset. Human nature hasn't changed.  People naturally head for the gore and violence, and the Septuagint has it all.  God gets pissed off A Lot. (Deuteronomy chapter 32, verses 1 - 43 is a masterpiece of God being fed up to here with everybody's bullshit.) Everyone is knifing one another. The concept of circumcision is applied in...um...creative ways. Angels appear, do strange things like kick the crap out of you for no reason, and then leave.  Lots of prostitutes around.  Giants pop up here and there.  Other gods exist.  Houses get leprosy.  People live for hundreds of years and have babies way up into their nineties.  Meanwhile Christianity is supposed to begin with the New Testament, and yeah, that's a nice book, but it loses something against the flamboyant wtf of the Septuagint, and priests had to catch and hold the interest of an audience.  You don't do that with \"Blessed are the meek.\" You do that with \"A dude gets raped by his daughters.\"So I still know how to party."},

People all in a group? They were fun!) and the garage. Hence toleration.  Keep it out of my face, we're cool. Now, we have YouTube on our television!I understand that he gets to watch what he wants when he comes home from work.  My busted up old ass is sitting here while he goes out and deals with shit all day, so here, sweetheart, have the remote; and then it's nothing but:1. Supercar crashes.  Now I have to admit, I do love to see someone who has way too much money crash their expensive, overpowered toy.  I do like that.  I also like to see those expensive, ridiculous cars spontaneously combust - they do!  Just going down the road, for no reason!  Go out in a blaze of glory.  An expensive blaze of glory.  Just, go out.  No, what I don't like is a solid fucking hour of Supercar crashes.  There are more idiots per square foot in a supercar video than in any other form of gearhead video, and they're all young and dressed in expensive clothes, and they mill around like the undead, just dead flat 'Whuuuoh huh. I think it crashed, whu happened, izzat burning...uh...'  This is not entertaining after awhile.  This is just angering.  \"Look at all those wealthy little pricks.  She's wearing shoes that cost more than my car and she's walking in the grass with them. Bitch.\" And then you get all grouchy which is not a good look.2. Car crashes.  Shit, I've been in a lot of close calls.  I find nothing entertaining about having those emotional memories re-stimulated by watching 1683554 videos of them.  I live in a part of the world where there is a lot of big truck traffic and general large machinery of various types headed down the road very rapidly, too.  Did you know that if you live on a farm you can drive a large and deadly farm machine and be eight years old?  And it's legal?  These little pricks out here know the cops are on their side, and they'll be driving THIS goddamn thing here:This machine is the size and height of a semi tractor!  See those things on front?  They twirl around.  This is some Mad Max bullshit right here.  on the public two-lane, in town, doing 35 mph in a 20mph zone.  An eight year old kid, driving a zombie killers' dream vehicle!  And they're all up your tailpipe and you check your mirror and there's an EIGHT YEAR OLD KID DRIVING THIS THING and you're the one worried about getting a ticket!  That's my life right there!  Not to mention all the times I've seen what happens to a car full of shavetails trying to get back to base in time for roll call after a late night of drinking.  I've seen cars suddenly head toward the sky for no apparent reason and then go cartwheeling in flames off into the roadside brush and disappear.  Like Nascar on the freeway,  man.  I've driven past the fiery remains of four guys' lives and careers way too many times.  It is not entertaining.3. UNLESS IT'S RUSSIA.  Ever since Russia pulled it's head out, stopped being the CCCP and started being 'hey, money is good!' this once former Workers' Paradise has turned into Alabama.  There is so much highway WTF going on in Russia right now I want to set up a lawn chair and an umbrella in downtown Moscow and just watch stupid shit happen all day long.  People losing tires and tying logs onto the hub, just going down the road on three tires and a log, scraaaaaaaaape.  All four wheels suddenly falling off a vehicle all at once!  Boom!  Car falls flat on the ground, in the middle of an eight lane freeway! and the driver is still trying to rev the engine as his tires are bounding down the road ahead of him! \"This is a big pothole!\" is what I imagine they're thinking.  Cars actually driving up and over other cars - and both cars just drive away.  Just 'gosh, that was weird, huh?'  And the loads - imagine a Lada carrying a whole pallet's worth of ten by's tied to the top of the car with men's belts, touching the road ahead of the car and also behind it - on the freeway, tootling along.  Kid lying in the back package try waving.  Goat hanging out the passengers side window.4. Junkyard crawls.  Now I love junkyards.  I do.  I love digging through those places and seeing all the stuff.  What I don't like is watching other people do it while I sit at home.  They're not even good junk yards, they're just huge plots owned by car hoarders, automobiles rusted to the door handles with trees and shit growing up through them. The narrator is in ecstasies of automotive archeology. \"Oooh, lookit this! Hey, get a shot of this. There now.  That's a 1975 Ford Donkeymax  three litre.  That's raaaare! Boy.  Someone is gonna want this!  Look here, wow, the interior, that floor is rusted out.  Someone is gonna want this!  Windows are all broken out... Oooh look, the trim ring on the steering wheel!  I need one a' those!  I have me a 1968 Ford Donkeymax three litre point eight in the yard I been meaning to work on and that trim ring broke on it.  I wonder if this guy'll sell it to me.  I'd sure like to have that.  That's a rare piece, boy!\"  *old codger voice in the background* 'Not for sale!  I toldja I'm not sellin. None a this is for sale!  Now lookit here, I got an old milk truck, it's a Divco...'  *chorus of 'Ooooooo's* 'Yeah, she's a beauty, that one, my dad used to carry his victims heads in the back there...'And so forth.5. Third world WTF.  Here I am put into the position of looking at the product of someone elses' misfortune and efforts to cope with a broken system, and sometimes, it's hilarious.  I am not sitting in my own home to experience moral dilemmas like that.  But there are some points where you just have to say \"Buddy, a sewing machine is not gonna do that.\"6. First World WTF.  This is when a group of building contractors and real estate salesmen pool their egos and attempt to add inches and girth to their penises by taking a perfectly good car and cutting it up so that it not only looks worse, it runs worse - ON PURPOSE.  See, they're making a Rat Rod.  Its 'cool.'No.  No, what it is, is you fucked up a perfectly good car, so now you're using P12 grit sandpaper adding 'patina', and installing capped truck exhaust stacks, and running barbed wire to your spark plugs.  Not even hipsters think that shit is cool anymore.  Or the Tiki/Rockabilly crowd (who are aging at an alarming rate) and certainly not the Nametags.  No.  What the Nametags want are7.

YOUR SOUL IS DEAD!  Soviet cars-really? No.  Canadian models like the Mayfair, the Frontenac, the Fargo, the Laurentian - listen.  It's an American car, people, with a few minor body tweaks and different badges.  The Frontenac is a mid-range FORD, y'all.  Just uglier.  But here I am at home, and I've got the Biker sitting beside me, and he knows AND WILL TELL YOU, whether or not you're reading a book or online or even in the room, the names and dates of EVERY FUCKING THING THAT COMES ONSCREEN and which one had a modified transmission and what colors it came in and I DON'T CARE AND I'M NOT GOING TO REMEMBER ANY OF THIS.  You'd think after 32 years this man would realize that I am not a motorhead.  No.  I do not remember  that car that was on the cover of Hot Rod magazine last month, and how it looked just like that car we saw for sale three years ago in Centralia.  I DO NOT.  I know, right?  Even though the magazine was in the bathroom (where I went to take a whiz, not read.)  Even though we drove past the car in Centralia three years ago, and it was on a distant hill, and we were going 75 mph, and I saw as much of it as it took you to say \"Look, there's a\" and then it was gone, and I was still turning my head.  I suck.  I don't remember it.People, I am not even exaggerating.  He does this to me!  He does this to me at least twice a week!\"Remember that Pontiac we owned?\" he'll ask.Folks, we've owned us some Pontiacs.  Buying old cars and motorcycle, fixing them up and selling them is his side hustle and always has been, since before I knew him.  We'll drive what we own, get all the bugs out of it, sell it a few months later, time for a new car.  WE HAVE OWNED PONTIACS.  This means that if I want to keep peace in my house I have to engage in this conversation, so I have to say \"Which one?\" in a reasonable tone of voice.\"You know, the one we owned while we still had the Buick.\"Folks, we have OWNED SOME BUICKS.  \"Which Buick?\"  asks Ms. Reasonable.\"The one we had when we had the Pontiac.\"  And he'll be getting exasperated at this point!\"Well, honey, fuck off and jam your Buick up your ass,\" I'll say. - nah.  I won't really say that.  But I'll be thinking it."},

{"title": "So Very NSFW, With Spoilers", "date": "Monday, January 11, 2021", "text": "When I went looking for romance novels online I happened on a winner!  Nobody was more surprised than me. ( Now, this is light and crunchy brain snacks I'm talking about.)  \"Lord of Scoundrels\" was everything it's title and cover art promised and so very much more.  There was a lot of hot Victorian sex, there were harlots and pert behinds, plump breasts and ripping of bodices and exploring fingers finding dark curls, parting them to explore the wet, heated delights of...you get the picture.  If you have to wait in line at the DMV, take a copy of this book with you.  It's a lot of fun! Really!And so I went on looking for another, emboldened by this initial success, and by gosh, there was A.N. Roquelaure, aka Anne Rice!  Well well, thought I, she's tolerably readable, and so I came to open the pages of \"The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty\" which is a whole heapin' helping of WTF.  See, I had searched online for 'Spicy Romance Titles'.  This is not a spicy romance.  This is a whole shitpile of spanking, is what this is.  I do not think that my intelligence has ever been so effectively assaulted by a book.  One thing I now know about Sleeping Beauty that I would have never guessed in my youth? Underneath that pretty dress is a cast iron ass. \"Check this out,\" said Sleeping Beauty.  All the woodland creatures were astonished. \"So that's why she clangs when she runs,\" they  thought.  Then they all went to therapy.This woman gets spanked, whipped, whipped and spanked, slapped, spanked, whipped, strapped, spanked, spanked, spanked and whipped and spanked...after awhile, you get 'paddle fatigue'.  It's not just for rowing teams anymore. Sleeping Beauty wakes up.  Do not ask how, you do not want to know. She gets taken to a palace the size of Delaware.  And in that palace are 3000 princes and princesses and an empress, and they are just nuts about spanking people.   The usual BDSM stuff happens, but only as a kind of thin, modernist frame around all the goddamn spanking that goes on.  No matter what you're doing, from hanging on a St. Anthony's cross catching a snooze (as you do) to high-stepping around in boots equipped with horseshoes, you will get spanked.  Jammed onto the stone dong of a statue and left there for hours? Hung upside-down all night? Sodomized with a riding crop?  You'll be getting spanked, too.  Eating a sandwich?  Repairing a lawnmower? Here comes Mr. Paddle.  The shit never stops.  The place has a whole hostage class of slave/nobles, healthy young attractive people who perform most household chores with their teeth, all waiting to get spanked. Or being spanked, or spanking someone else who is being spanked.  Why they put up with this shit is never explained.  They too have cast iron asses.  Everybody does.  You can just tear up any random passer-by with a leather paddle for an hour in this joint and not only will they not bleed, they'll just weep, quietly.  And then get spanked for weeping.This is not about me being squicky about fetishes.  This is me being appalled by the sheer LSD idiocy of this book. And also appalled at myself for devouring it whole in one day."},

Never going to go away.  They figure it's from Foetal Alcohol Syndrome that I was lucky enough to dodge in the womb, although I got a little on me.  My poor 15 year old mother must have looked like she was carrying a bag of bullfrogs when she walked across the room, with me in there trying to get out from under the Mad Dog-Everclear showerhead in there.Now, every single day of my life is an exercise in fighting off that well-worn groove, because I was in my late-ish twenties before I got that diagnosis figured out, and the angel Prozac blessed me with relief.  Because you still carry those ingrained thinking patterns in your mind, you see, and while you might not be feeling like everything is made of shit, you're still habitually sniffing to make sure, if you see what I mean, and I know that you do.The first thing in the morning when I wake up, the last thing I ever had seriously mess with my mellow and piss me off is right there.  Right there waiting on my pillow.  And my first response is to start in bitching. \"Yeah, you thought you were sly but you found out different ya idiot,\" I'll mutter.  And if I let myself, that will go on all day.  And build.  I'll be folding laundry. \"You think you can pass shit around on me and I won't say a word? Well you thought wrong, motherfucker!\" and my yoga pants will cringe. \"Because I told your shit, didn't I?  And you had the nerve to get all O-Fended, like you have a right,\" and all my towels just go unch ooch unch ooch under the couch and hide there trembling.  I'll be spitting fire. Walking around!  Telling people!This is demented.  I know it.  My house has two hyoooge picture windows that face the sidewalk, and if I really let myself go, I'll be striding around my house doing chores, stopping to tell off the malefactors in my past with my hands on my hips and my head snaking around, stabbing my finger at them to make a particular point, turning on my heel dramatically and walking out of their imaginary life and some group of kids walking home from school is standing out on the sidewalk just staring at me, like I'm on the worlds largest television screen, and all their braincells are dying,' pft, pft, pft, pft...' because I'm the nice old lady in the neighborhood, and here I am acting like Gods motley fool gesturing and and tripping...... and I'm The Only One In The Room.So instead, the very instant that image begins to form in my head in the morning, the instant that I'm fully awake and the last time my daughter said some dumbass thing to me tries to make it self manifest, I cut that thought off short, say 'This goes at the foot of the Throne' and I do one of two things.  I count ten real things in my life that are positive, and I say them out loud.  It can be any ten real things in my life. 1. I have great hair. 2. We still have power. 3. I don't have to run the washing machine today.  And on that way.  It works!  It really does!  It gets me back Here NOW.  In TODAY.  And today isn't bad at all!The other thing I do is start right in and seek out things that are positive, things to see and experience.  Early morning things.  A nice little breakfast.  Straightening things up.  Looking out at my view of the mountains.  Sitting down with a cup of coffee and watching some stand-up comedy on YouTube.We have YouTube on our Visio, and you can find stand-up on there from way back in time.  It's a playground!  And you start your day laughing!  This is like being that one person who, when the Titanic was sinking, thought to put on every layer of clothes they had, steal a bottle of high-end bourbon on the fly from the First Class bar, sprint like a motherfucker to the nearest lifeboat and wedge themselves in tight.  FTW! I am going to survive this shit in style!  Row you bastards, row!I have my favorite comedians past and present. Jonathan Winters, Flip Wilson, Robin Williams, George Carlin, Phyllis Diller, Margaret Cho, Patton Oswalt, John Cleese (BOW DOWN) Dave Chappelle, Ron White, and Christopher Titus come immediately to mind.  Now that last name needs to come to the fore.  I saw a full length special the other day that had me riveted to the screen.  It was called \"Born With A Defect\" and it was Christopher Titus.Remember his T.V. show on Fox?  That show was amazing.  Christopher Titus did not just go crawl off under a rock after it was cancelled.  He went on the road and honed his craft.  And as a connoisseur of comedy, for my money he is the best one out there by a landslide.  A. Landslide.Now if you're white and you can take some rough stuff, you probably love Ron White.  And Ron White, in his prime, is one of the greats. Comedy is music, and the whole thing underpinning it are the elements of tone, rhythm and timing.  Ron White is all over that shit.  He's the grand master.  He's the well-trained Pavrotti to Robin Williams' rogue prodigy Glen Gould.Christopher Titus has Ron White beat by a country mile, folks. And, it must be said, Robin Williams too. I have never seen someone so absolutely the master of his craft.  He gets older, he gets better.  He gains depth.  He learns to use the stage. He learns to use his whole body.  He learns to bring the audience right up next to his face and them toss them back to deal with what he just said, and make them like it.  You  have just surrendered completely the instant he comes on the stage.  You are going to laugh at things so fucked up and so out of bounds and wrong that you'll wonder what you're all about really when it's all over, but during the performance you will be pounding the armrests and sliding onto the floor in hysterics! No choice!Dave Chappelle goes there.  Ron White goes there.  Same thing. Same effect.  Same soul searching afterwards. (Did I really just laugh at a story about cumming down Mamie Eisenhowers' trachea?  What kind of animal am I?) Christopher Titus goes there and stays there, and it just gets more fucked up and funnier until you have tears running down your face and you're lying on your side on the floor laughing, and you're glad the blinds are down because you are making some sounds.Now let's hop in the Wayback Machine and visit Milton Berle.  He could get a laugh with a pause and a change of expression.  Beautiful stuff. Phillis Diller could get a laugh by just standing a certain way.  Goldie Hawn would just roll her eyes and shrug, you laughed.  That's talent. You have the full attention of the audience.Come back with me now, yes, I'm wearing an oven mitt, just take my hand and baaack to TODAY.  I went to see John Cleese live. That man is as old as dirt.  He was urbane.  He spoke in dulcet tones, with an impeccable command of the art.  He spoke in metaphors and used multisyllabic terms, and strode gently about the stage like an elder statesman, and everyone in the audience was pissing themselves laughing.  He began his show with a fucking Powerpoint presentation.  Come on!  And it was hysterical!  Brass balls?  SOLID BRASS.  My Johnny boy is The Man and he should have been the father of my children, even though, and let's not forget this, John Cleese is entirely filled with self-centered disdain for all of humanity, a vessel made of hate gilded with rage and petulance.  I have no illusions about him, and I'd still suck his ancient dick for a nickle.So take the erudition and icepick observations of Cleese.  Throw in some Patton Oswalt and all his education for that chip on the shoulder acid. Throw in Dave Chappelle, the whole dude.  Stir. Add the mania of Robin Williams, the ability to let the universe use him as it's jester on the fly, that improvisational madness.  Take Ron White, chop coarsely, as befits, and chunk him in there too.

{"title": "Romance:  What it is, and where to find it.", "date": "Monday, January 4, 2021", "text": "I am not a romance reader.  At all.  Even though it turns out that one of my favorite books of all time was the pattern for all further romance novels - Jane Eyre - I didn't realize this until years later, because there was so much story and detail, and Jane herself was such a sensible, intelligent woman that the romance angle just flowed.  Reader, it flew by me. (That's some funny shit right there if you've ever read Jane Eyre.)I like to go out of my comfort zone these days in my reading and writing.  I've even made forays into poetry, which turned out to be an amazing and wonderful thing, to my vast astonishment.  Not that I'm going to binge on the stuff, but my attitude has been reformed since the days of sixth grade, when we were all introduced to the stuff by way of Edgar Allen Poe's \"The Bells\" and \"Annabelle Lee\" and \"The Raven.\" You know what I got out of that?Tumpity, tumpity, tumpity tump, tumpity tumpity, tumpity tump.  Ta tump da dump, ta tump, da dump. Tumpity, tumpity, tumpity tump.NO.I mean, that's enough to sour anyone on the stuff.  I understand the teacher was trying to hook us with the magic of 'The Pit and the Pendulum' and 'The Cask of Amontillado' - hey, if Poe wrote cool stuff like that his poetry might not be so terrible, right?  And I'm no judge of the stuff, maybe it was good.  All I heard was kick-drum.And I've tried writing poetry, and I don't know if it's good or bad and I certainly  am not going to inflict it on anyone because you don't just do that to people.  But it was out of my comfort zone, and it gave me a feel for the music of the language. So points for going out of your comfort zone!  It works!I joined a writers group at one point here in Sumas, and found that it contained a group of people who never went beyond video games or anime, thought that 'Twilight' was high art, and wrote a lot of fur-fiction. You know, Shape-shifter stuff. People who could turn into bulls and horses and cats and lived in the deep wilderness in clans and had fights with other clans.  Well, all right, I thought in those first few meetings.  This is appalling, but it's certainly  out of my comfort zone, so I tried to write a little fur fiction.  I wrote a story about a guy who could turn into a wolf.  You know, take it easy dipping my toe into the world of fur-fic.  It came out as something between 'Interview with the Vampire' and 'Trucker Serial Killer'.  It took place at a Burns Brothers (shout out to Oregon!) truck stop all-in-one, like the transcript of an oral history.The writers group were...kind.  Apparently if you're a Shape Shifter, you live in a clan in the backwoods and have battles with other clans of Shape Shifters. You are not a Were-Wo0f.  You are a Shape Shifter.  You do not attack humans and glory in the experience.  You do not have a job.  Oh, I got a million things wrong.  I thought what I turned out was perfectly readable, if pedestrian.  It made sense to me that if you were able to change into a wolf, that you'd want to keep moving around, and have a job, and be a carnivore, and so 'murderous long haul trucker' came to mind.  Now I am setting myself the difficult task of writing a Romance Novel.I have never felt so intellectually challenged in my life.  When I was pregnant, in that last month, I read some Jackie Collins and Barbara Cartland out of sheer desperation and immobility.  I couldn't waddle any further than to the bookcase in the house, and all the former tenants had left behind was not cream of the crop stuff.  And I have to say that using Jane Eyre as a yardstick, Jackie Collins falls far, far from the mark.  Barbara Cartland utterly mystified me.  I found nothing whatsoever in her stories to hang my hat on.  It was like reading something that someone who understood English but came from a completely different culture would write, like, from Saturn.  They knew the language, but the societal forms where just alien as fuck.  Why do I have to read two pages worth of description of what everyone is wearing down to the type of fabric and the cut? Why is everyone a duke or a marquis or a sheikh? Why is everyone heaving and panting and yearning?  Jesus, go for a walk or something.  If you like the guy, fuckin' tell him already.  Send him a note.  LOOK AT HIM.  I mean I did not get it at all.But I have this resolution, and I gave it a try last night.  I figured I'd use Jane Eyre as my guiding light.  Jane Eyre starts out in her childhood and explains to us how Jane got to be Jane, the boarding school, the mistreatment, the development of patience, intelligence and independence, the making of her spirit in the orphanage.  So I went to my childhood for inspiration, and I ended up in a wrecking yard going through cars looking for spare change while my dad hunted down parts to strip off the hulks.This is not the way to start a romance novel.  Even I know that.I mean, what even is romance?  I did not see it, except on television.  I did not have suitors, I was not particularly popular, no boys ever yearned after me (until after high school, when it stopped being an issue of getting a peer trophy to show off to the other boys - then they came a-running.  And I said no thank you, but I do seem to recall not having been good enough for you mere months ago, before graduation, and nothing's changed here.  Go along now and buy some porn.) So that is my question for you all.  What is ROMANCE?"},

You know the type of person I mean? They think they're really roughing it, in touch with the land, man, the real outdoors, tough, maple syrup, colorful fall leaves, mud season, LL Bean - wearing white people with cash. Certain residents of Maine are the same way.  Believe me, Kimball isn't out there sweating blood hoping that his next crop doesn't fail or delivering calfs in the snow.  What is this odd mystique about Vermont?  It sounds like Washington with more maple trees.  I think people from Vermont and Maine need to get over themselves.  You live in a northerly state with shitty weather.   New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana, Idaho and Washington are all northerly states with shitty weather too and we don't go around rhapsodizing about how wonderful and how 'real' and 'authentic' and 'back to the land' it is because shitty weather sucks and we aren't exactly unique weasels up North here.  And then you have an entire fuckin' country just over the border that makes Vermont look like a pussy.  So shut up, Vermont snobs.  And you Maine snobs too.  Nobody is impressed."},

Ron Hubbard, the DEAD (in case there's any lingering doubt out there) former leader of Scientology, was for a brief period of time the commander of a small Navy vessel.  During his short, yet incompetent career as a commander, he carried out his duties exactly as you'd expect - he mined 'a Japanese sub' off the coast of Oregon, and then he sailed South to attack Mexico.Yes.Having detected a suspicious, elongated radar echo in the waters off the Oregon coast, he immediately jumped to the conclusion 'SUB!' and mined the everlasting fuck out of that sapsucker, called in the troops, called in air support, called in the Coast Guard, called in local fishermen, and generally pulled a lot of people away from more serious concerns to come look at what he'd doneded.  Which was to kill a whale.You can imagine everyone rolling their eyes and trudging back whence they came.  C'mon, dude.  Seriously?After that astounding feat of fuckery, what next?  Go attack Mexico, of course.  So that's what he did.  Cap'n Hubbard in his little cruiser sailed straight down to Mexico and proceeded to blast the fuck out of the shoreline with his woefully limited battery.  What he hoped to accomplish by this is not known.  What is known is that he was drop kicked out of the Navy shortly afterward with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.  Of course, you're saying, Captain Queeg got away with that shit for years, no fair.  But you have to remember that Captain Queeg was Humphrey Bogart. He ran a tight ship.  Not even the strawberries were too small to escape his supervision.  And you know that Humphrey Bogart would never dump a bunch of sea mines on a whale.  It just wasn't in the man.I have a brief, pathetic history with the C of SCN.  In my desperation to catch a man I agreed to join the 'church' that he belonged to.  Which was ol' 'Nuke the Whale' Hubbards ship of fools; and I'll say here that I never saw so many ignorant, incompetent misfits gathered under one roof in my life as I did during my short tenure as a member.  Luckily, I'd been through the cult thing with my mother years earlier and so I knew bullshit when I saw it.  I lasted less than a year; and shortly after I left the church and my ex, my ex-husband was frog-marched out the front doors by several burly staff members for throwing one of his tantrums on staff time.  This really happened.  And it proves that there's nuts, and there's incompetent people searching in vain for direction, and then there's 'nutty is nutty but you don't get to turn red and kick over furniture and scream like an infant when you don't get your way and threaten to punch your superiors.'  So he got tossed out onto the sidewalk in the middle of town, and then stood there and raged and continued to have a tantrum until they called the police, which for a Scientologist is tantamount to drinking strychnine - they just don't DO that.  But in ex-hubby's case, they made an exception, and having been his wife, I understand it completely. So, even though it was not an episode of my life that I'm particularly proud of, here's to you, unknown burly Scientologists sick of my ex-husbands hissy fits:"},

You take it out of the package, look at it and go \"Oh no my friend, this is not going to occur.\"  But the Aah Bra is a miracle of expansion.  It works like a Tardis.  Something that looks as though it would fit comfortably on Barbie expands by the power of Greyskull (I assume) to enclose even the most unruly frontage.  Once you get everything tucked in and your nips leveled out, because nothing is sadder than uneven nips in a cold climate, you look reasonably perky.  It's kind of amazing.Do you know how you have to put on one of those things?  You have to step into it. Yes. While it is infinitely stretchy, it doesn't give way without a fight.  The Aah Bra is no pussy.  You have to pre- stretch the thing and then ooch it up over your ass and your rolls and so forth and then drop titty into each pocket while rubber-banding it over your arms and adjusting the shoulder straps.  This is an unsightly operation that looks like that one guy who can pass himself through an unstrung tennis racquet, so I don't suggest you do this in front of a mirror, because it's distracting.   And the instant you bend over, the straps fall.  Oh, your boobs are just fine.  They stay put.   But any back tit or pit rolls are going to be flapping like salmon in the bottom of a boat, and it's a case of either retire to the bathroom and get all your excess  flesh re-arranged in the damn thing or just roll it down over your shoes and kick it into the corner.  Because there's one thing they don't tell you about the thing - it gets HOT.  The Aah Bra is not a breezy piece of clothing.  Once it's on you, it's on for good,  like a python strangling a hapless swamp dweller, and if you crack a sweat, the Aah Bra does not care.  It just melts into your skin and jeers you.This is why I'm generally that old broad.  The one working out in her yard with the whole front of her jangling around under the t-shirt, where you drive by and go \"Oh my God someone should say something.\"  Because only the Aah Bra can tame these tigers,  unless I have somewhere to go that isn't jiggle friendly, I prefer to fly free, and if I'm out in my yard looking like I have a shirt full of raw liver and you're watching, ask yourself why you're checking out a sixty year old womans' tits, ya pervert.___________________I have sweaters, t-shirts and hoodies strategically strewn about the house so if I experience a sudden rise in body temperature I can do a quick change on the fly.  I've got this down to a science - I had my thyroid removed about fifteen or so years ago.  Right on the cusp of menopause.  It was a confusing time. I had to drop out of college one quarter shy of getting my Bachelors, in fact.  When your thyroid goes to hell, it will fuck with you bad, and if you're already a. firmly planted on The Spectrum, and b. beginning to get extra extra because your hormones are feeding your propensity to act a fool, and 3. experiencing the confusing symptoms of Graves Disease on top of 8. raising a teenage girl and going to college, it's an all flags flying colossal shitshow.  With monkeys. Do not try this at home.It's cool if you time it right.  If I'm feeling a hot flash come on, I run for the kitchen, grab the trash and take it out to the curb, and won't notice a thing.  This works like magic.  Of course two minutes later I'll be running for the nearest hoodie, shivering, unable to feel my fingers, but my trash is out of the house and I did it in a t-shirt, which I'm certain the neighbors all envy.  \"Look at that badass old rip trotting around in the sleet with a sack of trash.  I want to grow up and be just like her, momma.\"  I know they're saying it.  And they're right.  Momma, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys.  Give them a \"Live Long and Prosper\" Spock t-shirt and a pair of yoga pants and send them out in the snow now, while they're still young and malleable."},

I had Fire King (early Pyrex) for days. Enamelware pots and pans.  I had every single item in the Foley antique kitchen gadget catalogue in red and white. Yes.  I was venturing into apple green, and had some yellows and a few of  the rare blue ones too. I had vintage electric counter appliances too, like waffle irons, stand mixers, popcorn poppers, toasters...the list goes on. And I  had this stuff in multiples. Twelve eggbeaters.  Four kitchen scales. Four breadboxes. Like that. A LOT of a lot, and all of it, everything mint, perfect.  I had sub-collections like Bakelite handles, glass measuring cups, 1950's chrome appliances...basically I was on the verge of having an all-vintage kitchen.  My husband and I were seriously considering it when we moved into our present home.  We had a color scheme and an era ( 1940's -1950's) picked out.  We got vintage cabinets from the architectural salvage store, put in some boomerang patterned Formica...and all this, up until this point had been totally on the cheap!  I had it ready to go, right down to the escutcheon on the wall switches, the overhead light, and a big old cast iron and enamel kitchen sink!  Only the jump to large appliances remained.

After buying a house? That wasn't gonna happen.  I kept a vintage electric stand mixer because it's in perfect condition and it's just soooooo Deco, and four select pieces of Foley and sold the rest. C'est la vie.   But I seem to have started a vintage soda pop collection without even being aware of it in the meantime.  I realized this as I stood washing the fifty vintage pop bottles I have in my kitchen window.Let's  not forget the wall-mount bottle capper, and the soft drink advertisements.  And all the old bottle caps. Many, many old bottle caps. I made them into a nice frieze over the kitchen doorway and the spiders love to play on it.And that's just the kitchen. My natural history collection and my cookbook collection is in the dining room, and my Tonka Toys are in the family room.  My Tonkas keep my husbands collection of automobilia company, and all of it keeps our house-wide book collection company (part of which consists of my Leonardo DaVinci collection and my 'classics to 1519' collection.)  Some of it sits on my collection of Mid-Century Modern furniture, which is accented by my collection of vintage suitcases, which contain my collection of Last Gasp comic books, part of which is a collection of Gilbert Sheltona and R. Crumb-inalia, near my collection of vintage vinyl record albums.  Of course, none of it compares to the queen of my possessions, a 400.00 replica of the USS Enterprise, under glass, that I keep in my bedroom so I can see it when I wake up every day.  What, like I wouldn't have a Star Trek collection?The funny thing is, it all started with a glass measuring cup. I still have it.  It was given away as a premium inside a bag of flour back during the Depression, and I'll never get rid of it.  Something about that one goofy little measuring cup lit off this urge to collect.  Weird, right?  I never collected anything up until my husband brought that little cup home from the Salvation Army one day, because our other one had broken in the sink.  The instant that thing came into my house, I was like \"I love this look!  It reminds me of my grandma!\" and the rest...is what I have to dust."},

{"title": "Non-Stop Party Action At Rancho FirstNations Continues", "date": "Sunday, December 6, 2020", "text": "So, I finished Marcus Aurelius.  He seemed like a very anxious, bummed-out, harried person, and so there go my aspirations to be Philosopher King of Sumas.  His thoughts read so much like the way I grew up in Catholicism that I felt sorry for the guy.  Basically 'Suck it up, ignore  your feelings, nobody cares about your opinion, it's all in your head, and you're just going to croak and be forgotten anyway.'  Not even kidding.  This dude is no advertisement for being Emperor of Rome.  \"Would you like some honey covered slave girls scattered in edible gold, your Majesty?\"  \"Naw, gimme a bowl of cold oatmeal.  I'm gonna go sit in the outhouse and eat it.  In the rain.\"So, to cheer myself up a read a few old, forgotten Grimms Fairy Tales, which were by turns bloody, really bloody, full of random talking animals and bloody.  And violent.  Me being me, this worked, and so, greatly heartened, I ventured forth outside and did a little mowing with my push mower, for the exercise (That's me thinking.) I...  1. punched myself yanking on the pull starter, then I  2. ran over a dead rat, and then I3. had an asthma attack.  Not because I ran over the dead rat, which to be honest did not look anything like a dead rat until the lawnmower was just starting in at it, when the tail and feet suddenly appeared out of the sodden mass; by then it was too late and I was wearing tall boots so screw it, rats are biodegradable.  No, I had the asthma attack because I've had asthma since 1966 and it was cold and damp and I was exerting myself = asthma attack.I'm going to put in a word here about asthma.  It's not imaginary.  It can't be cured. Nobody knows what causes it. You can control it, and learn to live with it.  So here's what growing up and living with asthma looks like: You look healthy and hale but can't perform the kinds of prolonged strenuous activity that  3/4 of the rest of humankind can, so you have to refuse, which gets you branded 'lazy' and 'a liar.'  It's why, at my last job, I had to go from doing rooms and collecting big tips, to working in the laundry, which is less physically stressful, and does not include tips.  The only tips you get in the laundry of a hotel are the turds that people wrap in towels and send down the chute, lots of baby binkies and for some odd reason, single shoes.  Even when I work out in the yard, it's do a little, then rest. Do a little more, then rest. Rinse, repeat. All. Day. Long.  I'm not a Maserati - I'm a bulldozer.  That kind of thing.  If you know someone who has asthma, don't  belabor them with your ignorant opinions and remedies. For example, this one: 'You just need to stretch out your chest muscles!\"  (?)  I heard this one so many times it's just stupid. I train with weights, folks. The only thing you gain is a stretched out chest. You get to keep the asthma. Don't say \"Oh, it's just allergies.\"  No. It is not just allergies, Karen.  (And allergies are not a 'just' kind of subject either.  They can kill you.  Now you can have allergic responses that trigger asthma-like symptoms.  Or, like me, you can have asthma AND allergies, and have allergic reactions that trigger asthma-like symptoms, that trigger an asthma attack.  Huzzah!)  You can't fix that shit with Benadryl and a couple of aspirin.  \"Just drink honey and whiskey!\"  How 'bout not? All you get a drunk kid who is still having an asthma attack.  This shit was tried on me for years by literally every old person in my neighborhood, including my tea-totaller grandma, who kept a short dog of whiskey just for me if I happened to have an attack at her house -  which is probably why I like a sip of Bushmills to this day.  I was smart enough to sputter and put up a fuss, too, which made my folks even more determined to pour it down me.  While it wasn't a cure, it was fun.  \"Oh, it's all in your head.  Quit feeling sorry for yourself. Everyone knows that asthma is just psychological.\"  Do they.  Funny.  I went through seven solid years of therapy, twice a week, read the books, faced my shit, did the work - with a few shorter sessions in later years - and at no time did my asthma subside.  And yes, having asthma was one of a number of  therapy issues for me.Nobody really knows what causes childhood onset asthma.  For me, it was something that showed up in the middle of my first grade year after a week spent in the grip of a strange, intense floaty feeling.  The buzzy, distant, carefree sensation you get right before you faint, basically, only I never did faint, I just said odd things very slowly and walked around feeling like I was at a foggy remove from everything.  Then one night I woke up and I was barely able to breathe, coughing up guck, and the rest is history. An attack can literally happen at any time.  No trigger.  No warning.  Now yes, strenuous physical activity is a trigger.Sometimes.This is what gets you branded a malingerer.  Asthma is not 100% predictable.Intense emotional turmoil can be a trigger.Sometimes.This is how you get accused of 'playing it' as a way to manipulate people.  I promise you I was not outside mowing my lawn this afternoon trying to manipulate anyone.  Or in the middle of a deep sleep, come to that.Here's what an asthma attack feels like.  Imagine you've just run full tilt boogie down to the end of the block.  You're winded. Suddenly, someone swaps out your trachea for something the size of a cocktail straw, and you have to try and breathe through that, and remember, you're winded already.  Now add mucus!  Gallons of it!  Your lungs are producing it because they're trying to wash away an irritant that isn't there!  Way to go lungs!  This creates a horrible downward spiral of forcing yourself to cough to clear your lungs, which inflames them, which causes them to produce more guck, which you have to cough to get rid of, and so on, getting worse and worse, until you end up in the emergency ward, where I have been about twelve times in my life.  For asthma anyway.  The emergency treatment for a severe asthma attack used to be adrenaline.  It was given in a drip I.V. and you'd go from lying on the gurney like a blobfish to 'fight or flight' the instant it hit.  Worked like a charm.  And also made it look like you, the kid, had been scared out of your fakery by the needle and the hospital surroundings.  There were some very outspoken, bitchy doctors and nurses in those days too.  \"Oh, we see this sudden recovery stuff aaaalll the time with the asthma kids,\" they'd sneer disgustedly.  Thanks folks.  I really needed you to reinforce that notion in my parents' minds.  Kudos to you!In latter years they switched treatments to something else, either using an I.V or delivering it via inhalator, which works on the same principle that a vape does, only it was a much more elaborate contraption back then.  You'd have oxygen being fed through a nose tube, while sucking on this big collection of hanging tubes and drip chambers, and exhaling the most amazing huge clouds of cold, rolling fog; it was awesome.  The nurses would yell at you for doing that. \"Just keep your mouth on the inhalator and breathe through that!\" they'd say.  I say if you're going to come into a hospital damn near dead then you get to have a little fun.The last time I was hospitalized for a severe attack, shit hit the fan in the middle of the movie 'Full Metal Jacket', right there in the theater.  My husband and daughter half pulled, half carried me out past the line of people waiting to go in, and I can only wonder what they were expecting after that sight.So there you go.  I'm feeling just fine now, thank you, I have a shredded rat carcass in my back yard, and the Bejewelled Biker Beast just  made oatmeal cookies and I get them all! Not a bad way to end the day!"},

Last year when the monsoon season began, I basically stayed inside all winter flat on my ass writing and studying, which made the subsequent Springtime Rush out in the garden excruciating!  By the end of Summer, I'm usually in pretty good shape.  I still build up biceps that rip my t-shirt sleeves This is totally a picture of me.  Really.and I'm flexible enough to not just touch my toes, but lay my palms flat on the ground.  You don't use it, you lose it.  To go from a high level of activity to sudden dormancy is not good, which I suppose should go without saying. (Can you say 'severe constipation'?  Then go run outside and scream it in the middle of the street ten times! I'll stay here and enjoy that mental image.)  To spend an entire winter on your ass is super de duper extra no good.I'm seeing the benefits of my new regimen.  Even if it's just doing exercises indoors, the improvement in my mental health in particular is marked.  Whoda thunk it?  All this time doctors really did know what they were talking about.Gotta exercise those brain cells as well.  So, I girded my loins and delved into the world of 20th century poetry, which is way, way, way, way out of my comfort zone - because it is way, way, way, way out of my comfort zone.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there's a lot of stuff out there that is not only readable, but beautiful and enjoyable too.  Will I be forsaking my beloved Beat Poets anytime soon? Not on your amphetamines, buddy.  But I've found out a new thing, and gone in a new direction.  Now even my brain cells will have little biceps that rip their little t-shirts too!I decided to take a more active role in Good Reads, too.  I have three books going at any given time, not including the nonfiction articles I read online, so that's been a pick and choose proposition.  But it's also a form of social media on a higher level of discourse than \"Here is a picture of some clouds\" and \"I hate the Tories\" ; or, as they call it, Facebook.  I just started 'The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius' because I  know how to party.  We'll see how that goes.  Gotta be less annoying that Joyce."},

Do I have those pictures?  No I do not.  Just imagine a tall skinny kid, standing in the middle of a street full of salmon swimming like mad bastards across a wet two-lane road, from a blueberry field into a marsh, with a crowd of people taking pictures and about three semi's stopped in the road.This is trippy country.  Also, when nature tells you it's time to fuck, you gotta fuck.  Even if it means swimming through a blueberry field and wriggling your fishy tummy over wet pavement to deposit your milt/eggs in a cedar swamp.  I'm sure you can relate to the feeling.OH WAIT I DO HAVE THE PICTURE!!!!!Live, from Sumas WA, here is the picture of the kid who hand-caught a fish!Note that this kid is not wearing matching sandals and has been photographed against a backdrop of cedar swamp with what appears to be a house in the background.  I don't know what he has in his pocket, but it's ruined now, because according to the BB, this kid was up to his armpits in the cedar swamp just moments before this was shot.  So there you go.  Kid with a fish, and a borked cell phone most likely.This fish is what's called a 'Chum Salmon'.  It is of such unsatisfactory quality that it was cut up and used to 'chum' for bear, or fed to dogs, or slaves, by the indigenes.  Me, I've eaten plenty of chum salmon pulled in from the mouth of the Columbia River and it's a perfectly delicious fish.  It's the change they undergo as their systems adapt to fresh water from salt water that gives the flesh a weird flavor and texture.  As far upstream as we are from the ocean, this kid probably took one bite of his prize and then fed the rest to his dog.  Old fresh-water chum salmon is a funky, funky eating experience.  Still, to see a natural fish run for the first time in years is further proof to me that Nature is coming back with a vengeance thanks to Covid!"},

It's the period of time between the election of the new President, and when he officially takes office on January the 20th.  All this spreading fear, the tales of locked doors and the Million Maga Marches is the result of credulous people having been trained to be ignorant by the Right media, or just plain not being aware of how their own goddamn country works.  The 'lame duck' period is in place with the idea being that the outgoing president will have time to get his affairs in order, take care of loose ends and get his shit packed and so forth.  It's the 20th Amendment of our fucking Constitution for Heavens' sake!  This is business as usual in the United States. Our press is absolutely guilty of assuming that the general public has any real knowledge of history past who was voted the winner of  America's Got Talent, or who won the Superbowl in 1977.  I guess putting out boring facts isn't as cash productive as reporting The Orangapresidents' latest wacky antics minus context.So if you're in another country freaking out thinking that Trump is going to nail the doors of the White House shut and not come out, Do Not Worry.

{"title": "Lesbians!  Wacky, Wacky Lesbians!", "date": "Wednesday, November 25, 2020", "text": "Well I did my research, wrote my story, and found out a number of very interesting facts!1. I was living in the middle of Lesbian Central back in the day. Southeast Portland, man.  All the co-operatives, the communes, the all-gal apartment houses, the bars, the church, everything!  There I was like \"I need a beer and a lez'bean!\"  And I was knee deep in the things!  The reason I did not realize it was because...2. The lesbian community was so ridiculously fractured and political and insular that it was more like an archipelago of warring islands than it was a community.  I lived in 'Blue Collar, Prison Record Land, which explains a lot. Up the next couple of blocks was 'Total Separatist Land'. Up past them was 'Pacifist Co-Op Lipstick Land'. Over another few blocks and you were in 'Lets All Live In An Undifferentiated Heap And Eat Brown Rice Land'. Then there was the \"Butch As Fuck' apartments and the 'Indian Print Fabrics and Weaving' duplexes. There was one Womens' bookstore and a Food Co-op in the middle of this area (naturally) and they were cruisy in the afternoons, but everyone generally stuck close to home and went to their own bar and store and seldom ventured further.3. The gay guys all did their thing across the river, and they did it better than the ladies.  Downtown Portland is divided into four parts, unlike Gaul, which is divided into three parts. North and South are divided by Burnside Avenue, and East and West are divided by the Willamette River.  In the Seventies, the Northwest and Southwest side of downtown was the wealthy white educated area, and the East Side was everybody else plus Lez'beans.  On the Northwest side,  around the Flatiron Block, and straggling down North of Burnside Avenue were the awesome gay bars (and some freaky ones too, like JR's Cell.)  If you wanted to go out and you were gay and female, you had two choices (if you were me) - go to your local, listen to Hall and Oates, and hang out with grouchy unemployed women who didn't read  -  or go alllllllll the way across the river, and then head waaaaaaay north, to the Pink Triangle, as it was unfortunately called, and go to the fun bars with the good music, where the bathrooms were actually clean, and there wasn't a huge dyke standing by the door making sure you didn't spend too much time in there.  Yeah, that was still done.This cleared up a lot for me.  I knew that there were a lot of politics going on - and I mean a lotta a lotta politics, all strident, but I simply wasn't meant to live up to the ridiculously strict rules that every little tiny faction upheld.4. There was another, scary reason that the ladies were so clannish.  You'd go into another neighborhoods' local and get frozen out.  And I'm thinking what the fuck? I'm cute! I'm a fun date!  I'm a blast when I'm out on the town!  So there I was, all butthurt for years wondering what the deal was, until now, I'm sixty, and I find out that the ladies bars were getting jacked up by the police three times as often as the guys were.  They'd send in a female cop and wait for someone to make a move, and then...yeah. And there I was, unfamiliar, not part of the local 'thing'...no wonder I got the hairy eyeball.  Well screw you, ladies.  You missed out.  You missed out by two stinkin' inches.  What do I mean by that?  I mean that the minimum height requirement for a woman on the Portland Police Force back then was five feet, seven inches.  I am an adorable little 5-5. So if you're gay and sixty and used to live in Portland, and you saw a girl who looked like Bernadette Peters and dressed like Fred Astaire, that was me, and you shoulda said hi. HMMPF."},

That's some funny shit right there.Here the linkie:    https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53763Everybody needs to belong to EGutenberg.  It is The Tits.I'm trying to write a story about a lesbian, so I'm doing my research.  I mean, I was there, but being Bi, I just went around everywhere and waited for the vibe to happen.  I wasn't entrenched in the lesbian community.  (Yes.  In Oregon in the 1970's, lesbians lived in trenches.  It was rough out there.) There was a definite culture going on, but I never stuck around long enough to learn the secret password and handshake.  I just remember really, profoundly, shitty, grim, horrifying bars full of women in casual wear dancing to 'I Can't Go For That' by Hall and Oates. I did learn how to close dance with another woman, though, which was fun.I read Stone Butch Blues years ago, and I only related to half of it, as you'd expect.  A lot of what was being described was not what I saw, either. It being the Seventies in Portland, I was around a lot of younger women trying to rewrite what being queer was all about, and it seemed to be about wearing casual clothes and dancing to Hall and Oates. And boycotting Coors (booo) and drinking Anchor Steam Beer (yay! support your community!)  Then I met my girlfriend, and coasted on that for a year.  So, I study, and in my travels found this little gem of a book.  It's not a terrifically engaging read- BUT! there are some awesome passages so it's worth the slog, lil buckaroo; don't be lazy! - until you get to the Appendix, where there are a number of testimonials from gay men and women of the day.  They're amazing to read.  Everyone is a little leery of coming right out and admitting to the sex, but consider the times.  And then there's those that do own it, and that is absolutely mind blowing.  Think of how brave you had to be to even write that letter, or talk to the author!________________________As long as I'm here I'm going to add this issue:  Women wearing mens' underwear. Specifically tighty whities. This, I do not understand and never have.  Fitted uns are constructed to fit certain bodies.  If you are female and you wear tighty whities, (y-fronts to you Brits) you are going to have this floppy pouch sticking out in front.  It feels weird and it looks weird and it is unpredictably breezy at times. Yes, I have worn mens' tighty whitey-style underwear on a number of occasions. Once, out of of sheer curiosity. (Therein lies a tale.)  The rest of the times, I was out of clean uns.*  My ex-husband, who was built like a chihuahua, wore the same size as I did, so necessity ruled the day.  As petit as he was, I still had that funky pouchy thing sticking out in front. And t.w's have these beefy leg bands that are apparently there so that your dick and balls don't fall out and run down your leg and off into the distance laughing hysterically. They are horrid and they chafe. But apparently wearing these things is de rigueur among studs. This is not a news flash by any means, I know, but...they're not comfortable.  If you're not wearing high heels, why are you wearing Tee Dubs? Why do that to yourself? WHY GOD WHY.Not that I am the Underpants Police, or a Bottom Inspector.  Link follows.  If you don't hit that link your soul is dead.http://viz.co.uk/2014/10/26/dawn-bottom-inspectors/  If you can get with mens' briefs, that is totally OK with me.  I am only concerned for the comfort and general welfare of my people.  So if you're female, and you're reading this post sat in a pair of mens' beefers, take a moment and ask yourself \"Am I really comfortable?  Or am I just sitting in a lie?\"  I think everybody should do this at some point in their lives.  Are you really getting the most out of your underwear experience? Is your hine ruled by your politics, or do your politics rule your hine, or however I meant that sentence to come out?  I say you should always put comfort and hygiene first.  That's why I go commando in mens' sweat pants.*Speaking of a blast from the past, do hit this link (demanding, aren't I?) and revisit the last time I ever wore a pair of mens' underpants, which post is most excellently well and truly described as 'A Blast From The Past'https://opiejett.blogspot.com/2018/09/hammer-time.html?zx=7087e31b821ffb0d"},

Very little gets through.  And then I come to find out that a lot of those birds get left lying in the field. And people are very casual about it; like a living thing is no more important than a beer bottle you'd shoot off a stump.  These are the same people who bitch about all the coyotes coming down from the mountains and taking their February calves, you understand.That's not hunting.  Hunters eat what they shoot.  If someone leaves an animal dead in the field, that person belongs in a gravel pit shooting television sets and washing machines, because that person is not a hunter.  That person is a dick.But then comes Covid, and the skies are alive again!  Thousands of snow geese, swans, you name it, flocks like I used to see when I was a kid! I still hear a few guns go off, and that's the way it is.  But the huge difference it's made in the number of animals I see is remarkable.  Between one year and the next!  Despite my inability to identify the mysterious chubby grey birds, I do keep track of this kind of thing, and I swear I have not seen anything like this since about 1968, back when I lived in another migratory flyway/ bottleneck, in the Willamette Valley.  The skies, day and night, filled with migrating birds.  It's astounding!  Birds blacking out the stars!  The whole auditory landscape filled with the calls of brandts and snow geese, for hours!And I think, fly fast and fly sneaky, birds.  Get where you're going and keep your heads low.  I want my great-grandchildren to be able to see hundreds of hawks kettling overhead, and vast flocks of redwings circling and turning and flashing through the sky like immense schools of fish in the ocean; and the geese flying overhead in chevrons, from horizon to horizon in the Fall."},

Nobody counted the bodies.  Nobody that I knew, anyway.  Everybody I knew, on the television, the radio, the newspapers, were all white.We didn't have to know.We didn't have to know.Not our problem.  It was 'those' people, tearing down their own businesses and homes, look at those crazy people, you think they'd be fighting who they're supposed to be mad at! But see, it's all fake!  No, all they want to do is have an excuse - and I was told this by my parents and other adults - they just wanted an excuse to rob and take away what the 'uppity' ones had, because most of them were too lazy to work. The Russians were behind it.  Destabilizing the nation by riling up the poor dumb people who didn't know any better in the first place.  So bottle them all up and let Devil take the hindmost. That's the only way to make it stop.They say that inside every liberal is a racist waiting to get out.  Me, I'm scared.  And if you listen to Dave Chappelle, he addresses that - hey, white people!  There's this feeling that you might begin to experience...that people you don't even know, who don't even know you, are going to do something bad to you because of the color of your skin.I'm not a racist.  What I am is someone who knows what's right, who wants to do what's right, but doesn't know fucking how.  I didn't know so much, for so long - and didn't even realize I was ignorant - that I AM going to fuck up.  I'm going to offend somebody.  Hell, I may be doing it right now in this post.  I guarantee you that Black rights was not way up on my list of things to worry about when I was younger.  I didn't have to.  So now I'm reading.  A lot.  Way out of my comfort zone.  How many of my neighbors are?  I remember being absolutely appalled at the sheer number of people who lived in my little speck on the map, who were like \"HOORAY!  WE CAN BE OPENLY RACIST AND HATE GAYS NOW!\" as soon as Trump came into office.  Little old ladies I've known for years ffs. Kids my daughters' age.  The sheer GLEE of people who genuinely felt more free once it was 'cool' to hate.  Just following the President's example.They're all out there freaking out right now.  Some very vocal, hateful, ignorant, mislead, average people, half the nation.I've got nothing to end this with.  I need to go find a kitten."},

He seems like a nice, everyday kind of person. I like that.  But here's my point:   For the past four years, everyone in this nation, Red or Blue, has been jacking off to the Funny Monkey and his Tweets.  This poor mook Biden has a long uphill climb, to try and follow that freak show. And face it. The Freak Show was horrible, but it certainly was exciting, wasn't it?  Every day a new outrage!  Another mindless tweet!  Another groping of a foreign dignitary!  Biden is essentially on a tightrope over a bottomless pit of Hot Republican Garbage.  Keep your ass over the rope, buddy. And WTF Republicans?  You used to stand for something, as I recall.  Less government. Increased states rights.  Now you're like those mean girls in grade school, all huddling at 'their' lunch table, hissing shitty insults and tripping the unpopular kids, with the grinning collusion of the Arch Lunch Room Lady, Donald Trump/Vladmir Putin.  (Seriously, I was shocked to see how many people I've known for years suddenly throw off their facades and rejoice in letting their inner bigot out to play during the Trump Administration.  It was fuckin' scary.)  The party that used to be all about self-determination is now nothing but the Ignorant Trailer Park Pukes, violently color-coding their surroundings in blithe disregard of the positive effects of things like public education and genetic diversity.  I don't even know what the hell Montana is any more.

Not start in, or 2. think 'Wow, he was so polite and well-spoken.'Joe, you  have my best wishes.  But it's gonna be tough.  Nobody is going to be wearing a 'Grab My Pussy Mr. President' t-shirt on your behalf, dude.  And that's a good thing, but those bitches are still out there, and so are their husbands, and you scare them to death.  Take no shit, Joe."},

Organizing and consolidating my spice cabinet.  And kids, we have a whole damn three-shelf average kitchen cabinet filled top to bottom, back to front with bulk spices.  I just went through 76 different bottles of various substances, organized them labels forward,  and got rid of all the little half and 3/4 bottles by dumping all the matching substances into other, larger jars, and labelling them.  This took me about an hour, and it smelled really good.2. 11:30 p.m.  I rinsed and ate half a jar of Spanish pimento olives.  This had to happen.  My stomach was a little upset, and if I have an upset stomach, the only thing that will settle it is either a lot of olive oil on a piece of bread, or straight-up olives.  If you don't rinse the salt out of those green olives you end up with a worse problem than you started out with, but I am super smart and so I'm sitting here feeling fine.  Yes.  I know.3.  Took care of my plastic waste.  This means crushing and smashing and stomping on all our used rinsed out plastic bottles, out on the porch, smash, bash, RRRAW GODZILLA and then putting them into a big garbage can, which I did loudly. At  11:03 p.m.   Hi, neighbors!  I'm nuts!  4. Looked up the history of carnivals, amusement parks and fairs - the slang, the people and so forth, and now a large part of my childhood lies in ashes.5. Took lil' Gourdie, yanked off his head to save for the seeds, and then jammed the rest of him into the mouth of our truly huge barfing pumpkin (I got rid of the barf to make room for Gourdie.)  I set this charming vignette up near the sidewalk.  For the past hour people have been slowing down to take a good, long look at my personal weirdness.  I feel happy about this.  It is offensive and inappropriate, and everyone will blame The Bejewelled Beast aka The Biker, and not me, because jolly, chubby, nice  old ladies don't do shit like setting up carnivorous pumpkin-eating-a-baby-displays in their yards at 10 p.m.6. Eaten half a bag of Doritos XXXtra Nacho Cheese Chips because who wouldn't do that at 10:p.m.? (See entry number 2.  I paid for my Dorito-y sins with green pimento stuffed olives, rinsed.  I should sleep well tonight.  Right?  Huh?)7. Made detailed plans to use my Bissel Steam mop on the kitchen and bathroom floors.  Planned that shit out like the Invasion of Normandy Beach.  Then I realized that my Bissel Steam Mop died last month. 10:30 p.m.  Bummed out.8. Decided that making a list of the stupid shit I've done this evening follow a logical timeline was too damn much trouble, and then went into the bathroom and cleaned out my ears with Q-Tips.This is what acting a fool looks like when you are elderly, folks.  You abuse pain medication, drink vodka and eat olives late at night.  This is life ON THE EDGE DAMMIT."},

This pianist was running those keys like he'd invented sound,  and I looked up from the book I was reading - -and there was Elton John.In his prime.  Before the flamboyance got too flamboyant.  Playing solo to a live audience and turning it into something that went into amazing, obscure places and came out like a rack of fireworks being set off one after another.  I set down my book and just watched this performance, Elton making hard, funky love to a honky-tonk piano, lost in his sound, and I was just stunned, amazed, nearly in tears.Back when I was a little Muk I was a rabid fan of Elton John.  Had every single one of his albums.  Even the ones that hadn't been released in the U. S. , I was that into him.  (Shit, I still know all the words to 'The Bitch Is Back', stone cold sober as a matter of fact.)But I had not realized, from 1973 until just this evening, right here in the year of our Lord Covid 2020 that the man COULD PLAY LIKE A MAD BASTARD.I fell into teenage love with the showman without even realizing that he was a prodigy.  All these years later, I watched that young man give 110 percent of himself to an audience that was largely fucked up on pot and there for the showmanship.  I remembered the poster I'd had of him in my room, all hairy chested with a feather...jacket....of some sort... barely covering his adorable pot belly, and I wish I could apologize to the dude.

Every now and then, the ghost of John Glenn goes around with a leaf blower, and all our dusty old www.sins and mistakes go flying off into space.  When he's done he throws a stick for Laika the space dog, and they have a nice time.________________________________________Having given the issue careful consideration, the conclusion is in:  Captain Johnathan Archer was a better captain than Captain James Tiberius Kirk.There.  I said it.Archer did his level best with way less than Kirk had to work with. His poor ship could only do warp factor 4!   And even though there wasn't a Prime directive in Archer's time, he always tried to act as though one was in place.  His crew was more disciplined and far less likely to get dead.  He had a special ops team, the MAKO's.  He was also burdened with something at the rear of the bridge that would blow up like the Fourth of July every time the ship bumped into a rock.  That had to be super distracting for everyone involved.  But he made it home, ended the Temporal Cold War, and participated in an apology ritual involving a chainsaw, which is badass.Kirk was, God love him, basically a pirate.  Well, a privateer, lets give him that much.  And he knew it; his friends knew it, his superiors knew it.  Nobody had any illusions about Kirk.  What he had going for him was a natural ability to command.  He was a born explorer. He had charisma, sincerity....and he was one wily sonofabitch. Odysseus in space.  Never turn your back on Kirk.Another thing I've noticed is that you get the feeling that yes, the NCC1701 crew has been together for a long time, they're all familiar with one another, they're kind of sick of each others' bullshit, and it's business as usual as they interact.  That has yet to be reproduced in any of the Trek series.  Oh, you get a standout character, or pair of characters (think Quark and The Constable) here and there, but in TOS all three of the primary players and their adjuncts are strong personalities, and I think that's why it still has the magic.Captain Picard...was a CEO.  He was a negotiator.  A diplomat.  Kind of a cold fish, and kind of pissy, too.  Now I love me some Picard, do not get me wrong.  He would fuck you up.  But dear Lord the poor man was surrounded with floor sweepings, like a bunch of junior fankids got together and cobbled up characters, then the producers reached into a hat, picked one, and then told the writers 'bash to fit, fuckers.'  I kind of hate to credit Whoopie Goldberg with anything, but Guinan is the only other character on that ship worth a damn.  The rest are just walking loose ends with no feeling of real connection going on at all.   Now, I love Brent Spiner, but he was just cringeworthy on TNG. Do not get me started on Wesley. No.  Or Deanna Troi, yech.  Or the Doctor, gaaah. WTF, woman, leave the kid at home. And what the fuck was Riker?  All he did was run around with a beard.  Mr. Worf had so much character potential! It wasn't for fault of trying on his part. The writers on that show just had their heads up their asses when it came to writing the crew of the Enterprise. But their worst sin?  When all else fails, why, fire up the holodeck! I'm glad that TNG was there to carry the flag.  The fact that the series even existed is the best thing about it.  There you go.  Now that I've gotten all the important matters out of the way, the rest of you kids can discuss politics and covid and trivial junk like that.  You are welcome."},

(Unless you're willing to go through one hell of a lot of screens and info and links and FUCK IT.  I was not; ergo, unwanted account with WohlShart.)  After waiting patiently, I went back like a cringing dog and checked on my order, only to find it cancelled once again.  Really?  Too much for your sad ass to deal with? Funny; Crate and Barrel didn't have that issue.  How strange!  I deleted that bitch. And I did it super undercover.  Now do I believe that WhoreFark actually deleted my account?  Yeah, the same way that FaseBukk deletes accounts; which is, NO, NEVER.  Neither does KuAHRHA. (sound it out.)  All you have to do is mention the name of that smartypants intellectual question-ass site online three months after 'deleting' it, and it reactivates.  Do I sound old and paranoid?  Yes.  Yes, I do.  And yes, I am.  If I can keep them guessing, then I will.  I don't smoke dope anymore so I need something to keep me amused._________________________________Pet Teenager actually made it all the way to Las Vegas and her future.  She is on her way.  We are still in laborious contact (kid insists on texting and my poor dumb phone does not make that an easy task) and she knows that if it all goes to hell, I will be there.  I am stoked, and I am scared at the same time.  But still... imagine getting your drivers license, and then making your first long trip three days later, over unknown roads, from essentially Northern Canada to Nev - fucking - ada!!!  She did that without a hitch!  This kid is going to own us all.  It WILL happen."},

It finally started raining for real; and by this I mean actual raindrops, not the misty crap we've been getting.  The smoke has cleared and it no longer smells like barbecued Oregon!  No!  What it smells like is ONIONS.I have a rather peculiar personal quirk.  After an hour of eating any given thing, even a slice of bread, I and everyone nearby will smell the evil ghost of that food emerging from my pores. Not even kidding. If I eat a single piece of plain white bread, one hour later I will smell like a Franz bakery, and other people will notice it.  Ew, right?  I have always been like this. I don't know what causes it, but there ya go.  If I ever have to ditch and go on the run, they won' t even have to call in the bloodhounds.  Just call a sommelier and let him huff a sample of my last meal.  They'll go right to me.  This is probably why there isn't more crime in the world.  I'd like to be out committing crimes, knocking over banks and doing all kinds of crimes and vandalism and train tagging and so forth, but if I did the cops would be waiting for me at my front door going \"Shoulda skipped the Reuben sandwich.\" And I would get tazed.I go through so much deodorant it's ridiculous, and I use the industrial strength guy stuff, too. I use lots and lots of  air freshener, fabric freshener, incense and essential hippie oils all over the house. I shower a lot, and I clean the shower with bleach, too.  I drink 8+ glasses of plain water a day; I am the most well-hydrated person you know, trust me on this.  I change clothes three times a day. I keep my clean clothes in a separate room from my bedroom!  But  the farmer across the street can be having his field treated with liquid manure, literally, and all you'll smell if you're standing next to me is the ham sandwich I just ate. When this becomes personally disturbing is when I've eaten something really intensely perfumey.  Raspberries, for instance. Say I eat a single box of raspberries. The next time I pee?  The bathroom will fill with the strong aroma of raspberries and ONLY raspberries. No kidding.  When you are sitting on the throne and your pee smells delicious, it will weird you out.If  I've been eating my friend Balbir's curry, which smells like a whole garden of flowers and spices?  I've had a person actually ask me 'Man, what is that amazing air freshener in your bathroom?  It smells like a headshop in there!  I love it!' And this is after I flushed.  The door has been open.  Fan going.  I told them it was Glade 'Spice Islands' air freshener spray.  There is no such damn thing, of course, but I wasn't going to say 'I just took a rockin' piss.  Isn't it amazing?  Breathe that in! Yeah!'Last night I ate some pulled pork barbecue, and the sauce was heavy on the carmelized onions.  This morning I woke up inside a giant pulled pork barbecue sandwich heavy on the carmelized onion sauce. So I did what I've been doing since I was a kid.  The first thing I do every morning is open my bedroom window and turn on a fan and close the door.  Just leave it going all day.  If it's cold out, I stuff a towel under the door.  I learned real young that I don't want to sleep in a room saturated with the concentrated ghost of a weeks worth of everything I've eaten.  It smells like the dumpster behind McDonalds.See, I would rather be able to wiggle my ears, or be able to crack my knuckles or touch the tip of my nose with my tongue or something charming like that, but no, I am not that person.  I am the \"Do you smell kosher dill pickles?  Because I smell kosher dill pickles like crazy in here!\" person.Do you  have a personal quirk?  Can you stuff an orange up inside your foreskin?  Do rodents live in your weave?  When you walk into someones' house, do the walls start to bleed?  Do share in the comments below!"},

Piggot - Crazy As A Shithouse Rat", "date": "Tuesday, September 29, 2020", "text": "In Portland Oregon, on Marquam Hill, there is a small white castle, an utterly charming little building that is supposed to have been brought from Scotland - taken apart carefully, drawn and numbered, loaded aboard a ship and reconstructed in Oregon.  This story is, sadly, not true, but it's romantic, isn't it?  No, that little slice of fantasy is Gleall Castle, Piggots' Folly.  C.H. Piggot was a lawyer, and he also owned a brickyard.  The entire castle is made of bricks painted white, and there isn't an angle in the place - deliberately.  Mr. Piggot was, at that point, merely eccentric.  He designed his pretty home, had it built, lived in it for two years, and then went broke.At some point in the story, he also developed a whomping case of the WTF's.  There are no adjectives that can pinpoint the exact tenor of his nuttiness.  But he wrote a book that gives you a pretty good idea of what his wife and kids had to put up with: Pearls at Random Strung, or, Life's Tragedy from Wedding to Tomb, by C. H. Piggot.  You can read it here:  https://archive.org/details/pearlsatrandoms00pigggoog/page/n8/mode/2upBut you probably won't. I know you people.  You're all...adult, and stuff.But if you love reading crazy people writing like I like reading crazy people writing, you need to deal with this Victorian crackhead.  This is some prime crazy people writing.  I can see him suddenly rushing out in the middle of an important meeting to go hunt up a quill pen and some paper to write down some of this stuff, and everyone in the room rolling their eyes and sighing.  I can see his kids at school sneaking and sliding down the corridors and hiding in the bathrooms after this work of sheer wahoo nuttiness was published, because....it's a doozy. Some gems:  (Paraphrase) Human hair is made of vegetable matter, and bleeds out your intelligence when it is cut.  Eating dark colored vegetables will prevent baldness. And never wash your hair, or cut it; just give it an 'electric' washing with the tips of the fingers.  Cutting your hair makes you stupid.  Having an underweight brain also makes you stupid.  Smart people have heavier brains, and long hair, which they assumedly never wash.All the human stomachs in the world are either acid or alkaloid; the former class should live in an alkaloid country, the latter should not.(Paraphrase) Half of all suicides are caused by overheating of the spinal cord during sleep.  Never let that spinal cord get overheated. The life you save will be your own.Every person in the universe that sleeps with one particle of clothing more under him than over him, hearafter, should be beaten with a stuffed club.(Paraphrase) Moles have the best hearing in the animal kingdom.  Coming in at second is the woodpecker.(Paraphrase) After you have retired for the night, inject a quart of soapy water up your bunghole to prevent tuberculosis, which is caused by thousands of invisible worms.  And hold it there.  A quart. This is guaranteed to 'knock the worms silly.' I...just... daaaang. If you read Patience Worths 'A Sorry Tale' - and mind you, Patience Worth had been dead, deceased, popped her clogs, met her maker, gone to join the choir invisible, some years before she dictated this...story, about...things...to Pearl Lenore Curran - and actually made it through the whole book, ha ha! (inside joke) then you will ADORE 'Pearls At Random etc.'   God, this guys' poor wife!  Now if she wrote a book, boy, I'd be on that thing like a thing that is on another thing quickly.  Can you freakin' imagine being married to this fuckin guy?Well, no you can't because you haven't read the book yet, and you probably won't, but you should."},
{"title": "Hippie Household Hints!", "date": "Sunday, September 27, 2020", "text": "I can tell that you need to get your kitchen and household shit together.  Luckily, I am here to give you a shot upside the head and set you on the right road.  Cease your long downward spiral into household entropy.  Read on, Grasshoppah.-A Long Stick.  Are you a short little shit like me?  You need a 3 ft. long stick in your kitchen.  You will not believe how you got along without this simple, helpful object.  You can poke bugs.  You can test your fire alarm without standing on a chair. You can ooch things from the top shelf and catch them in a towel. If something falls between the refrigerator and the wall, you can hook it out.  -More than one of every stovetop kitchen utensil.  If you want to cook big, you keep a pot of soapy water in the sink and just swap out and rinse as you go.  Around August, when the garden gets going, you will thank me for this advice.  And remember:NEVER USE METAL UTENSILS IN TEFLON COATED PANS.  -Kitchen scissors, two pairs.  One regular sized, one barbarian sized with all the grippy weirdo things on it, like a jar lid gripper and a bottle opener and that kind of shit.  Spray paint them bright obnoxious orange so if some dipshit steals them, you'll be able to find them and return them to their rightful place.-A Dyson Vacuum.  This Dyson motherfucker knows what he's doing.  A Dyson vacuum is worth every single dime you pay for it.  And if you run out of things to vacuum, you can just lie on the rug and trip on the amazing design.  Yes, I know the dude ends up inventing Skynet, but for now, just enjoy the suction.-Braggs Aminos.  This is unfermented soy sauce, and that 'Propoganda Soap' company puts it out.  The label makes for endlessly interesting reading.  I know people who put this stuff on everything, and that's a bridge too far for me, but it certainly won't kill you, and it doesn't taste bad.  It tastes like a mixture of fried mushrooms, soy sauce without the sharpness, and brown miso.  That flavor profile.  Loves red meat and is a perfect ingredient for a marinade.  Anything where there's tomato, onion, red meat, beans, will be improved with a dash of this stuff. Plus you get aminos. AMINOS MOTHAFUCKAH.-Chopsticks.  Drop something down the drain?  Chopsticks to the rescue. Get the good ones, tableware quality, long and thin. Got one of those coffee to go mugs with the long plastic straw, and the straw is getting all weird?  Run some hot water through there and get in at it with a chopstick.  Clogged mustard or ketchup squeezie? Chopstick. Clogged hole in the coffee maker basket? Chopstick. Got long hair and no tie-ties? Chopsticks. If you are particularly dexterous you can even use them to eat with, like a fork and knife, and to cook with too.  Chopsticks are basically amazing.-One (1) metric shit ton of dish rags.  I make my own out of old towels.  You cannot have enough clean dishrags around, and terrycloth is the way to go.  Anything that needs a serious soapy water cleaning, any big spills or overflows?  You will be calm and unruffled, for you have one (1) metric shit-ton of dish towels to deal with that shit. Throw them in the washing machine and lo!  Reuseable! Wow!-Leftover paint from the last time you painted your kitchen.  Put four golf ball - sized rocks in the can to help re-mix it when you need it - just shake it up for a minute -  tighten down the lid, and when you gouge a huge chunk out of the paint during a random ninja attack, you can touch it up.  Also good for those dings and scrapes, and the place where the blueberry pie filling splashed.-Low-splash bleach.  This is just bleach with a little gel in it.  This is also the difference between lots and lots of ruined clothes and being able to wear your favorite 'Deadpool' t-shirt while you clean out the bath tub.  Whoever invented that stuff is BRILLIANT and I love them.-Manual can opener.  Take your pick.  I used a 'Bossie-Bully' for years; also known as a 'halberd' style opener. You jam it into the metal by main force, and then lever it around the top of the can using the seam as the anvil.  Problem is, I'm clumsy, and sometimes I'd come down on that can like I was killing Hitler and the contents would come geysering up, which is counterproductive.  It's also hard on the hands and wrists if you have arthritis.  Get a good clamp-style opener, the one where you turn a key on one side, and don't cheap out on this - get the big blocky one.  Power outages gonna happen in the New Normal.-Magazine postcards.  Reading a book?  Instant bookmark.  Poor little bee or a lost spider gets in the house?  Put a clear waterglass over the lil' dude and then gently slip that postcard under there, nudge the bug up onto the paper or the glass.  Now flip it over and you have a covered container with a confused bug inside. Take it outside and let the poor little buddy go. Who knows, he or she may end up subscribing to Hot Rod.- Many pegs for hanging many things on in the kitchen, pantry and laundry area.  I don't like to dig around in a drawer looking for shit.  I want to reach out and grab it when I need it.  The Biker and I designed a kitchen where all the tools and our teflon pans can be hung up, not getting damaged or dull, ready to go. -A magnetic bar up on our refrigerator that holds our knives.  Up high, in the open, out of reach and grasp of grandchildren, the knives aren't clanging around in a drawer or getting all weird in a knife block. And I have a word to say about fuckin' knife blocks. Those things are not clean.  I dropped one once at a garage sale and it split apart and the sheer amount of nasty greasy guck inside it was like 'Nope, not gonna invest in one of those EVER.'-A shop-sized air compressor.  You do not know how handy one of those things are until you own one.  Particularly on a really hot day when you've been out sweating in the garden. Whooooo!  Breezy!  Shit; close that garage door down and turn up the tunes and you can have yourself a 1980's MTV video party all by yourself! \"Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down....\"-A food dehydrator.  And not the punkass round ones they sell, but a regular deluxe big square box shaped one with trays and a fan.  Mine was built in California by some hippie commune back in the late 1960's; I still have the manual for it and there's a picture of Captain Spoonbender and Moonchild Wolfwoman and Turmeric Peace and their kids all standing there happily on the cover.  Food dehydration was a big deal during the live foods-Jethro Kloss era, and this thing was built like a tank.  It has served me faithfully for close to 20 years, and I use the hell out of it.  I don't waste a lot of food.  Thank you, unknown hippies.  Ya did good.-My spray cleaner.  It's a spray cleaner! It's a bug killer!  It sanitizes! It kills mold and fungus! It leaves no streaks!  It cuts grease!  Add one tablespoon of rubbing alcohol to one tablespoon of Dawn Dishwashing Liquid in a 32 ounce-sized spray bottle, add water, stir to mix, and get cleaning.  You spray it on a hornet, that hornet dies.  Then you wipe off your window and look, you have a clean place on your window you can see through!  I spend nothing whatsoever on spray cleaners and haven't since 1978. Zero. This stuff is the shit.  It will remove stains in cloth, clean toilets, tubs, sinks, walls, the top of the fridge, spray it on the floor and run the sponge mop over it, wash the car, wash the aluminum siding on your house, the deck, your front door, your windows with a squeegee; it's excellent.OK listen.  I will break this down into American dollar and cents.1 regular sized bottle of Dawn original dishwashing liquid - $1.991 regular sized bottle of 99% rubbing (isopropyl) alcohol - $2.99Any random 32 ounce spray bottle - .68 CENTS.You spend basically 5.68 cents on the whole shebang.  One mixed batch in the spray bottle lasts you at least three months (unless you're really filthy.)  You re-use the spray bottle.  Water comes out of the tap. You get to break down the tablespoons/ounces bullshit because I was an English major. These supplies last for YEARS.  Now tell me I don't have the tiniest little carbon footprint in the fuckin' world. -Dawn original dishwashing detergent-Rubbing alcohol 90%-A little tiny electric fan. I hang it up on the kitchen wall right by where my dish drainer is, and the dishes air dry in nothing flat.  Also useful for cooling off hot food quickly so you can dig in if you're really hungry and can't wait.-TUPPERWARE.  I have more Tupperware than Carter has little liver pills.  Tupperware is awesome.  There is a dude that comes around to all the local swap meets and fairs, and all he sells is old Tupperware, and I hit him up every time.  I've probably put his kids through college.  Since I hand-wash, no problem.  Arguably one of the most perfect utilitarian designs ever conceived, too. -  Huge upright storage freezer In The Kitchen.  Not out in the garage or the shed but In. The. Kitchen.  Right where we can work out of it.  We run onto half a beef or some game out here, the big storage freezer is always right there handy and ready to be filled.  It's full of frozen chili, stew, soups and stock, and all my processed produce - me and canning do not get along - so again, we use the hell out of this, and the arrangement just makes good sense.  When it's in the kitchen, see, you don't end up throwing away a bunch of freezer-burnt stuff every year because you forgot you had it.  It also gives you more surface area for those grandkid masterpieces and saucy magnetic charms.-1975 edition of The Joy Of Cooking. (Among those in the know, the 1975 edition is the BEST edition. Yup. I am just that cool.)  If you are a Boomer aged person, this is your cookbook.  It has all the food you remember, with all the correct methods laid out in a useful and easily grasped manner so you can make that stuff turn out gooooood.  It also has a section before each category that talks about the hows and whys of cooking and ingredients.  Why does food brown?  What is it about eggs that makes things stick together?  Just as a useful teaching guide, this has got to be a classic of the textbook category. It is a tool.  The cover is sturdy and stains wipe off.  It's got a sewn binding. It has an impeccable index and table of contents. It has two red ribbons in the binding so you can mark your place. I use both - one for the last thing I cooked, and one for the thing I am presently cooking, or perhaps the place in the index I need to visit next.  Plus a recipe for possum. Yes. If you have a possum that needs cooking, The Joy of Cooking has got your back.The only other thing I can think of that you could use that I know would work like magic is My Biker.  And you can't have him.  So fuck off."},
{"title": "No, No, You Can't Take That Away From Me", "date": "Saturday, September 26, 2020", "text": "I have a list of things I must have.  Most of the stuff on that list is food. There's other stuff, but yeah, I'm doing food this time around.NOTE: I quit smoking dope a couple of years back.  One of the weird side effects was that while I still get cravings, it's not just for any stupid thing to stuff into my face anymore. It's always for something specific, and nutritious.  Food actually tastes better now, and my appetite has diminished!  So hey, all hail 'realizing that I'm not 16 anymore' shall we?Food was a big weird deal when I was growing up.  My mother used it as a weapon.  And she was from the generation that believed that if you boiled everything you ate, it was safe.  Which is great as far as cauliflower goes, but not so much steak.  And yes, boiled steak.  That thing went in the pan and the lid went on and that chunk of cow turned grey all the way through.  All the people they knew, that whole generation, they all did that shit, and I figured OK, this is old people food.  But see, my mom would figure out what you liked, and when she got mad at you?  Off the menu it went.  Permanently.  Me and my dad both.  We used to love it when we had company; she'd make a big, huge, serve-yourself taco spread and it was like \"OMG vegetables!  Cheese!  Ground beef!  Salsaaaaaaaaaaaa!  There is a God!\"By the time I moved out we were down to stew Every. Single. Night.  And I mean stew done up in a pressure cooker.  YES.  You remember that sound?  That steam release valve rattling?  I remember that fuckin' thing rattling around for two solid HOURS.  She'd light up a smoke and be into Merv Griffin or doing the T.V. Guide crossword and that thing would be whistling and rattling and sputtering out grey watery stuff, and I'd creep past thinking Please God No.  Everything that came out of that pot was like the victim of a transporter mishap.  Those chunks were big, kids.  Mom didn't have the lung capacity left to go around chopping shit up fine. So carrots, potatoes, onions like dead jellyfish you find on the beach, green beans...but it was all the wrong color, and it all fell apart like an old snowman the instant you touched it.  And the meat?  No.  You could knit with that stuff.  It would all separate into long strands, and the fat was all melted out, so you got this little goober of stuff doodling around in there.  It was ghastly.  And she didn't give a damn.  Not one.  Hell, she grew up eating oatmeal three meals a day during the Depression. Plus, she was a smoker - no filter - and her taste buds were dead.  My dad?  He'd stop off at The Red Lantern on the way home every night, have dinner, get plowed, come in and shove whatever was slapped in front of him into his face; he didn't care.  His sense of taste was vacationing in Canada.  He wasn't registering a damn thing.   So.  List follows.  I must have:Fried Chicken. Mashed Potatoes. Gravy.  This is a perfect meal.  Hot or cold. Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack.  Cold fried chicken and a tall glass of cold milk is one of the great lunches in the world, period.Meatloaf. Cream Gravy. Mashed Potatoes.  This is also a perfect meal, but you have to do it right.  You don't let that poor meatloaf boil in there.  You pour off the juice halfway through the cooking time and use it in your cream gravy.  Oh Hell Yes.  You can even make a sandwich with this meal. Let it all set up overnight and then put it between a couple of slices of bread. That cream gravy plays the part of the mayonnaise.  Just let it be.  Blop on a few spoonfulls of cold mashed potato and then lay a slab of meatloaf on there, and chow down.Now, I do not mean you should eat disgusting gross meatloaf that has had a bunch of fucking ketchup or tomato sauce or BBQ dumped all over it.  THAT IS NOT MEATLOAF.  No Tiki meatloaf abominations either, like people putting slices of pineapple on that shit. DO NOT DO THIS AMERICA.  Meatloaf is a beautiful thing.  Don't abuse it with your depraved tastes.  Let it be free. Put it in the pan, get your hand wet, or use salad oil, and smooth the top all over until it's a glossy and perfect dome.  Let it spend the last 15 minutes of cooking time right up on top of the oven under those heating elements so it gets all brown and smooth on top.  THAT is a meatloaf and it is glorious.Spaghetti Bolognaise.  Yes you have to put that minced chicken liver in the sauce, with the tablespoon full of strong black coffee.  If you don't, you fucked it up and now you just have plain spaghetti with tomato sauce that is lonely for it's two buddies.  Still, it's better than having no spaghetti with tomato sauce at all. Anything is better than that, face it.  I have this very dish almost every morning for breakfast, and I drown it withOLIVE OIL.  Gotta be the good, nippy Spanish stuff.  Extra Virgin Cold Pressed.  I will put a quarter cup of olive oil on there.  I will even drink a shot of olive oil plain every now and then, because I crave it.  Why?  I do not know; but I have the arteries of a 16 year old track and field star.Pork Chops.  Now, I can take or leave a hot pork chop,  but a cold pork chop is Heaven.  One of my favorite lunches is to wander around my garden, eating a cold pork chop and drinking a Bloody Mary.  It is a perfect combination of all the senses.  And the Biker can make a glorious pork chop that makes lesser pork chops hide in shame.Kim Chee.  I love this shit so much that thinking about it makes my mouth water.  Kim Chee is better than puppies.  Not cooked puppies or raw puppies; I'm not a monster, I'm just saying to mean that Kim Chee is one of those perfect combinations of flavor.  Up our way we have a little lady who has a shop called 'SUJINS' FERMENTATION.'  It is in downtown Anacortes. This lady, Ms. Sujin, this woman touched by God's hand, makes kim chee that is so delicious that you will weep for joy and gratitude.  She makes it in huge clay pots that she buries for a year in her back yard, and what comes out after that year is a miracle.  And she makes all different sorts too; it isn't about just Napa cabbage.  The Korean people have a whole galaxy of fermentation-preserved vegetable combinations and there isn't a bad one in the bunch.  When I was down there this last time I ate a whole jar of it.  I jones for this stuff. But the best thing is that Kim Chee is like chicken soup - it cures whatever ails you.  If you have any digestive disorders, kim chee will fix them.  It replaces all your tired ass, worn out gut flora with beautiful, brand new, healthy flora, and gives your insides a good encouraging pep talk and fixes you up so that by the end of the day you feel better, everything that needed to get gone is gone, and your stomach is your friend again.  Kim chee on rice with a splash of toasted sesame oil is another breakfast favorite of mine.  And if you doubt my claims as to it's superhero status, look that shit up.  It's one of the most healthy things you can eat on the face of the earth.Now one of you is going Waa Waa I don't like spicy food.  Fuck ya, you pussy.Kim chee doesn't need to be red hot.  Yes, it has lots and lots of red pepper in it, but it can just as easily be mild red pepper as it can be hot; the Scovilles don't change the delicious flavor.  Ms. Sujin makes mild, nippy, hot, and 'hot enough to eat it's way through two decks of the Nostromo' varieties of everything, so even your pussy ass will be able to enjoy it.  Kim chee?  The only health food that I believe in 100%...except for CHICKEN SOUP.  I was taught how to make chicken soup by Shirley, that lady in the picture there standing next to her husband. That is the old Dave's Delicatessen down on 3rd and Morrison in Portland, Oregon. They were so good to me there, and I miss them so much.  I always came out feeling full and happy.  Bless them both.The soup has to cook for three days. This means overnight too. Yup. You just turn it way down to almost nothing and cover it with a little gap left open for the steam so it doesn't get that stale, crock-pot taste. And you don't boil it, ever.  The top of the soup must just shiver a little. You must stir it a lot so that everything breaks down and releases it's essence.  If you want to scum off that grey,  curdy stuff that floats on top, go ahead. It can be kind of liver-y tasting.    Now from this beginning point you can go in hundreds of different directions.  You can strain and clarify it, add some this and that and make regular chicken stock.  You can eat it as is if you don't mind picking out bones, but don't because it's gross.  You can strain it, reduce it, and just season up the broth to drink; there's nothing left in the solids anyway; throw those down at the corner of the garden for the birds.  Put that finished broth in the refrigerator, it will set up like pudding overnight and any stray solids will have sunk to the bottom, ready for you to scrape off and feed to your gimp.  Chicken soup is MAGIC for children.  You have a kid with any kind of a complaint, you feed that child some nice warm chicken soup in a mug and just let them sip on it, and it will cure that child.  I tested this on my own child.  She grew up and got a career in engineering.  Coincidence?El Yucateco Green Chile Sauce.  Do not eat this ever.  You will die.  It will kill you.  I have been eating it for so many years it's nothing to me whatsoever except DELICIOUS.  It has a fruity, flowery, almost a citrus flavor, a real green pepper flavor that loves eggs like Mickey loves Minnie.  With Huevos Rancheros, or Chorizo with eggs?  Now I'm hungry.  On top of plain old refries and cheese is the best way to eat it, though. I drown it. The whole top of that bowl will be green once I'm done. You can do dog work for a whole day on one bowl of that.  Once again, the combination of beans, cheese and chiles is one of the most nutritious meals you can eat. You'll be the healthiest corpse in the mortuary.Cabbage Rolls.  A Roma lady taught me how to  make these when I was 19.  She and her whole family were on their way up to the Feast of St. Anne celebration in Canada, and the whole huge group of them had chartered a flight and a block of rooms where I was working. To thank us, she and her daughters made hundreds of the things and everyone on staff was called into the office and we all feasted.  Now what she was making was exactly halfway between a knish and a cabbage roll, but her version had apple vinegar and a metric shit-ton of sweet smoked hungarian paprika (You can find it in bulk at a halal store.  And no, it's not hot, ya pussy.) - I know this sounds kind of appalling but believe me, it works.   Every now and then, I get a ferocious craving for these beauties, and nothing else will do. It has it's own unique delicious, apart from every other food.Raw Oysters. Oh get over yourself.  A little raw oyster that has had a happy life, innocent of all toppings, seasonings and sauces, is an entire tour of the ocean in every single sweet, mild, ethereal bite; all textures are hinted at, all the places in the sea, and all the creatures.  A small raw oyster that's been purged correctly is a masterpiece, something you think about and eat slowly.  It is the only food that I will drink wine with, and I want a very light, mild white wine, not dry at all, but just enough fruit there to put the period at the end of the sentence. I will linger for an hour over a plate of these; twelve happy, innocent creatures who gave their lives to a grateful human.  A Penn Cove oyster can bring me to tears.Chow Mein.  Good old sleazy, goopy chow mein.  There are times when only fake ass, white people chow mein will do.  And it has to have a little soy sauce on there too. When covid hit hard, a few months ago we were getting scared, and it got to be too much, I looked at the Biker and said 'Dude, we need some chow mein,' and he said 'OMG we do!\" and he made some chow mein, a huge pot of it, and it saved our sanity.  This sounds ridiculous, but it's true.  Maybe it's a childhood memory thing, because for him and I, going to a Chinese restaurant back in the 1960's was the height of special exotic events.  That was a birthday thing, an anniversary thing, very fancy indeed. Chow mein saved the day.A Reuben sandwich/Monte Cristo sandwich.  I lump these two together because they both fill the same craving place.  A Reuben with Swiss cheese, a simple sauerkraut, good corned beef, a nice, rough mustard on rye served with a kosher dill pickle spear and a Scottish Ale is LUNCH BITCH.  One of the great lunches.  And lunch is a very particular meal.  Breakfast is necessary and dinner is something you think about, but lunch is for the working person, and it has to be a certain way.  You either need it to get you to dinner, or to make up for breakfast, and for me, the Reuben meets the challenge. You gotta put it on the flat top and get it warm and the cheese melty.  It can take a little manhandling.  It isn't drippy.  It has strong, delicious flavors that work really well together.Now I have been all over the fuckin' Net and I cannot find a decent Monte Cristo to save my ass, so here is how it's supposed to be made the RIGHT way.Start out with a really dense bread.  NOT sourdough. Potato bread is good, a light rye even better.  Now you need Thousand Island dressing. Yes.  And Swiss Cheese. Corned beef, a little plain sauerkraut, and scrambled eggs. Now let's put this fucker together. Stack it up evenly - structure is crucial.  Spread the Thousand Island on the sauerkraut side only. Make sure that corned beef is sliced thin, but that there is a lot of it. Now turn it sauerkraut side UP and  press the whole thing with a pan. Don't reef on it, just get it all evened out and everybody in there acquainted.  Heat up that flattop and get a lid ready; heat it up.  Now, dunk that whole sandwich into the scrambled egg, and I mean sozzle that thing around in there.  Get it good; get all that scrambled egg into every crevice.  Slap it on the flat top and put the lid over it.  Give it a minute.  Turn it over; back goes the lid.  Now take the lid off, make sure it's all dry, that no egg is running out. Press down and give it another squeeze to make some juice run out and turn into a crust that you fold back onto the side of the sandwich, and put that fucker on a plate, slap a pat of butter on top, and sprinkle it all with powdered sugar.  Send it out.  It makes no sense.  It is probably against the law.  You will have to take half of it home with you, so wrap it up good and put it in your pocket or your purse and have that other half for dinner. It will turn you into a hero. This sandwich will actually convey heroism upon you. You will be lifting rail cars off small children and doing parkour; people will ask you for your autograph, you will be able to turn the channels on your television with your MIND.Duck liver pate'/chicken liver mit schmaltz.  See, I know how to make this stuff.  People complain about the 'cardboard' taste of liver, but if you know the secret, and I do, you don't get any cardboard taste.  You get the very mystery of the animals' life.  When I used to do Christmas Eve Open House I always had one or the other on hand, because I knew that I'd be the only person brave enough to eat the stuff.  You poor saps do not know what you're missing.  And that's fine with me. I'll just take that...It is stupid o'clock and I have run out of 'must-have' foods.  That probably means that I've got the essentials down, though, so I'm happy with that.  Recipes gladly shared via request."},

Here's what I mean.  Take a show made in Mexico, by a Mexican film crew, about Mexican people.  It is not gonna look like an episode of \"No Boundaries\".  Gritty urban poor?  None to be seen, or seen in context.  And that goes for all the countries.  A show shot in Malaysia by a Malaysian film crew is not going to take place exclusively among the rural poor.  I mean yes, it depends of the subject of course, but say the story is about Malaysian dogs.  Malaysian film crew gives you a show about Malaysian dogs.  American film crew is headed straight for the shittiest part of town to give you a story about dogs.  You will not see one supermarket, one sedan, one modest little house.  Nope, they're going to trek into the back of the backwoods where everyone is using old tin oilcans from WWII to cook with and shoot their dog film.My travel experience is limited. Canada, Idaho (which counts as a foreign country; Idaho is some trippy shit) Oregon, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Regular Foreign Mexico.  Yes, I like the West Coast.  We got everything here and everyone speaks the same language.  But you watch television, and if it's a travel show made by an American crew, you got your Gritty Urban Poor all over hell.  And this really bugs me.  It truly does.  You leave it up to an American film crew, every non-English-speaking country in the fuckin' world is nothing but people squatting on the dirt wearing a sarong while naked little kids toddle around among the chickens.There is some kind of fucked-up agenda going on that seems to say \"a country where English is not spoken is not foreign enough if everyone is happy and prosperous.'  So let's head to Skid Row and get down to the REAL SHIT. Because the 'real' country is the poorest and most backward part of the country.  Any country.\"I have been homeless, I have been poor, I have been reliant on public assistance.  It was a whole goddamn boatload of SUCK ASS.  At no time did I feel like I was having a jolly time, or involved in a wonderful adventure full of color and vibrance and charming rascals and astounding street food. No. There were straight-up cannibals living up underneath those twelve bridges that cross the Willamette, up in the dug-outs and the blackberry bushes.  Cannibals.  Can. I. Bals.  You died up under there with the cars going overhead, you cut your taste wrong, you had no family?  You got ATE. You got ate.  That shit was real and it happened.  It's probably still happening.  Now send a crew of man-buns and kitty-cat glasses out with some cameras to make a film about Portland, Oregon and see what they come back with.  Sure ain't gonna be about cannibalism under bridges.It's so 'Petit Trianon'!  It's revolting! And American film crews are by far and away the very worst offenders on this scene.  Greece?  It's all  po' folk in stone taverns full of hairy sweaty old guys who really do not want you to be there.  Vietnam? Show those tiny crowded alleys with the jacked up wiring all hanging from the lamp posts.  India? Head straight for the Ganges and show folks attending to their dead and that one guy with the strange white eyeball who is in every single show about India ever shot by an American film crew.It has more than a touch of 'Plantation hijinks' about it.  \"Oh, Christmas!  Let's get Miranda and Ashley and ride down the cabin row to hear the cheerful n****** sing carols!\"  \"Oh Malaysia! Nothing happens in Malaysia whatsoever except Thaipusam, right?  So lets exploit their spiritual practices for the amusement of our viewers!\"Nobody speaks up about it!  Tony Bourdain tried.  Damn that man tried. He is my hero for holding out as long as he did and saying what he said about the type of film that was being expected of him.  He said it during his shows. People heard him say it.  Even mentioned it in one of his books, a meditation, trying to get his mind around the fact that no matter what way he looked at it, he'd been forced to sell out, and forced hard and constantly, and couldn't feel right about it.  I'm not an international celebrity (much,) but I'm taking my own stand here next to him.  So one old white lady adds her voice.  I remember being SHOCKED AS HELL to see that there was actually a regular downtown Tijuana, with office buildings and men in suits and people in nice cars.  Modern houses, even mansions up in the hills.  Where did we visit?  Down in the most dangerous part of town, while our two white lady friends used their schoolgirl Spanish to try and dicker, which if you ever want embarrassing, be with your mother and two really white ladies thinking they're going to outsmart the poor, dumb locals, while the locals are calling them fat whores with smelly cunts, and they do not realize it At All.  I was seventeen when this happened.  I knew me a little 'berry picking' Spanish.  I spent a lot of time looking elsewhere.  This is a broad and bold streak of sheer aristocratic thinking going on in our media.  Perfectly accepted.  Americans really, really like to be amused at the expense of the poor.  It is so ingrained in our national character that we still think nothing of it. Don't even realize it. I mean, someone challenge me on this, or add your two cents.  To me, it feels like when Aerosmith played the Superbowl, and sang 'Walk This Way' and I was apparently the only American who realized that going out into millions of homes all over the world were the words:Backstroke loverAlways hidin' 'neath the covers'Til I talked to your daddy, he sayHe said, \"You ain't seen nothin''Til you're down on a muffinThen you're sure to be a-changin' your ways\"I met a cheerleaderWas a real young bleederOh, the times I could reminisce'Cause the best things of lovin'With her sister and her cousinOnly started with a little kissLike thisSeesaw swingin' with the boys in the schoolAnd your feet flyin' up in the airSingin', \"Hey diddle diddle\"With your kitty in the middleOf the swing like you didn't careSo I took a big chanceAt the high school danceWith a missy who was ready to playWasn't me she was foolin''Cause she knew what she was doin'And I knew love was here to stayWhen she told me to\"Walk this way, talk this way\"\"Walk this way, walk this way\"\"Walk this way, walk this way\"\"Walk this way, talk this way\"Just gimme a kissLike thisSchoolgirl sweetie with a classy kinda sassyLittle skirt's climbin' way up the kneeThere was three young ladies in the school gym lockerWhen I noticed they was lookin' at meI was a high school loser, never made it with a lady'Til the boys told me somethin' I missedThen my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favorSo I gave her just a little kissLike thisSeesaw swingin' with the boys in the schoolAnd your feet flyin' up in the airSingin', \"Hey diddle diddle\"With your kitty in the middleOf the swing like you didn't careSo I took a big chanceAt the high school danceWith a missy who was ready to playWasn't me she was foolin''Cause she knew what she was doin'When she told me how to walk this wayShe told me to\"Walk this way, talk this way\"\"Walk this way, walk this way\"\"Walk this way, walk this way\"\"Walk this way, talk this way\"Just gimme a kissLike thisOK.  So you start out with a dude masturbating.  Someone's dad tells him to put that thing in a vagina.  Or baked goods. Probably a vagina, though. So he meets a 'real young bleeder' (classy!) with a sister and a cousin and presumably fucks them all - after a kiss.  Because he's classy like that. Then he nails the neighbor girl, and starts watching the girls on the playground swings, doing the upskirt, checking out their snatches. Then a girl at a dance tells him how to walk a certain way.   I am literally the only person who found it at all odd that nobody in this God fearin' nation of ours felt that Aerosmith singing about cousin fucking during the halftime show was inappropriate at all. It's like this weird group denial thing.  \"Aw, i'wuz jest Aerosmith!\" Equals  \"Aw, thems jes po' folks, they don't care if we watch them cremate their grandma!\"So chime in.  Am I onto something or what?"},

Still outside, huh? See ya!' and go right back to shouting gibberish into his phone. My house seems to be his midway point, where he builds his rant up into it's grand peak.  He'll be out there posturing and playing to the cheap seats, declaiming and flapping away, and children, there is corn growing across the street. Corn.  An acre of corn.  I live in a town that just passed the 4 digit population mark and there is corn growing across the street and the only crackhead in town is flapping away out there, just street as hell, motherfucking and I gone smash that pussy, all shit, nigga, and...corn.Corn.There is corn. Many evenings my husband and I will be sitting here and he'll be right outside on the sidewalk, flailing and gesticulating and shouting, while his dog sits patiently and waits for him to work it out.  Then he goes on his way, still exclaiming.  It's like knowing two completely different people who own the same dog and have the same tattoos._______________________As part of the 'We're sorry' package my husband got for being told that he was going to be out of work by next....February?  June?  Who knows? he was given a $200.00 gift card.  Visa.  Spend it anywhere.  So he and I took a weekend to go to our happy place, which is Anacortes, WA.  We stayed in 'our' hotel, and ate at 'our' little hideaway, and....slept.  And hung out in our room watching television.  We each had our own king sized bed to starfish in, there was a kitchenette, and we napped, ate crap from Safeway, and napped some more.  Yes, WE know how to party.  I have never needed to get out of town so bad or had such a relaxing vacation in my life.______________________________I went out and bought myself a new hedge trimmer because I'm 60 and I get to use power tools.  I went through all the wilted stuff in the front yard like Grim Death, and now that I've got a look at what's been happening at dirt level I can lever up some stuff that's been bugging the crap out of me.  (I'm a Vita SackvilleWest follower - if you don't like it, rip it out.  And I'm rippin'.)  Now that the smoke has cleared and we've had a couple of rains, my campaign of Death is proceeding with resounding success.But the best thing?  Is that the season has changed, and it's cool enough and dry enough now at night to sleep.  This is the last year I go without an air conditioner.  Period. This winter, when they're cheap, I'm gonna get one of those little room sized ones that you hang on the wall and never look back because I'M 60 AND I GET TO HAVE AIR CONDITIONING."},

Yeah, I married a genetic male type man, the kind with a 'came in the bag all original dick and balls and likes pussy morning noon and night' situation.  How this happened I do not know.  How it lasted for 32 years I do not know.  It just happened, OK?  Anyway. I'm trying to be all 'lead by example, show the children how' but how do you do old and bi out here in the cornfields?  Every bitch looks like me!  We all are wearing barn boots and flannel and t's with the arms cut off.

Shit, half of us smoke Blackies.  That's a thing out here.  I like a cigarillo and a shot of Bushmills in the Autumn, and I set out on my porch sipping and contemplating, and all up and down the road, all the old ladies are doing the same thing!  It is not just 'Well, you get the pussy pass' because I got my original equipment and everyone thinks that all it takes is three Budweisers to turn a straight girl gay.  Some days, I am BUTCH. Lee Marvin look like a princess next to my butch.  I'm watching all those 'Amateur pole dancer SLAYS routine' videos thinking 'Me carry woman off to cave.'  Then that slews off and two days later I'm Audrey Hepburn, sighing over antique lace and Victorian childrens' books, and looking at my husband like 'you LOUT' when he doesn't open the car door for me, and I'm wearing a bra and shit.  The complicated part is the 'slews off' part.  That's when you're bi.  That's when you're what you are.It feels like a distinct thing.

We don't even have a parade. WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A PARADE.  And that's not right or fair, really.  It's like half a 'yay'.  We exist and we're important and I don't even get a....parade, or a shirt, or a symbol, or a slogan, or taken seriously.  The most definitive thing I've ever heard said about bi people was by Dan Savage, who referred to us as 'fashion disasters'.And that's fair, in my case.  I had to ask the lady at Fred Meyers to help me find the womens' shoe department - and there is a whole lot of 'wrong' in that sentence, I know - and then I ended up buying men's shoes, like I always do.So maybe this is a scavenger hunt.  First one who finds a stereotypical 'bi person' wins?  Or a bi person stereotype?  Either one."},

I mean I watched other stuff too, but I got in my three or four (or more...yeah, shit) eps a day.  It was FANTASTIC. I was absolutely pleased as all get-out.  There were a few average eps, but not a single shitty one. They did a great job making the pre- NCC-1701 technology look dangerous and substandard compared to TOS (even though you could totally tell they went to IKEA for a lot of the set details. No, I do not kid.  I am serious as a heart attack.  The X1 has IKEA elements in the set.)  Captain Jonathan Archer was a fantastic commander. The only thing that made me laugh was T'pau's amazing shrinking assets.  The first season and a half? That chick had gazongas and an apple bottom for the GODS. You could see the outline of the padded undergarment beneath her form-fitting uniform.  Season three and four, those secondary sexual attributes began to ever so slightly shrink, until she was no longer an unobtainably, sexy as hell Barbie Playboy Centerfold Vulcan-ess, to a 're-think the collagen injections in the lips hon' just folks, average, unobtainable, sexy as hell Vulcan-ess.  The surprise character standout was Dr. Phlox.

Hey, you can have more than one family credo.I have been involved in the politics of food ever since the beginning.  The Biker, not so much.When I first met the Biker, he had no clue.  He'd been living on government commodity supplies flown in every three months to the FFA base where he lived up near the Arctic Circle, where he grew up.  Koolaide? White sugar? Margarine? Bologna?  Hell yeah, bring that shit on!  Our moment of truth came when I caught him sneaking a - sit down, breathe deeply, happy place, happy place.....quarter cup of BROWN SUGAR into my pot of marinara sauce one day.  I was understandably appalled, and gobsmacked. He and I had a serious talk about food, flavor, the perception of freshness, cultural flavor profiles, and the difference between live and processed.That poor man had no clue.  No clue whatsoever! None!  You grow up on an FFA station near the Arctic Circle, they don't teach you shit like that!Now me,  I had grown up with people who believed that as long as whatever edible on your plate had been cooked to death, it was safe.  I understand where that impulse came from.  They grew up in the days before the USDA and the Health Department.  But me, I grew up in the days when you could watch Julia Child and Graham Kerr on television, telling you how to make food that actually tasted good.When I was eight years old I saw Graham Kerr make a cheese souffle on T.V.  I thought 'Well, we have eggs and cheese, that doesn't look too hard,\" and so I made that.  I made it.  It was a cheese souffle. And it really is not hard to make.  You need to separate a lot of eggs, and use an electric mixer, but it's not like fuckin' brain surgery or anything.  I presented that cheese souffle to my parents, and while my mother and her demon chorus of issues dealt with that fact, my father ate that bastard like a chainsaw going through cottonwood.I have always been the technician.  I love the industrial, mechanical aspects of cooking, the chemistry, the heat and the whole mixing of compounds.  And for all the years that my daughter lived at home I was the cook, and we ate like royalty on a blue collar budget, if I do say so myself, and I do. I was able to teach my daughter the importance of locally sourced products, and living out in the boondocks, I have access to the freshest of the fresh ingredients, and that's how she learned to cook, from me, just a suggestion here, mostly her watching and me yakking away, and then her eating the results.  She grew up into a fearless home chef, a political cook like I am, because food is politics, the politics of the worker, the stuff of life.  She absorbed the story of how food gets to the table from what we taught her and what she saw out here in farm country.Then my  husband lost his job, and was home for two years.  The aluminum plant he worked for pulled out to manipulate the price of their product worldwide, and they did it by closing down the local plant that he worked for.He could have laid on his ass getting stoned and bemoaning his state.  What he did?  Was temp work.  At food plants.We have a lot of them locally. It surprised me how many there are.  And all kinds of products, from pure protein for weightlifters to boutique chocolates.  Between temp jobs, he got caught up in the wave of daytime 'food porn' television shows.  Now my Biker, he's a big boy. Likes his carbs. Between that and Nigella Lawson, (BABY I NEED YOU) and the Fat Ladies and Tony Bourdain, he was hooked.  All he would watch was food porn.  The reason this is so bizarre to me, now, writing this, is that my Biker is all about the combustion engine situation. Suck, Bang, Blow. Cars and motorcycles. Things that go fast and burn dinosaur juice.But see, what you need to know about my Biker is that he is probably a genius. He's the smartest person I've ever met anyway, and if you can get him off the subject of fuckin' cars, he's fascinating.  Well read. Knows his shit.  Keeps us afloat financially by manipulating our assets.  You wish you had what I have, but you don't, so HA on you. This bear be ALL MINE.He watched those shows, and while I was going to college on a PELL grant, and doing temp work, he would be at home trying out those recipes with our daughter, and they'd cook together. (They also go shoe shopping together.  I don't know what that's about but they'll talk brands and materials and I just ignore it. Shoes are just foot gloves as far as I'm concerned.) This dude from the literal top of the earth, the North fucking Pole, taught himself how to cook, and he blows me away.  If he needs me for the technical stuff, I'm there, but he's the one who knows how to get the best flavor out of what he's using. It's a gift.  It's an actual gift, like perfect pitch.  He has it.  And because we all live out here where the food of America is produced, he knows how ethics, morals, politics and ecological responsibility correspond with the meals that go on American tables - shit, tables worldwide. AND HE COOKS IT.Here's my take.  Food is all about feeding hungry people.  That's what food is.  It's not about polymerized tamari on a wire, or foams, or little dabs of sauce and small pretty towers of this and that, rare and expensive.  Food is about getting the best flavor and the best nutrition and the most beneficial local effect, on the ground, out of what you eat.  That's what we do.  Here at Rancho FirstNations, food is a political act.  And when you think about it, it's one of the most basic political acts.  Feeding hungry people.  Supporting local producers.  Reducing the carbon footprint. Distributing surplus FOR FREE to your neighbors.Think globally.  Act locally.  Set a table for your neighbors.  Feed the world.________________________*We Gladly Feast on Those Who Would Subdue Us"},
{"title": "That Burning Sensation", "date": "Saturday, September 12, 2020", "text": "My home state is on fire. Oregon. I have family down there that were forced to evacuate, and now the town they were relocated to has a lightning-caused fire heading toward it.  What the fuck, universe?  Seriously what the fuck?  In August and September, it's California that's supposed to catch fire.  And yeah, it's on fire too, but that shit should stop at the goddamn border. The Northern Cascades is not supposed to catch on this much damn fire.  But it is,  because there's two years worth of old, un-cleared fire debris on the ground upon which it can feed, that and un-managed, standing beetle kill.  I've seen that shit.  Whole hillsides covered in the zombie remains of evergreen trees, the ends of the branches curled upward.  The beetles eat the cambium layer of the tree, which is the living system of the plant, and leave a sooty black tinge in the old lignin layers.  Woodworkers swoon over beetle-kill wood. I'd like to jam it up their asses.  Thank your sorry flabby ass, Trump, for fucking over the Forest Service.  If that shit had been managed, none of this would be happening.  Those damaged forests would have been selectively logged and the lumber milled and turned into a salable commodity instead of left to stand and become a death trap.The little Catholic girl who lives inside me wants to go do a Rosary service on behalf of Oregon.  She and I did one during 911 happened.  No, I'm not religious, but Catholicism is as much a way of life as it is a religion, and I was culturally indoctrinated way young.  If nothing else, I'll get to go cry in a nice, quiet place with a bunch of other sad people, which will be comforting.  As it stands I drunk dialed my psychiatrist and my daughter.  My daughter was very nice about it. I expect my psychologist to call on Monday and laugh at me, because I was pretty lit by the time I reached his message service.I do my best to choose joy each morning.  Whenever I find myself falling into one of my well-worn hate grooves I pull myself out and leave it behind.  And this has been successful. I know what I can and cannot do as far as world situations go.  But when my home goes up in flames, the most beautiful state in America...when the forests that rivaled any elven landscape of Tolkeins go up in flames, I can only mourn for what has been lost and hope that the planet finds it's own new balance in the years to come.  Well, not really, but I wish they had.  They would have done a way better job with the interior.  The upholstery was a ghastly patchwork-tweed-1970 Terra Cotta brown...pattern...situation, and it had cat box-tan vinyl interior panels set off with cat crap brown trim and plastic chrome piping.So I sold it three days ago.  Got it out of my life.  Yes, the Chevrolet El Camino 'Bone of Contention Mach 0' is gone from my life forever leaving me a few grand in hand, thank you.  I put that in the bank and went right back out and you know what I bought?A recliner.Best move I've made in a long time.  I should have done this years ago.  I can stretch out at my ease and binge on 'Star Trek Enterprise' and Scott Bacula's chest hair, and then, by God, rise and stand upright without making that 'old people' noise.  Yep, I found an easy chair that doesn't look like a Clydesdale turd, that matches my furniture, and got it On Sale, too, because I am just that good.Today I am not allowed to go outside because the air quality level is at the 'danger' level.  I haven't seen that warning since I was a little kid.  It's because just south of here in Oregon, the Cascade Range is on fire. The view from space shows a line of bright red all the way from border to border. I live hundreds of miles away, but I'm looking outside right now and the sky is a strange lurid yellow.  I can't make out the houses two blocks away.  There's a southerly wind blowing, and what was just a faint haze yesterday is absolutely dystopian today.I've had asthma since 1966.  (The doctors then told my parents I was just doing it for attention and that I'd outgrow it.  Apparently I still need my parents attention, dead lo these many years, and I'm still waiting to outgrow the shit.) I pay a lot of attention to those air quality warnings. No gardening today. No, today I'm gonna sit in my recliner and watch Star Trek and drink a Bloody Mary or five."},
{"title": "Titties and Gardening", "date": "Sunday, September 6, 2020", "text": "I was outside pretty near all day long today, the weather was overcast and mild, and I have four city lots worth of display garden to take care of.  I was doing that thing - titties safely tucked away, not on public view for once - and I overdid it. Oy!I am not going to whine about being sixty and everything's so hard now, because that isn't the case.  I have gardening in the shape of my hands, my arms and shoulders and the muscles in my legs and that's just not the issue.  I feel GREAT when I'm out working like a medieval peasant.  It's when I STOP that everything goes to hell.So I'm sitting here around a mixture of pharmaceuticals and alcohol, and I've got on old re-runs of 'Unsolved Mysteries' because I like the sound of Robert Stack's voice.  I usually write with him or Fiona Bruce narrating away in the background. It requires nothing from me, and when I look up there's usually something interesting to see.  Brian Johnson used to be part of my background noise, until his tits got me kicked off Facenbuch (FUCK YOU BRIAN JOHNSON AND YOUR SENSITIVE NIPPLES)  but once I forgive him, he'll be back.  And I'm writing a story about something that happened to me, and that's nice too.  What isn't nice is the number of thorns stuck in me. Or the fact that when I get up from this chair to crawl off and take a piss, I'm going to make that Old Person Noise.\"HNNugh.\"  Or \"FphluchAGH\".  I like to switch it up.Here in September the soil is as hard as (titties) - well, what it is; dried clay.  There's inch - wide cracks running all through the property.  I could water for a day and a night and it would only sink in about an inch, because what I'm on here is old lake bottom silt.  Fertile? Oh my God, it's fantastic stuff.  But you have to come at it planned out like Omaha Beach every year.  'Soil Amendment' ain't just pretty words to say.  Welcome, rose of my dreams!  Now you just sit there for the next hour while I toil like the Volga Boatmen getting your new home ready!  Titties!We are talking about CLAY.  (Clay's a baaaaaaad mutha -  Talkin' bout clay!  Well I can dig it!)  You see what I did there?Come Spring perennial planting here, you have to dig deeper and wider than the books would have you believe, and you have to mix in a lot of half-finished compost, chunks of branches and old grass and crap, to keep the soil light enough for the roots to spend their first year penetrating the soil as you water like a demon.  Come winter, all the surrounding soil is going to liquify and mix with that stuff, and next year, if that perennial (titties) doesn't have itself stuck in there, it's gonna bitch and complain and you'll have to jump up and down on a soil fork to loosen things up and then water with compost tea and do all sorts of bullshit all summer long while it decides if it wants to live or not.  If you can get it through that first summer, and prepare the soil correctly, you're golden.  If not, you just wasted 35.00 on a rose that's going to drop leaves and reach for the smelling salts every time the temperature fluctuates 5 degrees.Titties.My garden is finished. It has been for the past two years.  Now it's mature, and it's just a case of trimming and weeding and squashing slugs.  And in a few more years me and the Biker are going to look at one another (titties) and decide if we want to stay here, or say fuck it and  move to a smaller place.  I figure by then I'll be so stuck to this chair that we'll have to stay; or they'll have to carry me out palanquin-style, which would be very cool now that I'm picturing it. I may opt for that.So I spent the day taking things out.  Downsizing.  And I have enough specimen plants to get away with that;  I'll just scatter around (titties) some annuals to take the place of the perennial groundcover. This is the perfect (titties) time of year to do that; everything is still in full grow mode.  Next week, it's going to be a different story.  Those plants are going to start socking away the carbs in the root mass for the winter.  How do I know?  Night time temperatures.  I've been keeping track for years. You get a feel for the time of year, when the first leaves begin coloring up.  This week is going to be hammer and tongs. Hand over the aspirin and vodka, tovarisch.  Comrade FirstNations is gonna be haulin' those barges.Titties."},

{"title": "Oaks Park, 1966:  A HAPPY True Story That Happened To Me So There.", "date": "Saturday, August 29, 2020", "text": "There were a number of things on the road leading down to the river there in Sellwood.  Old wooden buildings that had held boat building works and immense empty warehouses that had once held ice cut from the frozen river in wintertime.   An old sawmill was falling to ruin on the left, and the blackberry was clawing it down into damp and rust and ruin. Here the drive split, and on a little grassy traffic island in the middle stood a small cupcake of a chapel that had been floated there from upriver, a popular  wedding venue, perfectly maintained.  To the left was the boat ramp. And finally, to the right was the entrance to a place I knew well and loved.Oaks Park.First you entered a huge gravelled lot, and in the center was the concrete and glass-block building that housed Radio KWJJ, topped by a tall, tall tower that was guyed to the hillside and the grounds.  It was sea green and shed roofed, a product of the nineteen forties, and was an on-again off-again outfit.  It’s last incarnation had been Country Western and news.  Now it stood empty, waiting for someone to come along and plug it back in. That might never happen, though. The legend ran, a dj had broken up with his girlfriend.  He went on the air and said “This one’s for you,sweetheart,” and put the record ‘I Only Have Eyes For You’. It played all night long.  Over and over.  When the morning newscaster came in, he found the dj hanging from the overhead pipes in the sound room, dead and staring.  He was still there, too, haunting the place so insistently that nobody would agree to take the night shift. That was the story. They said it’s why the station went out of business. When I was a kid I would peek in the window from our car, wanting to see a ghost.All the way around the gravelled lot ran a white picket fence. Behind that fence were small yards, shrubs, and small hip-roofed houses, a little neighborhood  set back in the trees.  It was strictly off limits.  There were No Trespassing and Do Not Disturb signs posted. At one time, it was where the park staff lived full time. Now it was overgrown and the few folks who you saw in their yards didn't look very friendly. Up ahead was the parking lot, and now you were facing a grove of immense oak trees.  Huge oak trees with straight trunks and broad, spreading canopies and a lawn beneath it all.  There were roses, walkways made of brick and all around the borders of that center lawn were placed little lattice niches, set into a surrounding hedge of laurel, rose and hydrangeas.  They were enchanting places.  Imagine a restaurant booth, a semicircle of a seat with a central table..  That was the general arrangement.  But these were framed, roofed and gated with lath lattice and woven withes and Victorian gingerbread ornaments, and at the back a special figure made of incredibly wrought wood.  One niche would be a rustic fantasy, all natural wood found on the riverbank, with smooth irregularities formed to join into curious shapes. Another would be a lathwork Eastern pavillion with a balloon roof capped with a little finial, like a small Taj Mahal.  The next would be a fairyland, and the ornaments would be bees, butterflies, and in back, perhaps a large, beautiful dragonfly, all picked out like lace.  One I remember was a spiders’ niche.  All the sides were made of joined small webs.  It was so very, very Victorian you could imagine the women in their morning glory dresses and piled-up hair, shirtwaists and plumed hats, the gentlemen with their bowler hats and canes, the children running and playing.  In the central lawn among the trees were other picnic areas dotted around, full pavilions open on the sides, big enough for eight people to sit around a table.  Each one wore a different type of roof.  An onion dome, a steep, Munchkinland eight-sided peak, a round shallow cone like a Chinese hat, one that rose in a half twist, the shingles spiralling up to the central peak. I remember the big bandstand in the very center.  It was open on all sides.  If you’ve ever seen an Andy Hardy movie, you’ve seen this octagonal building, a raised,  roofed open space where bands would play.  Sousa had played here. So had Glen Miller.There were bronze cast water fountains here and there that looked like stumps with vines clambering on them.  Each one had a small basin at the base so that dogs and birds could have a drink too.And now we come to the midway.  The bally games were first, and they were amazing places - and they were all closed, silent, dark, no more.  Just peculiar fantasies and quaint lettering, faded colors and strange faces and huge glass gems and curious shapes.  Each building was finished in the same Victorian attention to silly, beautiful details, and it was all worn now, dimming, paint peeling, green shingles blowing away.To walk through that lane of closed games was pure romance.  Pure romance.  In the evening bats would fly in and out of small gaps, wherever they could find, and it was deliciously scary, a cold draught of mystery blowing past, the rich smell of the river, the sweet smell of the blackberries.Next came the old mechanical rides, the simp twisters, and they all belonged in a museum.  I thought they were absolutely the last word in everything creepy and mechanical, with gold leaf and scrolls and pinstriping, all hand done, all fading.  Vignettes and medallions and triumphs wherever such a thing could be painted or cast, like old circus wagons.  Each one housed vast engines and creaking metal swivels, cotters, hinges, joints, gears, chains and spars.  They rattled when the wind blew.  In motion they were all chasing lights and spinning, play-dangerous motion, graceful and swift, scary and breathtaking.  Your peculiar, ancient craft would go about swinging and bobbing, with sudden halts, fast drops, screeches of metal on metal, sudden huge bursts of steam, the enormous hiss of a valve opening, the rattle, groan, and jounce of metal on worn metal. Each ride, each engine, each one had its own canvas hose, and those hoses ran down to the river.  Steam powered carnival rides, ladies and gentlemen.  Imagine it.One ride topped them all, and I’ve the only place I’ve ever seen anything like it was in an old, old silent movie.  This ride was called The Caterpillar. This is its’ story.The sign that crowned the entrance to the ride showed a nicely rendered, Winsor McCay - style cartoon caterpillar with black shoes and spats. The front of him was reared up, and he wore six pairs of neat white gloves, waving to you, gesturing for you to please, come in.  He wore a starched collar, a monocle and a top hat, had a wide, friendly face, and it was all a lie.  Mr. Caterpillar was going to make sure you never forgot his caterpillar ass. Look at it. You have a large round track, and it takes dips and hills, some abrupt, some sweeping, some caster and some camber.  The track is made out of strips of hardwood, polished by use. It’s about as wide as a standard lane on a road.  Hanging down from that track all around the outside is, of all things, a curtain. swags of fabric, like a skirt. So you have a broad, round road with a flounced skirt on, OK?In the center of this circle of wooden track a metal mast rose up.  It was bevelled, pinstriped, painted, turned and ornamented;  and about as round as a steel drum. Triangles of metal bar and pistons reached out from this mast, one triangle to each car of a row of twelve that rode on the track.  They were all squashed together when you got on, so that when you looked over at the pillar in the middle, all those rods running out to the cars looked like a narrow fan, a very pretty effect, with the pivot end at the pillar.You get into a car with some strange kid you don’t know.  It’s probably just as well because you are going to make a total freak out of yourself in a minute or so.  Now as you get into your car with your assigned stranger, you notice that fastened to the inward-facing side of your car is a fan-like contraption made of metal, like the old folding hoods on baby carriages, and like a baby carriage there’s cloth attached to it.   One metal fan in the front of your car, one on the back.  You look back and it looks like all those cars have a swag of green cloth hanging from them on the inside of the circle, loop, to loop, to loop.The ride begins, and you slowly go around the whole circle.  Slooooowly. Up and down, in and out. The wheels of the cars are rumbling on the wood deck.  You and your stranger exchange “seriously? Thi sis it?” looks.Then comes an enormous hiss of steam, and as it’s rising up around you, the cars begin to draw apart, and that fan of spars attaching your car to the central mast spreads out and it’s parts gain definition. They are covered in shock springs and swivels, gears and belts.  The distance between the cars begins to widen, and you begin to pick up speed. You can feel the wheels under your car chattering over the boards.  You just keep going faster until the cars have expanded to form a complete circle of equally spaced cars, two panicked children each. Suddenly there is a vast plume of steam! ‘FASH’!  You begin to rip around that track.  You are smashed up against your stranger, now your companion in what is probably going to be death. And you aren’t just going fast; oh no.  The cars are also tipping and tilting.  Those triangle contraptions that connect your car to the pillar are working hard, gears suddenly slipping around, belts and springs changing length and pulleys whirring.  The whole ride begins to rattle and judder like a Texas hailstorm.  The sides of the thing are jouncing.  The central pillar is jouncing. All the cars are jouncing. You can look across and see that the wheels of the cars are occasionally leaving the track.  So you are going in a circle, over hill and over dale, tipping and leaning in and out, when suddenly your car slides out right to the outside edge, and is then pulled in. This same thing is happening to all the cars, and it happens suddenly and looks random, and you are beginning to seriously freak out because you are going way too fast and too many fucked up things are happening at once.Suddenly, from beneath the track there is an enormous screeching sound, and a steam whistle blows, one long wail, and the curtain around the base of the track suddenly -FOOMP- expands, fills up with air being pumped into it in blasts, so it looks like it’s breathing.  Now it’s only as an onlooker that you get to appreciate that effect.  If you’re riding in one of the cars, you are thinking that something just went terribly wrong.You are screaming.  You might be peeing too.  Whatever you do is going to be a slave to the laws of physics, and suddenly you know you are mortal and death is real.  You are ripping around at the mercy of this whirlwind beast. Sometimes the car ahead of you is far away, sometimes you bump into each other as you close together, and a rubber bumper bashes you back apart.The Grim Reaper laughs, and pulls a lever.At your side there is a clatter and screech.  To your horror, that swag of fabric on the inner side?  Is not a decoration.  It is a covering.  It works on the principle of a fan.  That fan unfolds, comes up and over  you, and then down onto the other side, and fastens to the side of the car with a CLACK.You are in a green canvas tube now. It is dark, it is flapping and snapping, and all around you are the sounds of terrified small humans crying for their lives -And then the motherfucker lifts off the goddamn track. You see the car in front of you go up and then it’s you and you’re going up and you have tears blowing off  the sides of your face and you are holding on and begging for everything to stop. The train of cars is rising and falling, bouncing off the track hard and then leaping up again, and your vision is actually beginning to blur because your face is being blown into weird shapes by the rushing air.Suddenly the whole ride leaps.  The Whole Damn Ride Bucks Off The Ground! And then the whole covered tube of cars leaves the track!  You spin in midair like a record, silently whizzing around, gasping and snuffling, smashed so hard into your companion by centrifugal force that you feel like roadkill.  You orbit around in midair at 3000 miles an hour for a few silent moments, and then BAM you land on the track! FASH! goes the machinery of Hell!  Steam rises and blows around you, scented with canvas and fear.  All the cars bounce and clatter and leap and bash off the bumps and cambers.  You actually leave your seat and then wham back into it with each impact, and it’s serious as a heart attack.  Mercifully, someone puts on a brake.  Your motion slows.  Finally all the cars are riding around on the track at the same time, the canopy suddenly releases with a CHING-GK! and slooowly folds itself up and over and down to the other side, SNABAP!  This is when you realize that you cannot see anyone who might be standing nearby because you are still going so fast that everything is a blur.  You don’t care, though.  The ride slows, but gives you a kick every now and then.  The cars separate randomly and bash back together.  One side of the circle suddenly moves out to the very edge of the track and then is yanked back in toward the center.  You hear children crying.  One of them is you.You hear a jake brake being applied, loudly, and blasts of steam come out from underneath the ride and rise around you; then the side curtain deflates and is drawn back up into swags.  You slow, until you are just cruising around at a walk, and the rube running the ride is grinning at you as you go past with all four of his brown teeth.  Finally, finally, Thank you God, it stops with one last FASH and a plume of steam.  Abrupt cessation of motion.  It throws you forward.And the rube goes around and unlocks the little doors of the cars, and children stagger out spattered with vomit and pee, and you wobble down the stairs, and all you want in the world after all that, all you want at that very minute, is to do it all over again.  You were on the thing for close to ten damn minutes!  Most of that time near death, and unless you are ever in a small, open plane doing barrel rolls you will never feel that same kind of terror again.  Best damn ride in the entire world.  Hats off to whoever invented it.  It stunted my growth.Oaks Park was part nightmare and part daydream. It was scary and wonderful,  unsafe and insane, the best amusement park that ever was."},

Now there we go!  Roddenberry would have been so proud! Excellent in every respect, but we didn't get it on our old tired cable while it was still new, so I only caught the occasional episode. I need to be Captain Janeway's bed bitch NOW.  I'll help Seven of Nine stay warm too. I'm having one of my dyke days, bear with me.)  The rest got lost in the shuffle when our tiny little town went through the traumatic changeover from cable to fuck you, we're taking down the receiver farm.Now Mr. Internet is providing us with all the stuff I missed, and I am so incredibly pleased with the way that Enterprise is playing out.  Scott Bakula is every inch a Roddenberry captain.  It took T'pol three episodes to get the 'Vulcan' thing down - eps 1 and 2, she was just a snooty bitch.  By ep 3 she was In Charge and feeling nothing (but my hand on that ass.)  The reason I take my Trek so seriously is that I had a shitty childhood. My parents didn't deserve the name, so I, like lots of kids from dysfunctional families, took on a T.V. family as my own.I certainly didn't want what the Brady's had (except Marsha) and Mission Impossible was tuff, but there weren't any aliens or spaceships. The Prisoner was just 'sit with your mouth hanging open having your mind blown UK awesomeness.'  The Avengers was sooooooo smooth, but sadly, our Ms. Peel did end up needing to be rescued quite a bit by the always witty and resourceful Mr. Steed (I'da ridden that around the pasture!) In Star Trek (I was eight years old, remember, and desperate for role models) I found a place where women didn't need constant rescuing, intelligence was prized, men were compassionate, and 'doing the right thing' was explored and questioned.  Aliens could be good.  There was science, and space ships, and aliens, and kung fu, and robots, and Mr. Spock. There was Miss Uhura, who could take care of herself in a fight AND translate garbled transmissions.  There was the whole damn crew, and the way they interacted and made each other grow and change, which in the 1960's just didn't happen on television.  Rob Petrie was the same stumbling doofus he was at the end of the Dick Van Dyke Show as he was in the first episode.  It was like that then.  Lowest common denominator, with commercials. But Trek didn't do that.I sob like a child at the end of the movie 'Star Trek: Into Darkness' because of the dedication to Mr. Nimoy.  I'm misting up now. I saw so much of what I was going through in his struggles as Mr. Spock aboard the Enterprise... different, smart, not catching social cues, belonging to two different races that didn't respect each other very much (I'm half Native and half white) and trying to find his way with each and every interaction; worrying about his responses, and then feeling guilty for worrying, and going down that emotional rabbit hole. He too had l'tak terai, my youth was one long march through Vulcan's Forge attaining kahs wan,  I too longed for kolinhar and was denied it. HE WASN'T AFRAID TO BE SMART.  He did not dumb himself down for his crewmembers.  It was incumbent upon them to understand him, not the other way around.All that sounds dorky.  I'm a dork.  That's what we do.Now I don't go to conventions, I'm not a superfan, I don't show up and camp out on the pavement waiting for a new movie to premier.  But I know who felt like family, and little eight-year-old me made a damn good decision, I think.  A little girl with the charge to 'go boldly where no man has gone before' is a little girl who will do just that thing.  And I did."},

Huh?  Hello?So I have been helping Pet Teenager learn how to drive and I really wish her fuckin' father would pull his head out and get with the damn program.  I wasn't bitter about the situation until two days ago when we pulled in to their driveway at the same time Daddy got home from work, and he got out of his car holding a 4Loko. Yeah, dad likes to have a couple tasty beverages on the drive home from work.  Just awesome.The Biker has a party planned, just a few people from work.  And that's fine, except I haven't met any of them before, ever.  After my last venture into the social arena crapped the rug, all I want to do is cover myself in Fentanyl patches and lie in the back yard.  I don't want to clean the house, I don't want to have company over, I don't want to think up light conversational topics.  I want to lie in the back yard covered in Fentanyl patches.

A real case of 'Bitch Can't Get A Break' going on there. Eva Green is a fantastic actress and she's just wasted on this thing.  I had real high hopes for it, but too far is too far. It's like this:  The world is being taken over by the Chinese and plastic, the president is a giant vagina and I had to beg grass clippings off the neighbors to fill a hole in my back yard because grass clippings are free.  It's gonna work like a charm, though, gotta say."},
{"title": "Death and Mystery in Deepest Suburbia:  A True Story That Happened To Me So There.", "date": "Sunday, August 16, 2020", "text": "It was 1968:  a great time for seeing flying saucers.  You could not go a week without there being another report in the news.  My mother saw three, and I saw one too one night after a report on the news alerted us to the fact that a mysterious green light was to be seen travelling slowly up the Willamette River Valley.  Out into the driveway ran my mother and I, and we saw the green light, right where it was supposed to be, moving slowly southward, while my father stood on the front porch and scoffed ‘It’s just an old airplane or something. Aw, yer fulla baloney.”I wasn’t very impressed either.  I figured it was a light being towed behind a plane that was flying without lights, and maybe it was.  Hundreds of people saw it and everyone discussed the whole matter to no conclusion.  But Mom was one of those people who want to believe, and she did.There were mysteries and wonders a-plenty at our house.Now this was back when ‘What’s your sign?” was a common conversational opener.  My mother had a turn for numbers and patterns and studied astrology with great interest.  She soon became able to cast astrological charts, and manipulate all the arcana associated with that practice.  As long as I’m on the subject I should say that she was an Aquarius, my father was a Pisces, and I am a Taurus, which suits me.  In addition to being a dab hand at astrology, my mother could read fortunes; cards, palms, and tea leaves.  She had taken a correspondence course in Graphology and had learned from that to analyze handwriting and read the psychology of the writer from the curves and slants and the way the ‘t’s were crossed and the dash of the signature.  Past lives and precognition were  matters of fact.  When Uri Geller appeared on television, my mother was so electrified she sat glued to the screen, yelling for me to go through all the drawers in the kitchen and the sideboard while she watched the television avidly, yelling “Don’t forget to check the clocks!  Check the clocks!”  Because Uri, it was widely believed, could send his peculiar powers through the television set into the homes of viewers, who would end up with bent cutlery and clocks that acted peculiar.  Fortunately, we were passed by that day.  After that show there were some attempts at spoon bending made at our house.  She could make the spoon heat up - per her testimony - but that was it.  I couldn’t even do that much.  So after a week of holding spoons and stroking them like kittens while concentrating our mental energies, we gave up that exercise.  We just didn’t have the right stuff for spoon bending.One day while we were watching The Addams Family, my mother told me a very peculiar thing, in passing; that when I was an infant, she would use the Ouija board next to my crib, the little bit of me her partner, to gain help in finding lost items or answering whatever question she put to The Other Side.  “Children attract the, you know, ghosts,” she informed me.We did?Now I knew better than to press my mother on any information she might volunteer, because she would deny it.  She did not like to feel that she had given away knowledge of herself without payment,  and she would make up a new lie every time the original story was mentioned, or simply deny that she’d said any such thing.  So I sat on the couch and listened to her tell me this, and inside I was absolutely - appalled?  Weirded out?  Set back on my heels?  We’ll go with that.While she spoke to the spirit world, then, I assumedly laid there and blew spit bubbles while aethric forces directed the planchette around the board.  The fact that it did not strike her as odd or in any way peculiar that a person might not occasionally take up a Ouija board and sit next to their infant in its crib, using him or her as a small psychic pipeline, in order to summon the shades of the dead to help her find where she put the postage stamps, is what struck me then, and now, as extremely peculiar.The ouija board figured regularly in my early childhood. So much so that I would be begged to join her.  “It won’t work without you,” she’d yell.“Dad could help,” I said.“Like hell I will,” he’d snort from his Barcalounger.“Play by yourself then,” I’d say.  I wanted to go back outside.“It won’t talk to one person.  Come here and do the Ouija board with me!” she’d demand.I was probably the only kid in...miles, probably...who was ever regularly subjected to a demand like that. The first thing we’d do is recite The Lords’ Prayer.I know.Sitting facing each other, we’d balance the Ouija board on our knees, and put our fingertips lightly, lightly on the planchette.And the thing would begin to move.Did I say move?  It would skate. Shoot right out from under our fingertips.  We’d have to catch up with it. Once we all got into synch, then, it would travel around the board in swoops for awhile, just kind of enjoying itself, as my mother kept telling me to concentrate harder.“Tell me what I want to know,” she would intone.“What do you want to know?” I’d ask.“Shh.”“But how can I concentrate on it if I don’t know what it is?”“Just concentrate,” she’d say, as her cigarette burned away in the ashtray at her elbow.I remember that it would visit “Yes” and “No” a lot.  Once she had her answer, she would write something down in shorthand on a notepad, and then it was back to the grindstone. I spent hours of my childhood at the Ouija board, concentrating.  And sighing heavily.   As I grew older I began to wonder how my mothers’ wholehearted belief in the extranormal fit with her wholehearted belief in Catholic dogma. We had a holy water stoup in our living room, and a scapular that she used as a pull for the lightbulb that hung over the washing machine.  Holy cards held the place in the T.V. Guide.  We also had a nice landscape painting over the fireplace, several street scenes and some commemorative plates hung up here and there... in addition to the pictures of Jesus and Mary exposing their flaming, thorn-bound, anatomically accurate hearts floating in midair outside their clothes at chest level, as they looked at you in a very matter-of-fact way.  Flames splurted out of a little stack at the top of their hearts, and golden rays surrounded it all while the organ hovered there, dripping blood and glowing.  It occurs to me now what an awesome t-shirt that would have made, but the little Catholic girl who still lives inside me would be too horrified to wear it.As if this weren’t enough, there was a large portrait of the Pope in the spare bedroom.  I forget which Pope. He seemed like a nice man. One night  my husband and I did the deed on the carpet beneath his beneficent gaze to keep my parents from hearing the bed creak, and the fact that the Pope was watching didn’t add or subtract a thing from the experience.My mom liked the gory saints.  Sure, a martyr was a martyr, but a mystic who could levitate, and had bleeding stigmata, and consumed the cast flesh of lepers was right up her alley.  And yes, those are all real saints.  Read about St. Agatha sometime.  She was one of Mom's favorites, along with the arch grossaroni-maroni, St. Catherine of Sienna.  Here is the greatly amended and sanitized version of her story:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_SienaWhen I moved out my mother claimed my empty room as hers, and my presence there was replaced by wall to wall images of the goriest, nastiest, creepiest saints in the Catholic tradition, topped off by - this is true, every word -  a five foot tall crucifix.  I have no idea where on earth you would get a five foot tall crucifix unless you robbed a church. But there it was, where once had hung posters of Elton John, complete with Christ suffering His last agonies, depicted mercilessly. Poor emaciated Jesus, like a pitiable figure from Auschwitz, bleeding copiously and realistically from multiple places, filthy, barely clad...with his eyes firmly fixed on yours.I showed my husband during the first, and last, time that we visited.  He hadn’t believed me until that moment.  There is something about suddenly seeing a painstakingly detailed tableaux fit for the Torture Chamber in Madame Tussauds’ Wax Museum (right next to the Lebanese Hook perhaps) looking you straight in the eye when you aren’t expecting to see any such thing that will make a certain impression on a person.‘Jesus Christ,” said my husband.“Yup,” I said."},

I don't know why this is; it just is.  All summer long, people just running the fuck out of chainsaws and firing guns.  I guess it's easier to find things to saw on, like wood, or whatever you saw on, when it's not covered in snow or under two feet of water like it would be in the winter, so there's that.  And firing guns?  Generally it's a case of 'why the hell not?' when it comes to recreational gunfire.  And yes, I'm talking to you too, Canada.  You Canadians up around here are some gun-firing fools. I live five blocks from the border and I can hear you over there firing those guns you claim you don't have. HA.___________I found the best tomato IN THE WORLD!  It is the green zebra striped tomato. Yes it's a real thing. Here's a picture:  https://previews.123rf.com/images/photozi/photozi1708/photozi170800031/85102423-striped-tomatoes-green-zebra-growing-on-branch-fresh-tomatoes-grow-in-a-greenhouse-close-up.jpgDon't you dare puss out and not hit that link.  It is a beautiful picture of the tomato I mean.  This tomato tastes like, well, basically, it is perfect.  So there's that.______________OK I'm going to go back to the 'guns in Canada' issue here, only I won't be talking about Canada.  This last few years it's come to light:  over the world, everyone everywhere is tit deep in privately-owned guns.  Yes.  EVEN IN THE UK which, up until about seven years ago, claimed that there wasn't a single goddamn gun in the entire country. Not one.  Except for all the little passing mentions you'd hear various pundits pass off like 'the rise in gun crime' and 'the problem of gun crime' and 'people are blowing the shit out of each other with guns,' and then all of a sudden the UK's dirty little secret is out:  YOU'VE HAD GUNS LIKE MAD BASTARDS ALL ALONG, JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER COUNTRY ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH, AND YOU'VE BEEN KILLING EACH OTHER WITH JOYOUS ABANDON.  USING GUNS.   I've been pretty pissed off about that 'holier than thou' bullshit that the UK has been putting out for years, like  'You see, dahling, we're ahhhll civilized and extraordinarily well-educated people, and we certainly do not go about doing such untoward things because we are just that superior to you Yanks.' Yeah, bite me. It was bullshit then and it's bullshit now and it always has been bullshit.  Just because your country doesn't choose to report certain stories doesn't mean that those crimes aren't being crimed.  Ah. But then you get a couple of shit Prime Ministers and your economy goes to hell,  the BBC gets underfunded, and THEN the secret comes oozing out:  your shit is and always has been entirely and comprehensively bricked up ten deep with privately owned firearms, and you're ready to blow the first chav that comes at you into little lower-clahhhss bits if they look like they're going to use their National Health benefits._________________Another thing about the UK:  you literally cannot stick a shovel into the ground without hitting something of archaeological significance.  Your island is slowly becoming stopped in time, era by era, chunk by chunk, by the National Trust.  Right next to the Roman Wall is a Celtic Burial, near the Ruined Castle on the grounds of the Immense, Huge, Ridiculously Large Country Home on 500 acres, where the lawns have to be cut by people in period costume and I don't know what the shit.  What the shit? How do you even get a building permit?  You found Richard the Third under a parking lot!  You even have Historic Sewers!  Length of underground sewer that are protected by the National Trust!  Now me, I would have drawn the line at the Immense Huge Ridiculously Large Country Home on 500 Acres.  I would have sold off some of those acres and turned that IRLCH into apartments, because you go into any of those fuckin' places and the family is only living in four rooms of the joint while the rest of it is rotting away. Yes.  I watch a lot of BBC.  And the Antiques Roadshow UK.  I would not term myself an Anglophile per se, but back in the day my readership was overwhelmingly Brit, and that carried over into Facebook.  I don't know why.  I enjoy my UK readers a lot.  You express yourselves so well, and there is no better sarcasm on the face of the Earth than 'dry as the Sahara' UK sarcasm.  So don't think I'm ripping on you out of dislike.  I just see things, and I've had my chops busted, and busted HARD, over the years so many times by Brits because I'm American.  No, what I'm doing is, I'm just being...less than gracious now that you find yourselves in the same leaky boat as us.  And I'm getting a HUGE kick out of it, too.

And that's fine.  The man is trying.  Meanwhile he ended up with a small person with more determination and ambition in her pinkie toe than I have ever had in my life.  the kid took herself out of high school and finished her education online - by herself - she got a job here in town when jobs were hard to find - by herself - she got a bank account and a credit-limited card - by herself - and now, I'm teaching her how to drive.The kid is amazing.The first thing she did was drive us into a big hill of blackberry bushes, but she powered out of it and there we sat in the car, way, way, way back out in the country, and the whole side of the car was covered in mooshed blackberries.  That's it.  I thought for sure we were going to go down totally sideways in the ditch that those blackberries were covering and have to be towed out, because the ditches out here also channel creeks and one small river, so they're deep.  Luckily, that didn't happen.  We decided to never mention this thing.  We flip those blackberries off whenever we go by.Now we've worked our way up to drifting around what is jokingly referred to as 'town'.  She's getting used to kids darting out into traffic, big trucks, strange intersections where the vision is poor, parked cars suddenly turning out into traffic, people on their cells not looking both ways; but all at a small-town pace.  Her dad went online and found a set of stickers that say \"Please be patient:  Student Driver\" that we put on the back and sides of the car, and for the most part, people have been kind.The good thing about learning how to drive out here is that right now, harvest is in full swing.  The corn is really tall, so all corners are blind corners.  She's learning that around any given corner in the country there might be nothing but more road, or there might be a giant freaking harvester trundling along, looking like an alien death machine, taking up both lanes, and all you can do is be patient and stay well back.  There might be a crew of workers loading and transporting raspberry flats, which is an operation that looks like an open-air mining crew, with the ore carts all in a line going along like a little train with cars, only what's in those cars are huge towers of fruit flats that tip and sway even at low speed, with men ambling out into the middle of the road and forklifts suddenly appearing in the road.  Again, you give them all the room they need, you come to a full stop and you wait for them to do what they need to do, and then everyone smiles and waves as you drift past at an idle.Today we're going to go all over our driving territory and try a few new roads - one up a tall, sudden hill that has a switchback, and one down an unimproved county lane, just gravel and oil.  A few more days of this, and then we'll practice those parking skills in the lot behind the Adventist Church.It's nice to be a Grandma again."},

You want to hit Taco Bell?\" she says.See, she knows that the President of China is nuts about Taco Bell. And he agrees. And they go to Taco Bell and the President of China gets a Crunchwrap Supreme and three Party Box to go orders for his ministers and his secretary and wife and kids.Now she's wide awake.  Drops off the President of China. They do their dap run. \"Ngóh jek heidínsyùhn jòngmúhnsaai síhn\" she says, their special good-bye joke, and the President of China laughs.Cantonese.

Vern, Doris, Chuck, his other brother Chuck, and SueAnne have been breeding Covid 19 in coffee cans and wafting it across the ocean so that China would get the blame.\"Well would have, if it hadn't have been for those darn kids,\" says Doris, and three kids with a box fan and a long extension cord sneak away into the forest.  Everyone gets sent to New Mexico to stay in detention camps, and since they can't speak fluent English, the guards buy this readily. Jistanelleni, of course, has set fire to the operation, and stands there as the flames billow, hands on her hips, glorious.  But extreme heat and vinyl don't mix, so she does this just long enough for everyone to get a picture on their Smartphones, and then off she goes. Headed East. Flying just over the waves. Sees some whales. \"Hey, whales,\" she says.  She has time to kill, and China is a beautiful place.  So is the rest of Europe.  She loves that Autobahn, man.  Passing cars right and left.Jistanelleni tells OnStar to order a dozen red roses and have them delivered to her penthouse, so they'll be the first thing Serena sees when she wakes up. \"Put \"J'taime\" on the card,\" she says.  French. She speaks it fluently.\"There she goes,\" says a French dude in his striped shirt and beret a she goes cruising past in her badass McLaren. \"La belle fantastique.\"\"That was nice of you to say,\" she replies, because she's polite. He picks a single rose and tosses it to her, one hand over his heart.On her way across America, taking some backroads, she runs into a protest in North Carolina.  \"Of course it would be North Carolina,\" she thinks.  There on one side of the street is the Westboro Baptist Church, the Klan and a fair scattering of anti vaxxers, Pro Lifers, Maga Hatters and general fools all screaming themselves silly.  On the other side of the street is a Vietnamese psychiatrist sitting at a bus stop.  She seems puzzled.Now Jistanelleni sees this poor woman waiting to get on the bus and she knows that anything is liable to set this mob off and make things difficult and tie up traffic, so Jistanelleni does the smart thing.  She goes to the nearest grocery store and buys a lot of hot dogs and then drives past the noisy group in her flashy car very slowly, with the good smell of all those hot dogs wafting out over the crowd.  Our gal J hands out all the hot dogs those people can eat, and they all get the protein yawns and go home to take a nap.  She drives the psychiatrist to her office.  They eat hot dogs on the way.  She's generous. Everybody enjoys a good hot dog.  She didn't cheap out, either - went with the Hebrew National Beef Franks.On the way back home she stops to demolish the Westboro Baptist Church as long as it's just sitting there empty.  Does that thing Run Run Shaw style.  Kicks that place apart. Bam! Smash!  She's slinging bricks through windows and throwing pews around like matchsticks.  All the neighbors gather 'round and cheer her efforts.\"You're too kind,\" she says.  \"Thank you.\" And she is so touched by their gratitude that she composes a musical tribute on the spot.  Reaches into the back of the McLaren, gets out her double-necked Fender, plugs it into the sound system and rocks the neighborhood so hard that everyone becomes friends, and they rock out for eight hours. All the lawns turn from brown to green. The police show up, and they get rocked so hard that they join in.  They even sing backup while the mayor takes the lead during the finale, a dazzling and innovative re-imagining of 'The Ghost Of Tom Joad'. \"My work here is done,\" she thinks.  As she drives away, everyone is singing 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. \"Damn,\" says the chief of police of Westboro.  \"She was one foxy woman.\"\"That was Jistanelleni Despochadalf  Theron - Musically Talented, Violent, Foxy Genius,\" the mayor says.  \"She can't help it.  I patterned my personal foxy on her foxy.\"\"It shows,\" says the chief of police, and they hold hands.By the time Jistanelleni gets back to her lavish penthouse Serena is awake, putting the roses into a breathtakingly beautiful mid-century Finnish art glass vase. \"It was so sweet of you to let me sleep in,\" she says.\"I brought you Starbucks,\" says Jistanelleni.  \"Americano, light crema.\"  Hands it to Serena, who is completely charmed by this thoughtful gesture.Needless to say, after the coffee is gone, and after a shower, and a nap, they spend the rest of the day making acrobatic, insane, funky love and  fall asleep in each other's arms.Just another day in the life of Jistanelleni Despochadalf  Theron - Musically Talented, Violent, Foxy Genius."},

So like I said, not such a bad place.“You gonna be OK here by yourself?” Mike asked me.I hadn’t slept in 48 hours.  Mike had been good enough to sit with me and talk, and drink some.  Just when I thought I could get some rest, the shivers would hit me again.  “I’m fine.  I know I am.  My body doesn’t believe it yet.”“Well, you think about it. I can call it off if I have to.  They’ll still have a party without me, just not as good,” he said, smiling.“Where you going?”  I asked.“The Red Ace,” he said.  Mike had a light and sound set-up,  and he made pretty good money at it, gypsying around, working for bands and venues and private parties. “Remember that place? I took you there years ago.”“Holy shit, Mike, be careful,” I said.“I will do no such thing,” he grinned. “OK then, I’ll let you go, and just...well, this is going to be weird.”  He sighed, looking embarrassed. “But has to be like this because of my mom. So, just, don’t turn on any lights, or the radio, or the T.V.  I’m sorry, I know it's weird.  Don’t make any noise, and don't go outside.  Gawd. If my mother thought there was a woman out here she’d spit up blood.”I laughed. “She’s protecting your virginity, dude!”   He rolled his eyes.Mikes mother and I were not each others favorite person. Back in high school I’d dated her baby boy for about a year, on and off.  I had no idea what her damn problem was. I'd been perfectly nice to the woman, but she had evidently decided not to like me and that was the end of it.Mike was lucky enough to live in a nice little mother-in-law cottage on the same lot his parents owned, 1950’s all the way, with two bedrooms.  His rent was practically nothing.  I kind of hoped that Mikes’ family would let me stay in that second bedroom, which was dumb, but you never know.  I could pay a few months rent up front.  They didn't have to like me.Around nine in the evening I was lying on the couch reading a Rolling Stone by the light of a candle, with a bourbon and branch water nearby, when someone knocked on the door. I could see through the net curtains enough to make out some huge dude standing there under the porch light, and that it was not Mike’s dad.  I just laid there and read.“Mike!” said an insistent voice.  “For Heavens sake!  Mike!  Let me in!”  the voice said pettishly.Aw fuck I knew this guy!  But Mike wasn’t home, and I wasn’t supposed to be here, so I continued to page through the magazine.The knocking and nonsense went on for another five solid minutes. I was glancing up at the clock in the dinette, watching the minutes tick by.  He just would not stop.  When five minutes looked like it was going to turn into ten, I went and stood next to the door.  “You better get in here fast as soon as I open  this door,” I said loudly.  “I mean fast like a magic trick.”To his credit he did, and I closed the door behind him quickly.“Well! Royce? Hello! I haven’t seen you in awhile,” he said.“Man, you look exactly the same. I love it, ya fuckin' hippie! Rainbow suspenders, you still got the ponytail and the octagon glasses and moustache and jungle creepers and everything! Wow, Jim! I haven’t seen you since 1970 something!  Are you still up on Harrison?”He sat in one of the side chairs. “No, because my idiot of a father decided to tear the place completely apart and remodel it.  It's a disaster. He has no idea whatsoever how to go about it.  It’s a disgrace.  It’s a wreck.  Melvin and I were doing just fine there. We had jobs, we were keeping the place up, and then he got this bee up his butt.  It’s a complete fiasco up there now,” he said. “An utter and complete fiasco.”Now Jim was in possession of a beautiful speaking voice, and he had an expository, enunciated way of expressing himself. Even when he was talking pure hippie horseshit, it was fascinating. It drew you in,  and you listened.“So where are you now?” I asked.“Back home,” he sneered.  “Ho ho, but not in the same house. No.  I put my foot down on that.  I built a place in the back yard and that’s where I stay.  I absolutely refuse to sleep in the same house as those people.  Of course Melvin is back in his old room.  He’s glad to be back, naturally.  It’s repulsive.” Melvin's bedroom had been the garage since shortly after he’d gone through puberty, because puberty had caused Melvin to sneak around the house at night being gross.  The way his father solved that problem was to close the roll-down door of the garage, nail it shut, and lay down some indoor-outdoor; and so what had once been an attached garage, laundry and half-bath became Melvin's special domain, and to make sure it stayed that way, his parents actually locked the connecting kitchen door every night so he couldn’t ‘accidentally wander’ into the main house. Whenever it rained, worms crawled in underneath the rubber thing on the bottom of the garage door and died on the sodden carpet, which squished all winter. In between the Playboy centerfolds, black mold climbed the walls.But no pity was due. Melvin fit right in. This was his ecosystem. Melvin was everything his unfortunate name promised and so much more. I wouldn’t sit next to him in the car, on a sofa, in a restaurant booth, on the porch, anywhere within reach. And as almost goes without saying, he worked nights as a janitor in a grade school.  Just because it’s a stereotype doesn’t mean it never happens that way.“I was looking for Mike,” Jim said.  “Where’s Mike?”“He has a thing in town.”“Oh.”After a few moments it was clear that Jim was not going to pick up the conversational ball, and that he was not going anywhere.  And I couldn’t make him go anywhere either because he was the size of a Buick.“Hey,\" I said.  \"I should tell you, please don’t let on to anybody that I’m here.  I had to leave Portland in a hurry and I’m kind of hiding out here.  Seriously, Jim. Nobody.”His eyes got big.  “Seriously! Well my goodness, of course.  What happened?”“My boyfriend.  You know.”  I really didn’t want to talk about it.“Well what happened?” he repeated.“I really don’t want to talk about it,” I said.“You should talk about it.”“I’d rather not.”“Are you pregnant?” he asked.I was about to go off when I recalled that Jim, although older than Melvin, had been raised by the same people.“Good Christ no,” I replied.“That's a relief,” he said.“I agree one hundred percent, dude.  So.  Hm. Where are you working?”He snorted.  “At 431 Harrison Avenue,” he said with courtly indignance. “My father the imbecile pulled me off my job at Molalla Cold Storage to help him with his idiotic remodel project. I get room and board and that’s it.  It’s positively feudal. An absolute disgrace.”“Woooow,” I said.It was a wow with many levels.  Jim towered over his father.  I had seen Jim lift and carry an engine block like it was nothing.  He was 23 years old, and very possibly a genius.  And yet his father had pulled him off the job?  I could only wonder how that went down.  Did the old guy march in wearing his Darigold whites and little peaked cap and demand his son be brought to him?  It was possible. Entirely possible. Mr. Fields was a very freaky little fat man without a shred of shame, or sense.“Well I came over to see if Mike wanted to come up to the house and give me a hand,” Jim said.  “I suppose it can wait until tomorrow.  My idiot of a father put his big stupid foot through the ceiling when he was up in the attic walking around on the rafters.”I snorted and grabbed a pillow to laugh into.  “Shh, shh,” I gasped.  “Oh my God!  Oh that is not funny!  I’m sorry!”“It is too funny,” Jim grinned.  “He’s at home now with an ice pack on his nads.  He landed like a fork, bam! full weight on the rafter, bag first.  The thing’s swelled up like a grapefruit.”I was sliding down off the couch laughing into my pillow.  “No!” I said gleefully.“It’s lucky he did or we’d have a bigger hole in the ceiling,” Jim said.When I’d gotten control of my self I found that I was still stuck with how to deal with this man.“Well, I don’t think there’s any food or I’d offer you something,” I said.  “So-”“Oh don’t bother, I’ll take a look,” he said, and off he went.  I looked after him and then just sat back down with my Rolling Stone.After clattering around for a few minutes he came back out with a sandwich and a coffee cup. He sat and proceeded to go through his snack like a buzz saw, and then put the dish and the cup on the floor. “Well, I’ll be getting along.  You should come by one day and see my cactus.  I’ve got some peyote capped up too, and I’m holding if you’re interested.”  And with that he was out the door and gone.I picked up the dishes and went into the kitchen. The bread was lying open on the counter and I put that away.  I turned back to grab the cutting board, and then I saw the open jar of mustard, scraped dry, and the empty bottle of worcestershire sauce.“He didn’t,” I said.“He did,” Mike said later that night. “I’m lucky there’s anything left in here at all. Him and Mel both do this shit. They’re like locusts. Just help themselves. Of course if I had to put up with what their mother throws at them I’d eat mustard sandwiches too.”“Never met the woman,” I said. “Met the dad a couple times.  He was a damn treat. I can only imagine what he married.”“No you can’t,” Mike said, and gave me a look.It was around two in the morning. Mike opened up the hideabed for me.  “Oh!  I forgot to mention.  If you have to, you know, have your ex beat up, that can happen,” he said with an eager smile.Every time I thought of the guy I’d left, a hot rush of terror would go through me. But that was more because of the drastic step I’d taken, and the fact that my life had changed so profoundly in such a short time. “You are awesome,\" I said, and I hugged him.  \"But nah. Don't worry about it.  Believe me, Dan’s the worst possible thing that could happen to himself. But the fewer people who know about me, you know, being here, and not with him? the better. The way my luck has been running, my parents would get wind of me, and that would be worst, worst thing that could happen at this point.”“Oh my God.  But your parents just live down the way,” Mike said, and put his hand on my knee.  “You didn’t say anything to them?  I wondered why you called me.  What’s wrong?”“This shit would make their whole day, man.  They would gloat and scream and yell and call everyone and tell them what a whore I am and how I came dragging my tail home, and I don’t need that shit,” I bitterly replied.  “They were nice in front of you, of course; you were company.  But you weren’t their kid.”“They’ve got to be worried,”  he said skeptically.“No. You don’t know what it was like. Eighteen solid years, every day.”“I kinda figured there was something uptight happening when you kept telling me yeah, wear your cowboy boots, wear the Wranglers, yeah, wear the pearl button shirt, talk about guns,” he smiled.  “I thought ‘Well that’s strange.’  You always made such a big deal about it every time I was going to come by.”“Hey, they liked you,” I said.  “You're a good guy. And that shitkicker getup really tied the bow on top. Man, my dad was sold. He kept hinting about 'Whatever happened to that nice fella that worked at that Ardenwald Cowboy Show?”“So you didn’t tell them I suck dick,” Mike said.“I promise you I didn’t tell them you suck dick,” I laughed.  \"Just about the Cowboy Show.\"“Because I thought that was an issue at first, but then you’d be up on the dance floor with the boys being all cute and and adorable.”“I have never been cute and adorable,” I said.  “I was dignified and classy.  Like when I'd take off my shirt and dance bare titty with all the guys in their assless chaps and harnesses.  Shit, that was in the Kachina Lounge.”  I mused for a moment on the passage of time.Mike was still taking it in.  “I mean I could tell your dad was a drunk.  I mean no question about that, Gawd.  You could smell it on him all the time, and then there were the gin blossoms and shit.  Your mom seemed nice though.  She was a little on the religious side, but she was OK...” he shrugged.“That nice shit would not have lasted, trust me,” I replied. “Mike, my mom is  not a little religious.  She has a mental problem.  OK this is messed up but listen, it's the truth, OK? She turned my old bedroom into a shrine to the Crucifixion. Sound crazy?  It is, dude. But I've seen that shit.  I am not lying to you. There is a whole lot I didn’t tell you because it was so messed up and weird and embarrassing.  I didn't tell anybody.\"Mike shook his head.  “I knew something was up though. You weren’t a very happy person back then.”“Well fuck it,” I sighed. “That’s done now.  I put it behind me and it’s going to stay behind me.”________________________________________I went into Portland and applied for unemployment insurance, and then I bought a copy of the paper and started looking for work.  Just keeping an eye on what was going on, not seriously. And this is why:   I had a little money saved, and I was going to squeeze all I could out of my unemployment checks for awhile, because after the last two years I’d gone through? my ass deserved to take a fuckin’ holiday on the state.  Your tax dollars at work.I woke up the next morning to another knock on the door.  I ran back and woke Mike up. He wandered out in his birthday suit and took a peek through the eyehole. “Oh Jesus it’s Jim,” he whispered.  “I’m gonna go take a shower.”“Should I let him in?”“You better, or he’ll stand right there and pound on the door for hours,” Mike sighed, and ambled off.I was still wearing the clothes I’d been wearing for the past two days, and my hair was a wreck, but it was Jim;  so I opened the door.  As he entered, Melvin suddenly appeared and came in right on his brothers' heels.“My goodness, look at you,” Jim said.  \"You're a  mess.\"“Thanks, Jim.  Hey, go ahead and set down you guys.  Mike’s in the shower, he’ll be out soon.  Hi Mel!  Been awhile, huh?”“Do you have any coffee?” he asked.\"Nope, we just rolled out when you knocked.”Melvin snickered at that.  It was a dirty, creepy snicker, too. Suddenly, time past stepped out of the way and there was the Melvin I remembered, still trailing slime, all clumsy, creepy, dirty-minded insinuation.I turned my back to them deliberately and began making up the hideabed.If there was one thing I was good at, it was making beds.  I’d been working as a maid for three years by then, and if you needed something cleaned, I was your girl. I’d seen some shit too, let me tell you. And having seen some shit I was all the more aware that I was in a very small room with a very large weirdo and a smaller, weirder weirdo. And I was pissed off because I was still sleepy so I took my time pulling the sheets and blankets tight and making all the corners extra neat.“I could make coffee,” Melvin said.  “I’ll just go look for the, you know, the stuff.”“Hang on.  Mike’s going to be out of the shower soon.”“But I want a cup of coffee,” he whined.“I’d like one too,” Jim declared.“Well just hang on,” I said, and slowed up a little more.“I just got home from work.  This is my after hours,” Melvin announced. “I saw the door open and I thought, I thought well, he won’t mind, and wow.  Yeah, I work nights...yeah, I work all during the night, for the school district, did you now that?  Make eight dollars an hour, union wages,” he said proudly.“No you most certainly do not.  After they take out the taxes and other fees you make a little less than seven dollars an hour,” his brother said, lordly and detached.“Well...well, I still make eight dollars an hour, that still counts, I just, I’m a working man. I make eight dollars an hour.\"\"Total, not net,\" Jim said.“Well...you’re an asshole.”“Yes I am,” Jim said. “I’m an asshole.”“Yes you are.  You’re a fucking asshole.”“And I agreed.  I heard you the first time.”\"Fuck you, ya asshole.\"\"Yes. Fuck me. I'm an asshole.\"\"Well, well fuck you.\"It was traumatic.As I was slowly folding the couch Mike came out with a towel around his hips. “Well look at the crowd in here,” he said.“Go make some coffee, huh?” Melvin said.“I had to stop drinking coffee.  I have a bleeding ulcer,”  Mike sighed.“I’ve got an Ayurvedic cleanse you could use,” said Jim.“I didn’t realize it until just lately,” Mike explained. He looked back at me and crossed his eyes.Just then someone else knocked on the door.  “Oh now what,” Mike sighed.  He looked out the peep-hole, and then turned to us and grinned.  “It’s the Jehovahs you guys,” he whispered.  “Shh.  Now don’t freak out.”He opened the door wide, and all of us looked at both of them, two young men in suits and ties, holding Bibles. “Good morning,” said the taller one.  “We were wondering if you’d ever thought about why the world is so troubled and what you can do about it.”“Sure have,” said Mike, and dropped the towel.  “Come on in.”They didn’t.“OH GOD!” shouted Melvin, and his brother gave him an elbow, hard.“Shut up your imbecile,”said Jim.“Well I just, I just saw a mans dork there!” Melvin was halfway turned around in his chair, cringing and flapping his hands. “I wasn’t expecting to see a big old hairy, old, you know, dick and balls in my face, you know!  That was disgusting! Disgusting!”“It was fuckin’ hilarious,” I gasped, laughing into my pillow.  “Oh my God did you see the look on their faces?  I thought I was gonna die!”“Never say that,” Jim told me.  “If you call on Death, he hears you.”“I’m just gonna go.  I'm gonna go then, and, and get some rest. I work all night.  I need my rest,” Melvin announced, and away he stomped.“Never invoke the name of Death in vain,” Jim said.  I wanted to tell him that he’d just done it twice, but I really didn’t want to encourage that line of conversation.Mike finally came back out, fully dressed, and sat on the end of the sofa.  \"So what’s up?”“The old man put his stupid foot through the ceiling and he’s laid up,” Jim said.  “I need someone to help me patch the plaster.  All you’d have to do is spot me.  If I fall off the ladder up there alone nobody will notice I’m missing for hours.”“Well….” Mike said.  “Hang on.”  He went into the kitchen and looked out the window.  Then he returned.  “OK my parents are gone.  You’re invited, Royce! Come on with us,” he said, very pointedly.  I got the hint.“Sure!” I chirped._______________________________The last time I’d been in the house on Harrison Street had been while I was still in High School, and it had been an amazing home, stopped in time. You could tell that the last time someone had bought anything new had been around 1940.There had been actual Maxfield Parrish prints framed in gold that hung on long heavy silk cords from the picture mouldings.  There had been oriental fringed rugs, a tiled fireplace with poppies and acanthus leaves, a quartersawn oak hardwood floor and beautiful Mission light fixtures and details.This had been back when Mike and I had been dating.  He’d stop by and get a little weed for the evening, and while he did business  I wandered around and looked at it all, avoiding the Fields brothers as much as I could because you could just feel the weirdness emanating from them.Until the evening I found the spare bedroom door opened.I’d never seen anything like it.  From floor to ceiling, the room was entirely lined with paperback science fiction and fantasy books. I read the titles and was absolutely impressed.  My resolve broke down.  After that, whenever we visited, Jim and I would fall to discussing the Grey Lensmen and H.P. Lovecraft, and the Burroughs Mars versus the Ray Bradbury Mars and other crucial subjects like that, just getting along like a house afire, while Melvin interjected “I don’t read that garbage. That stuff is just, it's just garbage. I don’t read garbage.”One evening, Jim paused and shot Melvin a look.  “I found all the porn you stole from Dad in the garage,” he said loftily.  “All his Foto Fillies*.  I’d say it’s apparent that you'd rather not read at all.”Melvin kind of spidered in upon himself like Gollum and pouted and glowered.That was the first time Mike and I had ever shared what we came to call the ‘Fields Response,’ which was a secret glance you exchanged; and your eyebrows were way up by your hairline.Now that beautiful house was empty. All the fixtures and appliances were gone. All the windows had been taken out and laid against the walls.  All the oak mouldings and other beautiful features had been removed.“What the fuuuuuuck?” I said as I entered, looking around.“My father decided to modernize.  Can you imagine it. Aunt Audies beautiful house. He just threw out all those beautiful old Mission touches, the pictures on the walls, the built-in glass bookcases that were here, the furniture and everything, straight to the dump. It’s a disgrace. An absolute disgrace. It was perfectly sound the way it was.  But no!  I was so angry.” “So where’s the hole?” Mike asked.Jim lead him into the kitchen and told him the story, which had Mike whooping and gasping for breath, which got me started laughing again.“It’s the best thing that’s happened to this house since this entire stupid project started,” Jim declared.  “I might be able to get a few things done now that he’s laid up.”Fixing the ceiling turned out to be a fairly quick job.  Jim just climbed the ladder and poked the lath back up into place; and then splodged some sheet rock filler over it.“Is that going to work?” I asked doubtfully.  It was already beginning to sag.“Oh, it doesn’t matter,” Jim said airily.  “If my father is intent on turning this into a dump, then far be it from me to deviate from the standard.”“Oh hey! Pat’s back from Spokane,” Mike said.  “I saw her last night pulling in.”“Oh good!” Jim said.  “I'll go over and see her!”“Well, no, wait now Jim. Let her sleep, geeze. You know, she got in about the same time I was crawling home,” Mike said.“Oh she won’t mind,” Jim declared. “I’ll take the truck.”“O…..K then. Royce and I are going to go hit the Seven Eleven,” Mike said, and pulled me out the back kitchen door after him, hurrying right along.We walked quickly up the street and then Mike took the next left.  “Whats this about?” I asked.  “We can’t just walk straight up Harrison to 42nd?  The shortest distance between two points?”“I don’t want him to see us and ask if we want a ride,” Mike said. “Gawd I wish I'd kept my mouth shut.  Poor Pat.  OK, this isn’t going to make sense, but just...Jim thinks that it impresses Pat that he owns his own vehicle. I’m serious.  She lives two blocks from that house and he takes the truck to see her. And if he sees us he’ll slow down, right in traffic, and pace us while he insists we jump in. This has happened to me! A lot! Quit laughing and listen, this is serious!  There's no way I'll ever get into the the inside of that thing .  That’s enough to make a buzzard puke.”“It looked OK to me,” I said.   The truck was just an old five-window. Nothing spectacular.“It’s had Fields all over the seats,” Mike said.  “Particularly Mrs Fields, oh my God in Heaven no.  And Old Man Fields. Forget Melvin. And Jim? Gawd no. It’s full of Concentrated Fields butt.” “Wait. Explain the part about owning his vehicle. He thinks the truck is going to...?”  I didn’t finish the thought. These were Jim Fields’ motives I was about to question.  There would be no rational answer.  “What the fuck is up with these people?”We were walking past the little church where my father had been baptized, a small brown building with a steeple set in amongst a graveyard overgrown with lilac, and surrounded by a white picket fence in need of some attention.“Hell, who knows?  They just appeared like mushrooms. OK.  I’ll tell you a story, and you have to promise you won’t spread it around.”“Not a problem,” I said.  “C’mon.”“Well.  When I was in grade school, mom had a - oh look, apples!  Those are Green Transparents!  I want to pick some.\"We tucked in our t-shirts and stepped close to the fence, picking the apples and dropping them down the neck-holes of our shirts.“Now this was years ago.  My moms hosted a Rena Ware party, which is the same basic thing as  a Tupperware party, only it was this whole set of steel cookware.  And the Fields had just moved in, and being neighborly, you know, cordial, my mother invited Mrs. Fields to attend. Now imagine for a second how our front room is set up, how everything opens off the front room.  Got it?”I nodded.“OK. Well the poor lady has her stuff all set up on the coffee table, and she's showing the stuff off and going through her spiel. All the ladies are in nice dresses and they have their jewelry on and they’re all drinking coffee, and it’s, you know, a nice, proper afternoon do, sitting on the couch with the side chairs pulled up close. Well. Mrs. Fields got up in the middle of it.  Didn’t say excuse me, just barged straight through the middle of this poor lady showing off her cookware -  and she went into the bathroom.  Yeah.  The one right off the living room. The one the couch faces.  And she left the door open!  So she could hear!”“Oh my Goooooood…..” I said, horrified.  That bathroom was right there on the opposite wall!  It would have been like a stage.  I could imagine how that must have gone over, and I started to laugh again.“No wait, now.  She sat there on the toilet, yanked up her dress around her waist, and, and, shut up now you’re making me laugh too. She sat there and she took a dump!  Yes!  She took a dump! No holds barred! And then she just stood up and wiped her ass. Right...there! Framed! Like a work of art!”  He gestured, squaring his hands so we could enjoy the framed view.  “And then just swanned back in!”We were sitting on the curb laughing.  “Did she flush?”  I asked.Mike gave me a look.  “Guess.”______________________________________________When Mikes' parents got home, we were summoned into the Presence. Mikes’ father was the kind of man who let the old lady deal with the heat.  Nice guy, just not into conflict.  He was in the kitchen rattling around.Mikes' mother was what the Victorians used to call ‘a formidable matron’; and she regarded me without the least bit of interest whatsoever as Mike and I stood in the living room.I was crisply informed that I could not sleep in the rental cottage.  That did not look right.  But she understood I was in a difficult situation.  They had another place where I could sleep, but only for a couple of weeks until I found an apartment.And that is how I, with no more shits to give, ended up living in a metal garden shed on the back of the Sherholz’ property.We got me all situated, and then Mike handed me a Schlage combination lock, and told me to use it on the inside of the doors whenever I was sleeping there.  He had even drilled holes into the handles to put the shackle through.“Are you real? This used to be such a nice place,” I complained.“You didn’t grow up one door down from the Fieldses,” Mike said.  “The only one of them you can trust is Jim, and who knows what he’s going to do next. At least he’s just weird, not gross. The rest of them, NO.  Melvin and his father, no.  No no no.  And for Gods sake do not let that woman anywhere near you.  She’s, I don’t know what. Augh.”  He shook his hands off, like he was shaking off something disgusting that had splashed onto them.I learned pretty quickly that the one you had to watch out for was Melvin.  He was a snoop, a sneak, a creep and a shit-stirrer.  It’s how I ended up in a metal tool shed instead of the nice little cottage - he’d run home angry because he didn’t get his coffee and told his mommy, and mommy had told daddy, and daddy had called Mike’s father and let him know that his son had a ‘Shack Job’ living in his rental.Now this being the late Seventies, I’d been called a lot of things by a lot of men and boys.  But the old guys, the ones who served during WWII, that fuckin' generation, the ones that grew up being beaten with splits of firewood and walking 15 miles to school uphill both ways in the snow, seemed to  be unanimous in their choice of ‘Shack Job’ when it came to calling me out of my name.  I was not a slutty person.  I knew a few things about what was going on during the war years.  Being called a Shack Job failed to have any effect on me whatsoever, but it spoke volumes about the old men who used the term. You could practically hear their salivary glands working.So here I was in a metal garden shed, forbidden to go into the cottage where Mike lived without permission, forbidden to go into the main house without permission and someone from the family standing right there with me, and me?  I was OK with that.The last straw with Dan was still fresh in my memory. He’d suddenly jumped up from the couch and come at me with a corkscrew.  I don’t remember what the issue was.  We didn’t even drink wine, so I don’t know where the corkscrew came from.  But one minute he was sitting on the couch, and the next moment I remember that corkscrew coming toward me fast. I stepped aside as he lunged; and he caught the coffee table across the shins, slid across the top and landed flat on his face on the floor.Frozen with shock isn’t just an expression.  For a moment I couldn’t move, I couldn’t breathe, I went cold as ice.Then I gave him a once over and decided that since he seemed to be breathing, I’d let him rest where he was.  I stepped over him, took the corkscrew out of his hand, out the window that went, and I started calling people.A couple of hours later he suddenly started heaving himself up from the floor. He may not even have been conscious.  I watched as he crawled into the hallway.  He fumbled at the doorknob and went staggering out into the street.  He’d be gone for a couple of days.  It’d happened before.Three hours later me and a garbage bag full of clothes and small possessions were on the #36 bus, headed back to Milwaukie, Felony Flats South. God bless you, Mike Scherholz, and all who sail in you.So yeah.  Compared to that, my metal garden shed was a step up in the world.With the front and back doors wide open and all the curtains drawn aside so that any formidable matrons watching could see that Mike was not canoodling with the Shack Job, I was sitting at the kitchen table cutting up the apples while Mike made pie dough.  “So was he drunk or what?” Mike asked.‘Or what,” I said.  “I had no idea what Dan was into.  He just got worse and worse.  Like, I found out that he’d quit his job two months after he’d quit, for starters...yeah.  He’d been pretending to go to work every morning.  Didn’t say a word to me.  I have no idea what he was doing all day.  He’d come back home in the evening with his restaurant clothes on, get high, watch television…”  I shrugged.  “I just watched him change all that second year. Out of nowhere he’d come up really, really intense and out of it. And mean. And violent.”“You should have called sooner,” Mike said, turning to me, looking upset.“No, I made the decision to try and stick it out.  It’s true what they say.  You blame yourself and you think that if you just behave a certain way it’ll fix it.  I gave it a year.  It didn’t get fixed. I left.  Anyway,” I continued, carrying the bowl of cubed apples over to the counter, “I’m going to have to find someplace else to live before November.  And it’s going to have to be in closer to Portland City Center than here if I’m going to get work.  I’m bussing it now.”“Oh TriMet, what would we do without you,” Mike said.  “Hey listen, though. Do NOT. Do. Not. Let Melvin or Jim think that transpo is a big deal for you, or they’ll be all over you offering you rides.  I mean, if it's an emergency you can ride in the back of Jim's pickup, but never, promise me now, never ever get into the car alone with Melvin.”He put a stick of butter into a saucepan and let it heat on the stove.  “I hate to tell you this, but since you’ve been here I’ve caught Melvin in our back yard twice.  First time I said “Hey there Mel, you OK?” and he freaked out and said he was looking for their cat. Mm, maybe.  But twice?  No.  Now pussy…”I threw a piece of apple at Mike. “Don’t be gross.”“You make sure you use the God damn lock, \" he replied. “Melvin used to sit under Jeanette’s window at night and jack off.\"My expression set him off laughing.\"Oh yes, really.  She caught him!  Oh, it was great,’ he chuckled. “She snuck out of her room and went in and told Dad, and he came and checked and sure enough, there’s Mel whacking away in the ferns. So Dad snuck out the back door and turned the fuckin' hose on him!”After we finished laughing, Mike turned back to the stove.  \"He's lucky I didn't kick the shit out of him that night. Dad wouldn't let me.\"“Hey, where is Jeanette lately?” I asked. Mikes' sister hadn’t been my favorite person, but she was tolerable.“Oh, Jeanette did good.  She found herself an oil sheikhlet and he’s got her set up in an apartment downtown in the Portland Towers,” Mike replied, stirring the butter, apples and sugar, sprinkling in a little cinnamon, a little vanilla a little nutmeg.  “She got into the disco thing and it paid off.  I mean she had those guys buying her diamond jewelry, watches, giving her money, coke, offering to buy her cars?  It was crazy!  She ran out of hiding places! I was hiding a lot of that stuff over here! Well, Mom ran across a diamond lighter and asked a few questions, and that night Jeanette decided it was time to move out. So while mom and dad were at work she just wrote a note, grabbed the valuables, left all her clothes, shoes, everything, and boogied. She’ll do OK,” he said.  “Here, you stir for awhile.  Don’t let it stick.”“Why don’t I have luck like that?” I asked.“Because you aren’t a disco slut,” he said.  “Neither am I.  But I’m going to keep on plugging away ‘til I get it right.”That night I was awakened by a horrible bellowing, ululating noise. It sounded as if a flock of flying monkeys were perched in one of the nearby fir trees.  Screams, groans, keening, warbling, howling and yapping - and close!  Way too close!  What in the everlasting fuck!  There hadn’t been any flying monkeys in Milwaukie when I was a kid!I said screw it,  locked the shed behind me and ran like a motherfucker over to Mike’s house and knocked on the back door.“Isn’t it the worst?” Mike said, and came in with two plates of apple pie. He set them on the coffee table next to the bourbon and we picked up our forks.“What the fuck is that?” I said, just terrified.“Oh, you mean Bigfoot?” Mike said.  “Yeah, that’s Bigfoot.  Calling his mate.”“I wish the bastard would use the phone,” I said.  “I sat up before I was all the way awake and hit my head on the metal thing that goes across.  Check and see,” I said, and Mike looked.“No blood.  You’re lucky.  Bigfoot is attracted by the smell of human blood.”“Well there you go.  I am taking no chances.”Whatever it was started up again. I sat there looking around in amazement and fear.  What if it was a person?  A crazy person who went around screaming at night?  There was a rest home a few blocks down.  Maybe someone had gotten loose and was out there, whooping and screeching out under the stars in his hospital johnny.“Is that a person?” I asked. “Seriously, that sounds like a person, Mike.  Quit fucking around with me.”“I told you,” Mike grinned, eating a bite of pie.The Beast With No Name cut loose again, and I was the only person in the room who gave a damn.  “Come on.  Tell me what it is!”“It’s Brendel.  The Fields’ dog.  Isn’t it horrible?” Mike laughed.  “You never know what’s going to set him off.  He’ll do that for hours.”“THAT’S A FUCKIN' DOG?” I exclaimed. “What the hell!  What the hell!  What kind of dog sounds like that? No dog sounds like that! Is it sick? Should we go look?”“Nope.  Go and see if you don’t believe it,” laughed Mike.  “He’s sitting right out back on the porch thing on Jim’s little shed there.  You can see it from my bedroom window.”I ran back and sure enough, I could see through the forsythia and money plant, over the wire fence and into the Fields back yard, which sat somewhat uphill from Mike’s cottage.  There on the corner of the small deck was an animal.  It did not move.  Its outline was sort of like a dog. About terrier sized. Stock still.And then both front paws came up off the decking and the small animal let loose a quavering yell, a howl occasionally marked by sudden drastic changes of note. After having performed that aria, the noise trailed off in yodels, and then the dog went silent, and once again sat still as stone.  I clambered off the bed and met the gaze of Mike, who was leaning in the doorway shaking his head.“As if they weren’t fucked up enough, right?” Mike sighed.  “Wait till you get a load of their cat.”___________________________________________Mike and I did a little partying in Portland when I went to his gigs.  But once I was back in Felony Flats, that day to day doing nothing shit was making me nuts, so I mustered up my front and I went from door to door down the street and asked if anyone needed help with anything.  You could still do that then. I loaded stuff into pickup trucks, mowed a lot of lawns, helped dig up a septic tank and did a lot of painting over the next few weeks.  If I could have made any kind of a living doing that I would have been perfectly satisfied.  I liked meeting the people in the neighborhood. I liked the labor, and doing something necessary. As it was I  collected a few bucks, and the names and numbers of people who would vouch for my ability to work like a medieval peasant.I managed to steer clear of all things Fields, too. This was not easy, and made for a lot of ducking and diving, which was ridiculous.  I learned what their cars looked like and who was on what schedule.  That was a good part of the battle won, but as I learned for myself one night, with only a thin sheet of metal between us, Melvin did in fact lurk around the neighborhood under cover of darkness and spank his monkey. And then one day Mike told me that Mr. and Mrs. Fields had invited me to dinner, which I wanted to do like I wanted a peck in the head with a sharp rock.  I had no idea what was up with that, so I  just took that information and tossed it.  Fuck'em.I did actually go to a few job interviews.  Of course, nobody in Milwaukie was hiring, which didn’t surprise me, so I was hitting the Portland market, riding the bus to and from.I would get out of this town again.  I would.______________________________________Mikes parents had the whole suburban dream going - an outdoor Tiki bar, a covered lawn swing and four swivel chairs around a table on their back deck, all roofed with corrugated fiberglass; and an above-ground pool further back in the yard that hid my little tin hideaway from view.  Once Mom and Dad Scherholtz went to work, Mike and I would hop in the pool for awhile, and then kick back with a drink, passing a joint.  “What's the deal with your parents being OK about Jeanette...oh lets face it, she’s in business. Why is that OK?  She’s seventeen for fucks sake, but I’m the sleaze?”“Mom was noooooo different,” Mike said, tapping his cheek to make smoke rings.  “She married dad when she was sixteen and I came along seven months later,” he grinned.  “Of course back then it was different. My aunt told me. See, back then it was all about property, not romance.  Milwaukie was still a little rural town then and it was still old-timey here. If you didn’t come from a well-off family, you were sort of encouraged to go around to all the guys who stood to inherit big and marry the one who knocked you up.  Everyone just looked the other way.”  He nodded.“Oh.  But now Big Mama’s like butter wouldn’t melt,” I observed.  “Notice how that happens? People have kids and suddenly everything was perfect back in the good old days?  Damn that bullshit pisses me off! People need to tell their kids what real life is going to be like.  You know,” I took a drag and held it “the first time that Dan hit me I was, I dunno, shocked out of being able to know better, so I called my mom and told her what happened.  She laughed and said ‘Oh, that comes with the territory.’ \"“The more I hear about these people the more I want to paint a swastika on the side of their house or something,” Mike said. “Gawd. My parents were not that way.  I mean yeah, they're all about keep up with the Joneses, but they’re not assholes. Shit. I hate to think of what would happen if anyone tried something on Jeanette.  We’d be hustling her across the Mexican Border,” he laughed.We both heard the crashing at the same time. Quickly we drained our glasses and hid them under the table as Jim and a weary looking Melvin came around the side of the house.“We knocked on the front door for a half an hour until we decided to check the back yard.  Your parents really need to get out and trim all that brush back,” Jim said.“I just got off work,” Melvin announced.  “Eight hours. Whew.”Jim stood looking down at me.  “Well. Royce, my idiotic parents have been trying to get you to come over and have dinner with us, and frankly I just got tired of the subject and came over here to deliver the message in person.  If mom’s too damn lazy to get off her fat old butt and waddle over and knock on the door, well fine.”  Jim pushed his glasses up and crossed his arms.I had been served notice.  Was I was gonna ignore that shit?  Yes I was.“Boy, I just got off work about forty-five minutes ago,” Melvin reminded us. “I want a sandwich.  I’m gonna go make myself a, you know, a-”Mike sighed.  “You know how my mother feels about that.”“Well, well, then, just don’t tell the bitch!” Melvin said.  “She doesn’t have to know!  All I want, you know, is a darn peanut butter sandwich!  That’s nothing!  You wont, you won’t starve to death if I have a darn peanut sandwich!”“I’d like one too,” Jim said.  “I’ll go look.”“No. Guys, we’ve been through this,” Mike said. “You don’t get to barge in and help yourselves, and Mom and Dad aren’t home.  By the way you owe me a bottle of Worcestershire sauce,” he said pointedly, looking at Jim.“Well I am sorry!” Jim said in a lordly manner.  “ I didn’t think you’d get upset over Worcestershire sauce.”“You drank the Worcestershire sauce.  I’m letting the mustard fly,” Mike said.Mikes' dog Barney clambered out of the pool and went galumphing around happily, just for the sheer sake of galumphing.  He was a great Dane, and you knew it the instant you knocked on the front door. He had a huge, deep-chested WOOF that made the panes of the windows rattle.  But if you were there with one of the family he was fine with that, a happy doofus snoofling at bees on dandelions, jumping up on trees to see the squirrels chattering at him, rolling around on his back.“Boy, I’d like to have a dick like that, huh?” Melvin said, gazing in avid admiration at Barneys’ family jewels waggling about.  “I mean look at that thing!  That dog has a bigger dick than, than people!”“And you had a cardiac infarction when Mike dropped his towel?” Jim said.“Well I sure don’t, I don’t want what he’s got!” Melvin said, getting red and hectic. “That’d be faggy! I’m not a faggot! I'm not faggy!  I have a girlfriend!”“That you see once every two months.  When her parents let you,” Jim pointed out loftily.  “That’s not exactly a girlfriend if you ask me.  That’s more of an acquaintance.”“Nuh uh!  We fuck,” Melvin retorted, and I put my forehead in my hand.  Mike was laughing hysterically, which did not help.  “That’s enough,” I said, and headed straight into the house.Now I was not allowed to be in the house, but I was in no way obliged to tolerate Creeple dee and Creeple dumb demanding sandwiches and talking about dog wieners either.  I compromised by locking the door and sitting against it in case they tried to break it down in a peanut butter - starved frenzy.A half an hour later they were still out there, and I said fuck this.  I was going to walk right out the front door and go...somewhere.  Let all the neighbors see Slutzillah.  Let the rumors fly.  Let the phone lines burn with scandal.Then I saw the big tilt-out cabinet next to their fireplace.Well whaddya know.I pulled it open and it gave me a little bit of a fight, and then popped.  Nothing inside the big triangular space but a paper bag at the bottom.  I looked in the paper bag and saw a bundle of twenties and a tennis bracelet, and I put back the paper bag and closed the door and stepped away.Now I thought really hard about this one.  Technically it would have been stealing, but it was stealing from Jeannette, who’d already moved out officially, which made it abandoned goods.  And the dumb twat had put her stash into a tilting cabinet so that when it was closed on the inside of the house, it was wide open in the garage, waiting to be filled with firewood.Screw it.  I knew it was there. So in order to preserve the Sherholz Family reputation, I let myself out  into the garage via the tilt-out, and left the money where it was.  I snuck out the side door of the garage and out into the brush, unseen, a shadow, the night, then cut up the hillside.But I put a piece of firewood on top of the bag, juuuust because.So I was musing the way you do when your life has gone to shit and you’re sitting in a church playground watching all the happy little kids eat dirt and stepping in dog crap and stuff.I had no place to live and I’d just wasted two years on an addict.Less than a mile from where I was sitting,  my parents laid in wait, slavering for the opportunity to crow over my misery, shove my face in my faults and and throw me into a pongee pit filled with shame;  and the people next door were mutant toilet monkeys.  I had no idea what my future would be.I felt pretty good, truth be told.I had a library card, I had a bus pass,  I had a whole new wardrobe, thanks to Jeannette - although I needed to get some bras; Jeannette sat on her assets.  I had savings, I had two months worth of unemployment checks left, I was old enough to buy hard liquor, and it was the end of August in Oregon during a time when the entire state economy rested on the sale of marijuana.Yup, I felt pretty damn good. Time to party!It was a fine evening, just beginning to shade yellow, the light coming sideways and making long shadows. The garage smelled good, dirt floor and gasoline, and the swallows flew in and out in loops over our heads. I was sitting on an old milk crate holding a beer, talking to Pat and her friends, laughing, watching the cars go by.Pat was a woman I’d met through Mike, and I’d hung out with her a lot.  She was good people.She worked as a nurse at Dwyer Memorial Hospital.  Of course that didn’t pay nearly enough to make ends meet, and so she, like most of the other nurses, was accepting Food Stamps.  Her husband was currently out of the picture, but his parents were being good about paying support, cash in hand, and so Pat and her son were able to stay in their little house on Harrison Street and not worry about where their next meal was coming from.All of her husbands’ motorcycle stuff surrounded us, hanging from the rafters, leaning on the walls, up on chains and sitting on shelves.  He rode with the Gypsy Jokers when he wasn’t in stir.  He’d been running a chop shop, in fact.  Had he been riding solo, no patch, Pat could have made a good chunk of cash selling all that junk off, but as things stood those parts were spoken for by some bad boys.  The GJ were known for knife fights and lsd, which is never a good combination.One of the ol’ ladies was getting a tattoo, lying on a card table with her arm outstretched over the artists’ lap, the tattoo gun buzzing away.  Pat had her stereo speakers set up in the open windows of her house, and Pink Floyd were on the Dark Side Of The Moon.  Mike was inside talking intently with someone about something.  Pats' son Nick was ambling around drinking sneaky sips out of everyone's beer.“So you gonna go next?” asked the tattooist. Carling, his name was.“I can’t decide if I want a tattoo or not,” I said.“You aren’t drunk enough is why,” said Pat.  “So wow, Dan, huh?  I used to buy so much weed from him.”“Everybody did,” I replied. “That’s how I met him, shit.”“His loss was felt,” laughed Carling.“You know, his dad’s the one who got him into it. Yeah. When his dad was interning up at Damasch he ripped off the hardcore pharmaceuticals and passed those around too.”This was news to me.  I’d never asked Dan about his business, because I couldn’t tell the police what I didn’t know.“You knew his dad?” I asked.“Oh yeah!  When he was a last year medical student.  Yeah, I used to run into him all the time up at OHSU, man.  He was passing around a lot of pharms even then.  God, everybody up there was doing them. The doctors and the interns and nurses and everybody. It was so easy.  You’d just note that such and so patient had a prescription signed for by whoever doctor.  Dan’s dad could fake all the doctors’ names, whadya call, forge them? So he did.  Wrote out scrip, hit the dispensary, and walked away with whatever he wanted.  It was a trip.”“God, if I’d known,” I said thoughtfully.“Well shit, love is blind, right?  At least you had one good year. Hang on.”  She went inside to take a bong hit.  That seems absurd now, but it was how you did then.“Hey, did you want to see my beer can collection?” Pats' son Nick asked me.I looked down at him, utterly at a loss. He was six years old for fucks’ sake. Beer can collection?“You should see it. Come on, I’ve got a ton of them.  Come on.” He took me by the hand and pulled.What the hell. I paused to take a look in passing at Carling’s work, and I was even less convinced that I wanted to get a tattoo than I had been previously.  Nick opened the door to his room proudly. Everywhere you looked, there were beer cans. The entire room was lined in beer cans. Floor to ceiling and...  “This is...a lot,” I said wonderingly.“Go in,” he urged me.He had beer cans glued to the headboard and foot board of his bed, like trees on a mountain range.  He had beer cans glued to his ceiling.  “Where do you keep your clothes?” I asked.“In the chestadraws, duh.  I got over three hundred beer cans and none of them are the same,” he said proudly. “Lookit up.  I put them on the ceiling with SuperGlue so the labels would show.  Isn’t it cool?”“Well, it sure is something,” I said.  “I didn’t even know there were this many types of beer.”“Mom’s friends always bring them, and sometimes I find them in the garbage.  Like up by Derringers a lot.\"“Honey, don’t tell me you’re digging through the trash for beer cans!”  I said, horrified.  “No!  Don’t do that!  Ever!  Do you know what kind of diseases are in there?  People put really gross things in those garbage cans.  You could get very, very sick, sweetheart.  Don’t ever, ever do that!”“Well how am I gonna get beer cans then?  I can’t jank them outta the Seven ‘leven anymore because they 86’d me,” he said.  I just looked at him for a moment.“Does your mom know?”“Yeah. She went up and yelled at them.”“Wow.  That’s...wow.  Well, this is pretty impressive…”“Hey, I got a list of ones I don’t got.  So if you like go out, could you get Henry's Private Reserve Light, Sapporo Silver, Labatts - ““I tell you what, I can remember Sapporo Silver.  I’ll bring you one of those, OK?”“Awesome!” he cried, and punched the air happily.  “Thank you thank you thank you!  I have a place that I left so the Sapporo can would fit!  You’re cool!”“Yeah, I was born that way,” I laughed. “C’mon lets get outta here.”  We walked down the hallway together, him dangling off my hand so I’d lift him up every giant step.  “I bet you’re the coolest kid in the neighborhood,” I said.“Yeah, I’m pretty cool,” he allowed.We came swinging and bounding into the front room, which was draped in leather clad men all guffawing and talking in loud voices. Pony-tailed women wandered through in bounce a dime tight Levi’s and crop tops that did their midsections no favors. I went into the kitchen and found Pat talking to Mike, and I passed Nathaniel off to his mom.“Did you see the museum of beer?” Pat asked.“She’s gonna get me a Sapporo Silver!” Nate said happily.“Well good for you!  Go out and talk to the guys.  I bet some of them brought you a surprise,” Pat said, and Nate went cheerfully out into the sea of testosterone and horsehide.“Guess who showed up,” said Mike.  “For thirty seconds.”  He and Pat laughed.  “Melvin! If you wander around I bet you can still smell his aftershave, too.”“God, it made my eyes burn!” Pat declared.  “He had on this leather coat, like almost a suit coat looking style, and he took one look around, stood there, and then voop, walked right back out. And the whole room went Shhh.  The smell just came rolling in with him like a big wave, man, like someone exploded an aftershave bomb.”“What I don’t get is what on Earth made him come into the house in the first place,” Mike said.  “There’s about twenty Harleys parked along the curb.”“Does he get fucked up after work?” I asked. “That would do it.”Pat and Mike burst into laughter.  “Oh man, there's no amount of drugs would be enough to make Melvin mix with guys like these. When the boys come out to play, Georgie Porgy runs away,” Mike laughed, which set Pat off anew, and she leaned over the sink and just whooped.  This news did not surprise me.“Hey, you got to get on out there and mingle, lady.  There’s a lot of USDA prime walking around the joint,” Mike said.“Oh no.  No no,” I replied, erasing that statement from the slate. “I’d head straight for the most messed up one and it would be love at first sight.”“Oh! You got my taste in men too, huh?” Pat laughed.  “Isn’t it weird?  Nate’s dad was so good lookin’, and like, I thought man, I am so lucky because this guy is way out of my league, and then shit changed, boy.”“He robbed the Far West Federal down in Milwaukie, down the hill from here?” Mike explained.  “Fucked up all to hell on about a weeks worth of acid. In a bathrobe.”“I’m still pissed off about that!  It was my bathrobe!  The police won’t give it back to me!” laughed Pat.  “At least I was able to get on Medicaid once he went away, so I got Food Stamps and free medical now.  Yeah, he’s up at Rocky Butte.  No lie.”“Wow.  Do you go visit him?” I asked.Before she could answer there was a clamor of voices outside, and everyone got up to go out and see what was happening.  All that leather creaking and limbering up at the same time made it sound like there was a sailing ship under full sheets leaving the house.There was Jim’s truck parked at the curb, and Jim standing in front of the hood, arms crossed, talking to someone who was just as immense as he was.  “No it is not for sale and no you may not look under the hood,” Jim declared in a lordly manner, his voice gaining an octave from annoyance.  “Go away.”“Come on, bro, just lift the hood,” said the huge man.Mike put his hand over his mouth.  “My God that’s Lonnie Baker,” he murmured. “That’s the fuckin’ prez. We’re going to see a murder.”Baker was flying colors, and since he was the prez that meant everyone was flying colors.  No cut-offs. The top rocker read ‘Gypsy Jokers’, the insignia was a skull in a jester’s cap, and the bottom rocker read ‘Nomad’.   I looked at Pat and whispered “How does a whole chapter run under ‘nomad’?”“They work with Lepetomane Shows. They're carnies, dude.”“Jesus Christ.  That’s a combination,” I marvelled.Outside everyone's attention was on Baker and Jim. “Man, be cool,” said Baker, and he set one hand down on the hood of the truck, way into Jim's personal space.  And there they stood, as everyone went absolutely quiet.  “Lemme look at the fuckin’ engine, man.”Jim was pallid and bristling with righteous indignation,  looking at the guy straight on.  “You take your hand off my truck right now,” he demanded in his library lady voice.  “Right. Now.”“Oh fuck this,” said Pat.  She went back inside, where all the pony-tailed ladies had replaced the men and were having a wonderful time, kind of taking up from where their boyfriends had left off.  You couldn’t have torn Mike and I away with a prybar.There stood Jim, hair in a braid, covered in sheetrock dust, with his rainbow suspenders and his gold rimmed octagon glasses, his jungle creepers and his outrage.  And I’ll be damned if Baker didn’t shake his head and say “Oh man, you’re too much,” and walk away disgustedly.“If you had asked nicely I would have been happy to oblige,” said Jim.“Oh my God you idiot shut up,” I whispered.“Never a dull moment,” Mike whispered back.Just like that, it was done.  People continued their conversations. Lit up smokes.  Went to go look at a motorcycle or to grab a beer.I slipped inside, and Mike came with me.  “Is he going to hang around now?” I asked.“Yup,” said Mike.  “And he’s going to say that he controlled Baker with his mind.”That was exactly what happened.Jim explained to Mike and I how he’d aligned his chakras and brought his energy up into his third eye and then projected his will and overcome Baker, who then had to do his bidding; and because Jim was perfectly focused, Baker had no chance to deny that intent, because his chi had been reversed by Jim's whatevermahippieshit.  It was a good thing that Jim had been training his ability to project intention by meditating and taking San Pedro, like Don Juan Castaneda.  His chi was balanced and unblocked. I had never heard someone say something so flaky with such utter sincerity. It was unsettling.After having filled us in, and telling us to avoid touching copper for the rest of the day because it would suck our vital energy, he went in to talk to Pat.“You’re coming to the movies with me,” Jim said to an indifferent Pat.  Nate ran through, pulled Jim’s handkerchief out of his back pocket and ran off laughing.  “You little animal,” Jim called after him indignantly.  “Pat, this is absolutely unacceptable.  Now get your purse. We’re going to the movies.”“No we aren’t,” Pat sighed.  She pushed past him to go to the refrigerator, opened it, took out a beer and closed it again.  Jim opened the door of the refrigerator and she pushed it back shut.  All this had such a practiced look to it that I felt bad for Pat.  She lived two blocks down from the remodel, and when she was home this kind of thing could happen literally at any time of the day or night, from what Mike told me.“I want a beer too,” Jim said.  “That was very rude.”“Just go,” Pat said.“I can’t leave you here with all these people!  They’re barbarians!” he said indignantly.“This is my house, dude.  I invited them,” she said tiredly.“Well you have terrible taste in friends.  These people are nothing but a bunch of bloody criminals,” Jim stated.Mike and I looked at one another.  ‘Bloody?’“Jim, go home,” Pat said. Nate ran back past and smacked Jim across the back of the head with a folded copy of The Enquirer, laughing gleefully as he zoomed down the hall.  Jim reached back and checked his braid.“That child deserves a spanking,”  Jim said sternly.  “Go get your purse.”“No, Jim,” Pat said wearily.“Oh God,” Mike sighed. “I have to go help her. You go out to the garage and have fun.”“You knight in shining armour you,” I said gratefully.“Don’t touch any copper,” he replied._____________________________________________There were nights that I cried so hard that I’d start gasping for air uncontrollably.  There was one night that I cried so hard I threw up.  I was beating myself up for something that hadn’t been my fault, but knowing that didn’t stop the tears or the horrible guilt and the feeling of loss.  I doled it out night by night, until I fell asleep.  The next day began and I got up bright and early, put on my clothes and walked up to the Derringers to buy a newspaper and a day old sub. I’d sit in the little cafe area and watch as Melvin came driving up to the intersection and stopped; and then waited until he was well gone down the road awhile before I went back to my pied’ a terre. I was getting almighty sick of living my life around those people.I’d spend an hour sitting there, combing the paper for jobs and cheap rentals. Then I’d hustle back down to the cottage and sit outside with the phone and make calls. Thank God Barney had come to accept me as a regular.  All I had to do to keep him happy was throw his ball into the underbrush, and he’d happily crash around in there, pretending he couldn’t find it, and have himself a wonderful time.One morning I was sitting there at the picnic table, marking off the calls I’d made, with Barney gooning around.  “Hey ya dumbshit,” I said fondly, and he came over and laid his huge cinderblock head on my shoulder as I petted him.  “Us unemployed people have to stick together, huh?  Yeah, you’re a good boy.  Yes you are.  You’re my best boyfriend, huh.”“Yoo Hoo!” sang a voice.  “Hello - oooh!”Barney was suddenly gone.I looked to the side to see a stout middle-aged woman smiling maniacally at me and waving. This, I realized, was the dreaded Mrs. Fields.  She was carrying something under her arm, and when I gathered myself for a closer look, that object turned out to be roadkill.Please God no.“Well I just thought I'd come on over for a sec and say howdy neighbor!\" she said, and with that she hiked up her dress and raised one doughy leg to try.I instantly shoved that memory into a dark, hidden place.“Hi,” I said.“Do you know that I’ve been trying to get you to come to dinner for the longest ol' time? Just to say welcome!” she twinkled.  “Now don't you turn me down, missy!  We’re face to face so you just can’t say no now, can you!  See you tonight!  Six o’clock!” she said, and then she turned away, petting the deceased...object...she was carrying. “There there there,” I could hear her singing to it. “Yes yes yes!”_________________________________“Mike, she bushwhacked me.  She tried to climb the wire fence, Mike.  She pulled her dress up and there she....wow, boy,  and she tried to come over the fence, and she was carrying a dead animal. A dead animal.  I’m fucked. I am fucked. I don’t want to go into their house!”“Well if you don’t it’ll just get worse, Royce. She'll follow you around and kick up all kinds of shit. Honey, I know.  But she’ll get all bent out of shape about it and you do not want that.  She’s not rational.  At all.  About anything.”“I truly understand that.  Really I do,” I replied.“OK. OK. Make it short and sweet.  I’ll wait about twenty minutes after you go in, and then come knock and say that you have a phone call.  Yeah, a call back from a job. Gosh, you say, I’m sorry, but  you have to go take this call!  OK, that’s good. That’s good. Now listen to me.  As soon as I knock, you stand up and start straight for that door.  Just say goodbye on the way and out you go.  Don’t stop.  They're grabby.”I’d been inside their house a couple of times years before and I had a good idea of how it was laid out.  It stood out in my mind because they had a huge, live-edge coffee table in the front room, a cross section cut from a log of camphor wood, covered in pots of dying plants.  The entire place smelled like Tiger Balm, which smells like elderly people farts, which is something you remember.“Don’t eat anything that she’s had her fingers in,” Mike continued.  “Well that shouldn't be hard because everything they eat comes out of a can.  And don’t use the bathrooms, or if you have to, use the main one, not the one in the laundry room. That’s the Melvin bathroom and the Melvin doorknob. No. No no no.”I was on their step at the tick of six, and it was Mr. Fields who answered the door.“Oh hiiiiiiiiiiii,” he said with a creepy ‘Hey there hot momma’ tone, gritting his teeth at me through his overgrown moustache.  “Come on iiiiiin.”I glanced around. Nothing had changed. I could do this.  There was a free clinic nearby.The table was already laid, and after a little milling around not knowing what to say we all drifted thataway.“Don’t worry,” Jim whispered as he took a seat next to me. “I’ll keep them under my control.”Melvin jumped into the chair on my other side.  Mrs. Fields came in around the kitchen island with an immense bowl and set it down in the center of the table, all smiles.  “Hope you like tuna and green bean casserole!” she sang.“I do, thank you,” I lied.As I was telling that lie, Melvin, Jim and Mr. Fields dove for the bowl and started shoveling the stuff out, scraping it over the edge of the bowl and letting it slurp onto their plates.  Plates filled, they sat back and set to immediately, like desperate beavers.Mrs. Fields was still up, so I helped myself quickly.  “Oh!  Why, I would have done that for you!  You’re our guest!” she sang. Then she sat down,  took the giant bowl by the handles and set it onto her plate.  The whole, huge bowl. On her plate.  And began to eat out of it.“Hey! Now we won’t have any, seem of those, those good leftovers, why’dja have to go and do that for, slobber in there?” asked Mr. Fields,  at the same time he was answering the question ‘Where did Melvin's speech patterns originate?’“Oh, you just shut the fuck up, you,” chirped Mrs. Fields.To my credit I just kept on chewing.“Yes.  Why don’t you shut up, Dad,” said Jim, and nudged me as if to say “I got this.”  “You eat all day long on that truck as it is.  You aren’t fooling anybody with your pot gut.”“Well I’m not tryinta.”  He turned to me. “See, I’m a milkman, see.  I work, you know. I work for that Darigold. Darigold Products. Been working there for twenty two years, see.  Yep.  I’m the one that delivers the milk. All night.  Restaurants, bars, schools, office buildings, cafeterias…”  and on and on he went.  I nodded, looked interested, and kept chewing steadily.  As casseroles go, this one wasn’t the worst I’d ever had.  Doing good so far.“You should’ve changed out of your ol' sweaty ol' whites, Mr. Stinky,” said Mrs. Fields.  “You’re out of spares.”“Well, well how the hell didja let that happen?  You just don’t lift a finger!  You’re lazy, is what you are,” Melvin said.Melvin said?“Now you just take that back, mister,” said Mrs. Fields cheerfully.“Fuck off, ya bitch” Melvin mumbled venomously.  Kept on eating though.“You know, he used to have four sets of whites until two years ago,” said Mrs. Fields to me.  “Then he ruined the one and now he’s down to three.  Isn’t that terrible?”I didn’t know if it was terrible or not.  “What happened?” I asked.Mr. Fields had cleaned his plate, that quick.  He got up and took it around the counter to the kitchen sink and rinsed it off.  “I had ta get an operation,” he explained.“Oh, that was so awful,” laughed Mrs. Fields.  “It was just pure ol' dirtiness on your part, is why that happened.”“Aw, just, you just shut up,” he groused, and hitched into the living room, where he laid on the sofa.  One down.“No it wasn’t, mother,” Jim said loftily.  “The doctor said that it happens quite commonly.”“It was awful,” laughed Mrs. Fields. “Oh my, he put up the biggest fuss about it too. It was just stupid!  What a big ol’ fussy-fusser!”“Well, you get, you just get your ass operated on, right next to your a-hole like that, you’ll fuss about it I guess,” Melvin sulked.…..oh.  My.“He had a great big ol’ pimple on his behind,” said Mrs Fields.  “I popped it a couple of times and then I said no thank you, no siree bub!  And he wouldn’t stop fooling with it! He always had his hand down the back of his pants fooling with it, just playing with it and playing with it!  It just got huge.  Like a golf ball!”“It did,\" Jim said to me earnestly.  \"You could see it sticking up under his uniform slacks, and that's heavy cotton twill.  And of course at that point it was seeping, and so he always had a yellow stain on his whites.”“Yeah, but it went away, though, for a long time, didn't it?” Melvin asked“We thought it did, but it didn't! It just went from the outside of his hairy ol' hind end all the way through to his ol’ brownie butthole,” Mrs Fields explained to me merrily.  “It was something to do with a pore.”“An infected scent gland,” Jim said.“Anal fistula,” Mr. Fields called from the couch.How I continued to eat after that is a mystery.  I blame my upbringing. “You see, humans have scent glands in the tissue around the anus. It’s a leftover from prehistoric times when we would smell each other like dogs do to determine identity, health, condition, and things like that.  Nowadays they’re vestigial.  More of a nuisance than anything.  The skin healed over, but the pustule had never been properly drained and cleaned, so there was a pocket full of bacteria and dead matter. The bacteria kept feeding and dividing and excreting, as you’d expect.”“Oh, sure,” I said quietly.“It formed an actual channel, like a sausage casing, as the infection tunneled through the muscle tissue.  Finally it reached an anal gland, full of bacteria;  which given the location is perfectly natural, and it ate it’s way through the wall of the gland.  Just a minute opening, but enough to feed all that  bacteria a regular meal of fecal matter every time he strained on the pot,  and it simply continued to grow.”“Like blowin’ up a balloon,” said Mr. Fields.“And you never even knew it, didja Dad,” Melvin asked fondly.“Nope.  Never knew it.”“Well you certainly found out, didn’t you,” said Jim, acid dripping from his voice.“OOOO!  Did he ever!” Mrs. Fields laughed merrily.  She got up and carried the casserole bowl into the kitchen and stood there scraping it out with her finger and then licking it off, staring straight at me all the while.  I was right across the room from this exhibition, and it did nothing to alleviate my horror.“I went to jump up into my truck, see, that spring seat they have in those trucks, you know, with the open side,  I jumped up and the goddamn thing exploded! They tell me I hit that sprung seat, see, and shot straight up and hit my head on the windshield and knocked myself out,” said Mr. Fields.  “Guess I fell out of the truck screaming and, and broke my arm and got myself a concussion. Yeah.”Cue fond laughter all the way ‘round.“And now you got to tell her what Jimmy had to do, now,” said Mrs. Fields, gaily insinuating.  “I wouldn’t do it. Nope.  Nothin’ to do with it.”“That’s ‘cause, that’s ‘cause you don’t love him,” said Melvin heatedly.“Oh poo!” she replied, and waved him off.“Boy, he screamed,” Melvin grinned. “He sure screamed!”“You would too,” Mr. Fields replied. “ I tore myself a new asshole, ya idiot.”Jim explained.  “I actually had to take all our leather belts and hook them together. It went all the way under and around the  bed. He’d lie face down on his fat gut and I’d kneel on his legs and tighten the belt as tight as I could around his hips.  Then I had to pry his cheeks apart half the time because the idiot would fight me,” Jim continued, scraping his plate over and over again with the side of his fork.  \"I'd take out all the old packing, yards and yards of the stuff, and then I had to poke a tube of antiseptic cream into the cavity and fill it - and then re-pack it all with clean gauze.  It was revolting.\"Mr. Fields was chuckling. “Ya didn't get it in the right hole half the time either, so boy, I'd give it right on back to ya! Right in the kisser!\" Mr. Fields laughed.  \" I’d be lying there, see, and that old packing, that's out, and I can feel that infected stuff just trickling all down, this green and yellow stuff, and that would run out all over the sheets and make a big pool. Same thing would happen when I was squeezin’ out a turd.”“I would take a huge pot out of the kitchen and I’d fill it up to the brim with the old packing.  Imagine it. To the brim,”  Jim said. I looked over at Mrs. Fields holding the casserole bowl, scraping and licking. “And you simply would not believe the smell.  At first there were long strands of necrotized tissue coming out with the packing, all green and yellow, and gelatinized masses of -”Someone knocked on the door.“I’ve got it,” I said, and popped up.  “I’m expecting a call!”I strode through a sea of arms outstretched, trying to restrain me, and reached the door before I was even finished with the sentence.“Well what’s, what’s the big rush?  What’s that supposed to mean?”  asked Mr. Fields, starting off the couch.  Mrs Fields was hurrying toward me, followed by Melvin and Jim.Thank God it was Mike.  “Well hey there, sorry to disturb you guys!  Hi everyone!”Everyone froze in place.  “Huh,” said Mr. Fields.“Hello, Michael,” said the Mrs, and not cheerfully at all.“Did my call, did they call me? Did they call me back? The job?  I’m expecting a call, sorry,” I said.  “Thank you for the dinner.  Bye.  I gotta go and take this job call.  They called me back. Bye now!  Thank you!”“See you later!” Mike said.  “Wish her luck, you guys!”Mike caught up to me halfway to the corner store. “Hey, hey, hey, now what happened?” he said.“I am going to buy a bottle of tequila,” I said.He put his arm across my shoulders.  “Oh hey. Come on.  I’ll chip in if you let me help you drink it.”Around about one in the morning I was starting to feel normal again.  We’d come close to killing the fifth, and we didn’t use glasses.So there I was.  This was my life.  I was sitting on a cot in a metal garden shed drinking tequila out of the bottle at one in the morning, and I’d just heard a story about an anal fistula that I could not un-hear, ever.We both heard Melvin at the same time, rustling around the side of the shed.He tried the door.Then he crept away.Mike looked at me, and the white was showing all the way around his eyes, he was so shocked.  “Did that really just happen?” he breathed. “Oh my God, Royce.  We have to get you out of here.”“No shit, Mike,” I said wearily.___________________________________I was sitting at the picnic table the next day when I got an idea.  I had three years of good, solid job experience.   Not a one of my former supervisors would say a bad word about me. How do you sell something?  You get the word out. I was already phone-calling like a sonofabitch and bussing to interviews, even doing walk-ins.  Well?  Up the firepower.  I’d make a resume, copy it off, and send it to every establishment I felt like I wanted to work for.  Worst they could do is throw it in the trash.I was up at the corner store putting my letters into the mailbox out front when I remembered that I owed Nicholas a can of Sapporo Silver, so I picked that up, along with a half rack of Budweiser, and walked over to Pat’s house.Pat was happy to see me.  Nick was ecstatic when he saw his age-inappropriate gift.  I poured two glasses full of beer out of that one can, and left him to wash it out.“I think the can is the main attraction,” Pat said after one sip of the stuff.  “This tastes like baby pee.”“Yeah it does.  Good thing I brought the Bud.  Listen, Pat, I wanted to ask you a question.  Could you sublet a room to me?  Or can I camp out in the back yard or something?  I can pay rent.  As soon as I’ve got a job I’m outta here.”“I don’t know.  I’m in kind of a shaky situation lately.  The neighbors went bitching to the guy who owns this house because they say I have too many parties and there’s people coming and going at all hours.  I mean, yeah, it’s true, but it’s not like we’re loud or destroying things or anything. I think they're pissed about their parking spaces, really.”“Well, do you mind if I hang out here during the day?  I basically just need someplace with a telephone during the day.  I’ll leave and go back down to the Sherholz’s and sleep there.”“Well sure, I don’t mind that, if you don’t mind  babysitting,” she said.  “No, that’s fine.  Is it about the Fieldses?”“Mostly.  Them and Mikes’ mom the hate queen. I’m sick of being looked down on.  She can shove that up her ass.”“She’s such a bitch,” Pat agreed.  “She hates everyone Mike dates.  When I was going out with him she’d make me wait out on the front porch.”Oh my God thank you,” I said sincerely. “Man, you have no idea how big a favor you’re doing for me.  I feel like a moving target down there. I have never met such a fucked up bunch of people.”“You shoulda met their aunt.  The one who used to live down the way here, at the remodel?  She was something else.  She would talk in a French accent and she wasn’t even French.  All she ate was sugar out of the bag and raw hamburger.  I stood behind her many a time at Derringers and saw her buy that.  Yup.” “No way.”“Oh, way way. Back when she lived there, the place was all overgrown like a cave. She used to walk to the store and yell at cars, you know what I mean?  Have imaginary arguments with the air?”I put  my head down on the table. “Oh my God.  What planet are these people from?”“The planet where your mom plays the accordion at your birthday party and you’re sixteen,” she said.  “I think that’s why Melvin is the way he is.”“That would go a long way towards making a Melvin,” I agreed.“You kind of get used to Jim.  If you’re here you’ll have to put up with him like coming over all the time, but he’s harmless.  He’s actually really super smart.  He was just raised by wild animals,” she laughed.  “OK, yeah. Yeah!  You get to run interference if he stops by during the day, OK?  You do that, then that’s a deal.  You got a deal.”This situation worked really well.  Pat had a party house, I was meeting people, I was having fun, and half the time I’d sack out in her back yard.  No rent.  Nine dollars for the telephone bill.  The man next door to Pat came by one day saying he needed someone to cut his apple trees, and if there was one thing I’d learned to do as a kid it was mess with apple trees - my grandmother had a whole orchard. This guy was pretty good about it and he had the tools, and I was happy to clamber around in the trees doing something productive.I made fifty bucks doing that.  Fifty bucks was pretty good money for a couple of days’ worth of unskilled homeless labor then.  That went into the bank.  When you’re living on day old subs, vitamins and beer, you learn the true meaning of the phrase “Poverty sucks.”I was carrying the ladder back to his garage one evening when who should pull into the driveway like Mario Andretti but Melvin in the Melvinmobile, a seafoam green Rambler with a plaid interior.  I stopped and stood there, holding the ladder in front of me.  Try and sex me down through this, was my thinking.The instant he opened the door a smell hit me - something like Jovan Musk for Men and filthy socks.“Hey!  I saw you!” he announced.  “Uh, you need some help?”  He got out of the car slowly, grinning, and finally there stood the Jacket of Doom, wearing Melvin like a cheap suit.Every seam was stained with a dark irregular brown something. The rest was a nice roan color.  It hadn’t been cheap, at one time; not at all.  He took a couple of steps toward me and then opened the sides suddenly, like a flasher, and I winced.“So whaddya think of my this, huh?” he said, smiling.“Wow. That must have cost you an arm and a leg, I bet,” I said cheerfully from behind my ladder.He took a step closer, still holding the jacket open.  “Yeah, I saved up for this.  I call this my ‘Pussy-Gettin’ jacket.  Yeaaah.”  And he stood there, pallid, shapeless and rumpled, wearing what was once a magnificent leather sport jacket, just looking at me with a smile.  “Ya wanna know why?” he asked after a minute had gone by.“Huh,” I replied.“Ya ever read Penthouse?” he asked, and his smile got thin and sleazy.  “Huh?  There’s ads in the back.  For sex stuff.  I saw the one for Andron and ordered it.  You ever, well maybe not.  You ever, you know what that Andron is?”I did.Oh my God I did.And it was all I could do to keep a straight face as what he’d done dawned on me.  Oh Melvin.“Boy, that stuff is something.  It’s real!  I took and, I kind of dabbed that stuff on with a q-tip you know, on all the seams here, of this jacket.  I look good in this jacket too.  It’s an expensive, it’s a good jacket.  Everyone notices right off.  It’s got fermons, whaddyacallit, stuff from human sex-sweat mixed in with the, the other ingredients.  Yeaaaah.  Women,they, boy they just always turn around and look when I’m walking by in this,” he continued, and gave the sides a smart shake.  “They always ask “Wow, what is that?”“It’s really nice,” I said. “Do a spin for me. I want to see it.”He happily obliged me.  And it did fit him well.  Of course he’d ruined it for good, and it showed in irregular, oily, spreading patches.“Looking good!” I said. “Well, bye now!”  And I went into the garage and shut the door and locked it.  Then I leaned against it and laughed  as I listened to his car pull out of the driveway, kicking up gravel, and screech away._____________________________________Pat and I were watching hanging out on the couch, and Nick was out playing in the street or sticking tableware into light sockets or something.  When Jim knocked on the door she looked up in despair.  “Oh God that’s him,” she whispered.  “Please please please tell him that I’m asleep, OK?” Down the hall she went to her room and quietly shut and locked the door behind her.I answered the door.  “Well hello!  What are you doing here?” Jim said.  “I stopped by to see if Pat needs anything.”“Not that I know of.  She’s got a mild case of food poisoning or something so she’s in bed asleep now.  I guess she had a pretty rough night so I’m here with Nick.”Jim headed straight to the kitchen and I followed him. “Nope.  House rules,” I said in a cheerful teasing tone.  “I am the official guardian of the refrigerated foods.”“That’s fine. I’ll just check the cupboards,” he grinned.  As he was reaching I took the flyswatter off the hook and whapped him on the hand with it.“I’m the official guardian of all the food.  Sorry.  I shoulda told you. I take my job seriously.”“Well I suppose that’s admirable,” he said. “I want a sandwich.”“I’ll give you a beer and keep you company, how about that,” I said.  I grabbed a couple of warm beers out of the rack on the counter and gave one to him.  “Now out out out. You go on ahead of me. I don’t trust you.  I have a fly swatter and it’s loaded.”“Well!”  he said, and helped himself to a seat on the couch. “I certainly wish I were.  What are we watching?”“It was the news,” I said.  “I don’t know what this is here.  Tell the truth I don’t pay a lot of attention to television.”“Neither do I.  I’ll watch the news of course, but the rest is drivel.  I’d really rather read.”“I would too.”“I can’t stand people who won’t read.  It’s not that hard.  Once you have the basics down,  why, it’s like sitting back and watching your own private mental movie.”“Yeah! Have you read Dandelion Wine?  There’s a mental movie for you. I love that book.”“Oh certainly! Ray Bradbury.  I love his stuff.  Well now of course you know that, we talked about that, didn’t we.  You know, all those books went into the trash.  Every single one.  Dad waited ‘till I was at work and he threw every single one of them into the back of the truck.  He just backed it right up to the bedroom window.”I wondered how it would be to live his life then.  If he hadn’t grown up with those people, what would Jim be like? How would he have turned out?  I already knew how awful it was over there.  I mean, if that’s how they acted in front of guests, I hated to think what they were like on an everyday basis.  I couldn’t imagine being a child in that house.  Gawd, what a nightmare that must have been.“The guy I lived with pulled that on me.” I remembered how lost and horrified I'd felt.  “He loaded all my books up in boxes and threw them down the garbage chute in our building.”“What a cad!” said Jim, with some heat. “What an absolute cad.  You don’t do that to people’s books.  Books are valuable.  It’s like setting someones’ life on fire and watching it burn.”“That’s what it felt like,” I said.“Yes, it certainly was,” he said.  “It certainly was.”It struck me then that he and I were in the same boat. I’d been able to leave.  He hadn’t.________________________________When I was promoted to parlor maid, I was given a no-nonsense uniform - a grey button up dress with a lace collar and cuffs.  I wore my hair up in a bun, and my job was to travel the building all day, doing a little porter work, helping stock carts, and keeping the public areas clean and dusted. I gave directions.  I ran errands for the customers - getting a pack of cigarettes from the lobby or a newspaper, things like that.“We don’t usually get resumes for entry-level positions,” the HR said, “but I like what I see.  We can promote you faster than most because you’ve already got the experience under your belt. We’re hurting for front personnel.  I hope you work out. I think you will.”And I had.  I was pulling in anywhere from seventy five dollars to a hundred and fifty in tips per shift, and it was all mine. I didn’t jack my customers.  People who stay in hotels a lot know all the games that go on, and they showed their appreciation of my honesty in cash - not as much as I could have gotten if I’d been the kind of con artist that usually worked the front; and call me a patsy; but I was satisfied with what I got, plus minimum wage.I also had a room in a cool old house just across the river in Southeast, right off the Ross Island bridge, so it was a ten minute bus trip to and from work, depending on the shift.  I was finding out that I really enjoyed living by myself.  Whatever the clinging need was that had kept me with Dan had disappeared.I still went back to Milwaukie on my days off.  I’d spend the night at Pat’s, and I’d always have a new beer can from one of the many bars in the hotel to bring Nick, who had run out of space and was now covering the hallway ceiling.I always made time for Mike, who had stepped up and been generous when he must have known it would come back on him.  I'm sure Conrad Hilton didn't miss the bottles of bourbon that came back full on the bellmans' trays.  God bless the wealthy and stupid; Mike had a home bar that rivalled the Playboy Mansions, and I was happy to have played a part.“Hey, you stepped up for me,” he said.  We were sitting at Pat’s kitchen table after a long night.  “Mom and Dad were about ready to kick me out.  Of course I was coming home after hours every night smelling like amyl nitrate and Lagerfeld.”“Hey, not a problem.  I wanted to go out with you!  We had a blast together!” I replied.  I finished off my beer and put the can aside.  “We always went on the best dates.”He laughed. “Oh! I get it now, sure!  You went one way and I went another!  Gosh, thanks!”“No, do not start.  I do thank you truly; and we didn’t always ditch and dash, come on.  You and I went to a lot of places together. God, I loved the bars and the clubs and Hamburger Mary’s and Darcelles and all those places.  Just being downtown. Man,  I would have never had any kind of a life if you hadn’t decided that I made a plausible-looking girlfriend,” I grinned.“Have you run into what’s his fuck?”I looked out the window.  There was a pale light shining on the wet leaves of the apple trees in the next yard.  “He disappeared.  I did find out what he was doing though.  He’d been hanging out with this group of homeless people down in the Fountains, in that area there by the river?  They were all runaways and you know, mostly younger people.  And yeah, he was into pcp.  He got section elevened too. He might be on the secure ward in Southeast now.  I haven't checked.  I can believe it, but I can’t at the same time.”“You know the Fields still ask about you,” he grinned.  “You lucky girl.”“I’ll tell you what, I never intend to set to set foot in their house ever, ever, ever, ever again.”  I cracked another beer.  “But you know what?  They invited me in to dinner, which was sure in the fuck more than your mom ever did.  I mean there it is.  For whatever fucked up reason. I’m still working on the whole 'Mrs. Fields carrying around a dead animal' thing, but it being Mrs. Fields....”“Oh that.  Oh no no no.  That was Brendel!  She was taking him for a walk.”    Mike nodded.  “Hey see if there’s any more bourbon, wouldja?  Yeah, she carries him around the yard and then plops him down somewhere and he does whatever he does.”I was making him another bourbon rocks at the counter.  “You are wrong, Grasshopper. I saw that animal.  It was a dead animal.  I’m absolutely sure it was. Here, drink your drink, bossy.”“Fine.  I dare you to come down there with me and I’ll prove it.” He stretched out his arm and gave the table a smart tap with his pointer finger. \"Right now.\"Being drunk, it seemed like a perfectly good idea, by God.It was an hour of the day when nobody was home.  Mrs. Fields was off to work, Melvin and his father were still at work, and Jim had found a divorcee and was happily screwing the hell out of her somewhere in Oak Grove, which I thought was awesome.  Jim Fields, by God, was a kept man.  Good for him.We went in through the side yard, and Mike stopped and pointed.  “There he is.”“That is no way no real dog,” I whispered.  What I was looking at looked like one of those slag metal sculptures, the kind that people trying to be cool in the Sixties liked.“That mos' certainly is,” grinned Mike.  “That’s Brendel the Zombie Dog.  He looked like that the day they moved in, too.  An' that was back in 1966.  Thirteen years ago.”I crept closer.  It didn’t move. “Is it gonna leap out at me?” I asked, having thought of that a little late in the game.“He probably doesn’ even know you’re them,” Mike said.  “I’ll come wit’cha.”  Together we staggered over and took a good long look at the thing.“Mike, 'is ribs aren’t even moving,” I whispered, aghast.If you took a terrier, set it on fire, replaced it’s eyes with white marbles and gave it chicken claws, then ran over it with a truck and set it on fire again and sent it off to a taxidermist, what he’d give you back was Brendel.  “Good God Almighty,” I breathed. “This is, this was, this thing was what was making that noise that one night?  This?”“Shh shh.  Yeah.  Trippy huh.”“And the cat’s supposeda be worse?”“Depens on your taste.  I think it’s worse. It has some sort of disease tha' made all is hair fall out and it’s teeth fall out, so it’s orange and looks pissed off all the time.”Just then the subject of our conversation came strolling out from under the deck.“No,” I said. “Oh fuck no.”Years later I would see the work of Gunter Hagen on exhibition and think of that cat.“Oh fuck no,” I repeated.  “We need to leave. I’m leaving now.”  And I did.  Mike kept stumbling all the way back, he was laughing so hard.  I’d start laughing too, and then the picture of that cat would reappear and kill the impulse.This was the second time that I had come away from chez Fields speechless and needing tequila. I had to make do with bourbon and a couple hours of sleep.I caught the bus back into Portland at six, standing out in front of the old Rexall drug store the way I used to when I still lived in Milwaukie.  All the old displays were still in place in the windows, the Maja senorita, the Yardley deb, the selection of pipes, lighters, penknives and hair combs.  Nothing had changed.The bus pulled away from the curb. I found a Basil Wolverton religious tract in the window latch, and I smiled as I paged through it.  I loved the way his bizarre illustrations played against the serious message.Before I reached home, I folded it up and put it back in the latch where it belonged.______________________________________*”Foto Fillies” was a skin mag that had no text, just pictures.  Thought you’d like to know."},
{"title": "Danger Will Robinson! Danger!", "date": "Saturday, August 1, 2020", "text": "My next post is going to be a long one.  It's a true story, something that really happened to me, and I've given it a light treatment because you can either cry for the rest of your life regretting all those icky incidents in the past, or you can turn them out into the light of the present and hold them up for ridicule. Laughter changes them from negatives into ridiculous flights of nonsense, and they fly away with their stormclouds and shame and the nails that kept you fastened to those places in the past. I hope I get laughter.  I'll settle for 'ew, ick' though. I get a kick out of grossing out people with stuff that was my everyday life.  It cracks me up, so at least I'll be having fun, right?Anyway, I hope you read it, and I hope you like it. It has a happy ending, so there's that.  Gird your loins, faithful readers, and make ready for my next post.  Get Mistress Maddie to make you a sophisticated cocktail, or put on your bunny suit, light up a joint and settle in.We're going to re-visit the Meadows Family.I am gonna whine and rant! So get ready to gasp and clutch those pearls. Here goes.I honestly do NOT have the kind of casual everyday light and fluffy family memories that other people have.  Every time I meet a new person I have to weigh everything I say, and that doesn't make for a very enjoyable conversation, when one person never has anything to say other than \"Oh, that's nice\" or \"Wow, that must have been something.\" It also doesn't create deep and lasting friendships.The thing is, I've been through the Valley.  That valley is behind me now.  I no longer identify myself as That Issue and my life no longer revolves around Fighting That Issue. I don't even think about it most days. My life is mine now.  It's about my home, my family, my marriage, my town, making things, studying things, being curious and laughing and listening to good music.  I have joy now!  I am being shaped by joy and I embrace joy.  I'd like to meet someone who wants to be joyful with me. Like in a boat or something.  Movies. Sushi bar. You know, fun. I recently went to someones' house for dinner, and found out that knowing someone online for fifteen years does not mean that things will go peachy in meatspace.  The very least of my additions to the conversation shocked this person and their family, and it made me feel so rude, and so weird, and so embarrassing.  I didn't leap onto the table and say shitpisscuntfuckcocksuckermotherfuckertits, or anal fistula, or Hail Satan.  I just took part in the conversation, casually, with a laugh, didn't go into deep detail, answered questions.  I thought I was going into a situation where people had an idea of who I am.  Turns out I'm fine online; just not so much live and eating your barbecue.  And why in fuck was it me who came away feeling humiliated anyway?Seems to me that this person 'yeah, but' - ed who I am right out of the picture.  They've read fifteen years of me being me...yeah, but, I'm sure FirstNations is actually nice/able to be helped/ going to want to listen to my problems and want to deal with me being coy about wanting her to listen to my problems over and over and over again.If you think you've found a raunchy old hag who has 'Been There' and will really get you, who will dig and dig and dig and finally OVERCOME your opposition and MAKE you tell your awful truth so you can dump and pee and bleed and shit all over me, you are sadly mistaken.  I am not going to do that. I will not play that game.  And it is a game.  It's called 'Cry Rape'.It's when you don't want to take responsibility for your pain.  It's so you can say \"I didn't want to put that out there - I was just really confused and overcome.\"  It's when you don't want to offend people.  When the truth is dangerous.  It's you believing that you can't risk that dangerous knowledge being brought to light in a professional setting, but it's safe to dump it on some schmuck.I have never referred to my children, repeatedly, in front of company, as \"Spawn of Satan,\" or \"Devil-Spawn.\"  Much as I have wanted to.  That's not joking.  That's passive aggression.Recently I was challenged to post a whole week of 'nice' things.  No swearing.  Happy. Light. Uplifting.  And I did that.  Unfortunately, when I agreed to do that, I also essentially agreed that I am the exact opposite of those things.  I should have realized that the person who submitted the challenge was trying to 'make me better.'  I should have realized that I am still very susceptible to being cast as the villain of the piece, a source of bad things.Well, I realized it, and I utterly reject that characterization. I am ten armed Divines and ten Amazon bitches and one jackass and You Can't Stop Me.    If what I say and who I am and how I express myself scares you?  If it offends you?  If it makes you want to improve me? Looks like you have a problem. Looks like I've defined that problem for you, too.If there is a God, God gets me.You do not.Please get over yourself and get help."},
{"title": "The Lemon Cake Story", "date": "Tuesday, July 28, 2020", "text": "Fine fine fine.When my FIL, The Playboy Of The Western World passed on, instead of a eulogy, the Biker asked people to come up and share their favorite stories about the Playboy. The funeral parlor was SRO that day, folks.  Not just the family - and there was a lot of family; but also strangers, people who saw the death notice in the papers and came to pay their respects to a man they'd known when they were children and he was their DeMolay leader, their school chef, the man who raised Morgan horses on the family homestead and hosted Halloween parties for all the neighbor kids.  He was well loved, he was a four-times Past Master of the Masonic Lodge, and he never met a stranger.One after another people came up.  People began to smile, and then to laugh at some of the stories.  One man acted out a time when the Playboy had gone off in a rage because the only boat to the mainland from Sucia Island had been left untied and floated away, leaving the whole DeMolay group stranded overnight.  The laughter was becoming more unrestrained by this point.Then Mailman Mark, a dear, dear friend of the family, stood up and said \"I'd like to tell you a little story that The Playboy used to tell.  It was his favorite joke, and the way he told it was half the fun.  I think I can get away with it.  It's a little off color, but not terrible, you know.  What do you think?\"\"It's the story about the Lemon Cake,\" hollered a man from the front row, and just about everyone in the room applauded and laughed.\"It sure is!\" said Mailman Mark, smiling big.The funeral director looked in, and he seemed a little surprised.  People are laughing?  Huh? This is a funeral, you barbarians!And then Mailman Mark told...The Lemon Cake Story.(Now you have to imagine that the people in this joke are country yokels from way, way back in the old days.)A man comes walking down the road, an old dirt road way out in the country.  He's tired and he's hungry.Up ahead he sees a farmwife, a farm, and the wife is hanging laundry on the line.\"Well, she looks nice,\" he thinks.  \"I'll ask her.\"\"Excuse me, ma'am,\" he calls to her.  \"I've been walking a long time and I have to admit, I'm really hungry.  Thirsty too.  If you have any wood I could split for you, or a job to do, you see, I'm a carpenter and I will do that job for you in, you know, exchange for a meal.\"\"Why sure, that would be just fine,\" the farmwife says. \"You just come right in here.  You can do this and that, split firewood or whatever.\"And that man, he sets right to it and he really is working away there in the hot sun, splitting firewood, stacking it up nice and neat, and then he fixes the fence, and this and that, and finally hours have gone by and he just can't go on any longer.He sits on the step there and here comes the farm wife.  She's got a big, cold glass of milk, fresh from the icebox, and a plate, and on that plate is a great big slice of cake.  \"I hope you like lemon cake,\" she says.  \"I just made it this morning.\"Well that man sets to.  He's drinking that cold milk, and he takes a bite of that cake and it's just Heaven. Oh my goodness, he thinks.  This is great! The best cake he's ever eaten!  It's yellow and it's so pretty and perfect and it's just delicious.He eats and he eats and finally he's done, and he says \"Ma'am, I believe that's about the very best lemon cake I've ever had in my life.  I truly mean that.  That is the best lemon cake I've ever put in my mouth!\"\"Oh I'm so glad,\" she says, all pleased.  \"And there wasn't a thing wrong with it?\"\"No ma'am, that was the best lemon cake I ever ate in my whole life, that was.\"\"Oh good!\"  she says.  \"I did my best with that old flour there, and sure enough, it worked just fine, once I'd strained out all the rat shit.\"________That's how my FIL was sent on to that Big Gay Bathhouse In The Sky, folks.  It was awesome."},
{"title": "....and, speaking of the Human Bollard...", "date": "Sunday, July 26, 2020", "text": "My Biker has an Infamous Family Member named Dana.  She's a cousin.  She's a kindergarten teacher.  Yes, she has Kindergarten Teacher personality, too, and that's fine, once you get used to being spoken to s l o w l y  a n d   c l e a r l y with a great deal of inFLECTion EVery time you TALK to her!  She's married to a nice man, has a couple of kids, good life.And the woman is an absolute noodge.Yeah, she's a Human Bollard.  She's been one all her life, because my FIL had pictures of her as a child.  Just a cylinder rounded off on top.  She proved conclusively that she had no frontal lobes, just a hindbrain, and was an empty vessel filled with Satan when she was in her late teens, long before I came into the picture.  According to my FIL, the Playboy Of The Western World (my Bikers bio-dad, who was a bon vivant until his last breath) a  beloved family member had just passed away.  Who should show up bright and early the next morning at Beloved Family Members residence but Dana? Well...OK.  The grieving husband and adult kids let her in, and Dana pulls a post-it notebook out of her purse and proceeds to go around the house sticking post-its with 'DANA' written on them on all the objects she wanted.  And left.Blink. Blink.  Whaaa...?She never stopped being AB so LUTE ly a MAZED! that she did not receive all the objects that she had peed on.  She brought it up in every family conversation.  She just DID not UN der STAND it!  And on she'd go, and on and on, and the Biker family members would give each other longs looks that meant \"Here we go again, man.\"  And you could do it right in front of her; she didn't appear to care.  Even when that rare family member who would engage straight up on the subject would say \"You know, that wasn't really your place to do something like that, Dana\" she'd just continue to insist that, despite there being a will, and her being way down the list of people to whom the deceased was going to leave anything to, she should have been able to choose what she wanted and take it on out the door.She did this at other family events.  Did your big Corningware casserole go missing from the potluck dinner?  Dana had it.  Who mopped all the table centerpieces from the wedding reception?  Dana. Was a wrapped gift missing at the baby shower?  Call Dana.She'd give the stuff back without a scene, but was always AB so LUTE ly  a MAZED that she was asked for these objects back.  She was a member of the family too!  WHAT was  the PROB lem?  Well, if O ther people WAN ted those things MORE, they could HAVE them.____________A few years later.A Biker family member had died suddenly.  Yes, the man was 98, but he was a bull, this guy.  We'd just celebrated his birthday a few months before, and everyone was astounded at the shape this guy was in. Sharp, informed, strong, healthy, all that.  One morning, he simply didn't wake up.We were seated in the side chapel of the funeral home, the Close Family Mourners area, behind a beautiful gauze curtain, when The Playboy Of The Western World gives me a nudge and goes \"There she is.  I wonder which one of the displays she's going to leave with.\"Dana came walking in with her husband and children, and they sit up close to the casket, which was fine, it was appropriate.  Nobody is wearing a pickle costume.Myself, the Biker and The Playboy are seated at the far end of the same pew, and that's fine, it's appropriate, we're all clothed.  I even have a hankie.  That's the only part that mystifies me.  Where did I get the hankie? I don't own hankies.Everyone arrives, the music and lights go up a bit, and the pastor begins the eulogy.Dana begins to cry.Dana is really putting her whole natural self into this, too.\"AHUAAAAAAAAAA HA HA HA HUH HUH *snerrrrrk k k, snuffle, HOOOONK* WAAAAAAAAAAAAA HA HA HAAAAAAA, *gasp* A HA HA HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH *snerrrrk, snuffle snuffle sniff sniffffffff, pause, HONK, HONK*  WHA OOOOOOH, HO HO HO HO HOOOO\"   and people, I lose it.I lose my shit.  I have been fighting it back and it just comes out and I am laughing.  It is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard in real life.  Once the 'HO HO HO's started I was gone.Thank God for that hankie.  I was able to lean way over and cover my face with it, holding it in my hands, and hitch and rock with silent laughter.  I'd think I had it under control, and then she'd go \"UWAAAAAAAA\" like Lucille Ball and I'd lose it again!I felt my husband put his hand on my back and I lost it again!I was trying so hard not to make a sound I was getting stomach cramps.  This is a funeral!  This is serious!  I'm in the front row of the Close Family Mourners chapel!  But all I could do is hold that hankie over my face and go nuts while Dana, clearly the star of her own personal movie, is sobbing like a bad, bad actress, way over the top, utterly fake, at 'hog hollering' volume.When I laugh that hard tears run down my face.  I soaked the hankie.  I was creditably red nosed and smeared when I finally came up for air.  Of course, Dana cuts loose again.Down I go again, bam.I am grateful as hell that Dana is making such a commotion this time, because nobody can hear me going *snerrrrrrrrkkkkkkkk*, you know that noise you make back in your glottal region when you're suppressing laughter, the one that hurts?  Yeah.Somehow I make it through.  Danas' histrionics begin to pall.  I gather myself together and compose myself to play 'dewy sad Mrs. Biker' sitting in the Near Family Chapel, awww, she's so tenderhearted.  And I do this, because the deceased deserves respect and I need to get my shit together and act right. And I do this.  The funeral goes on, and finally we're all moving outside.My FIL finds me and gives me another nudge. \"Look,\" he says, big grin, and points.Dana is carrying a huge, huge floor arrangement of baby's breath, potted geraniums and fern sprays, the one that was in front of the altar, the size of a small foothill.  She is trying to stuff it into the back seat of her tiny family car.I leaned on that mans shoulder and just howled.\"Shush now.  Oh shush,\" he said, and then he started laughing.  Me and the Playboy have to run hide behind a nearby Irish Yew and laugh, and we're leaning on each other going \"Shhhh!  Come on!\" and it's just not happening, people.Then the Biker comes around the shrubbery and we get caught like naughty children.  Laughter ceases.We three go home in the same car.  But all the way home, whenever the Playboy and I would happen to catch each other's eyes, we'd start giggling all over again.Nearly home, The Biker says \"Oh, didja notice Dana sneak out with the big arrangement?\"Lit me off?  Off!  I am wheezing with laughter! Slapping the back of the seat and stomping my feet!  The Playboy is laughing and gasping for breath.  My husband just shakes his head and refuses to ask at that point.  And this is a thing he does.  He will not ask at you.  And he didn't ask at me whenever the subject came up for about a week afterward, and finally he forgot all about it.One day long afterward, the subject comes up finally, and he goes \"Did my dad tell you a dirty joke? The way the two of you were hiding back there laughing, I figured he'd told you the story about the lemon cake or something.\" (Different post.)\"Biker!  Your dad didn't tell me a dirty joke at a funeral,\" I said.  \"No no no.  We were laughing at Dana.\"  And then the whole story comes out.  Me cracking up all through the pastors' eulogy.  Dana making a horses ass of herself with her theatrics.  Her poor stolid husband just staring straight ahead the whole time.  The Playboy nudging me and egging me on.\"I thought you were really crying,\" the Biker said.  \"I even tried to comfort you.  Geeze.\"\"I'm sorry.  I'm glad I came off so genuine though.  But I swear to you I could not help it.  I feel like I need to go to confession or something.  I busted up all through your uncles' funeral.  I'm really sorry.\"\"I thought Dad told you the story about the lemon cake,\" he says.  \"When we went to my grandma's funeral, he told it to me.\"It's genetic.  That fucked-up sense of humor?  When you find your people, you know them.  It's magic."},
{"title": "Let Dracula Be Dracula FFS", "date": "Friday, July 24, 2020", "text": "OK.  Bram Stoker wrote a few books.  \"The Jewel Of Seven Stars\" was entertaining.  \"The Lair Of The White Worm\" was deplorable.  \"Dracula\" was his flash in the pan, his One Big Thing, and dammit, let dudeboy keep Dracula just the way his bad bat ass is.I am past sick and tired of people who cannot leave Dracula alone.  I blame Anne Rice for this.True, she wasn't claiming that her bloodsuckers had anything to do with Bram Stokers creation. But she cherry picked so much from the Big Bat that it's become inextricably associated, and that's just bullshit.  It's not to say that 'Interview With The Vampire' wasn't entertaining - it really was.  It's just that none of her other vampire books are.  All they do is hammer that difference between her leeches and Dracula into oblivion.Anne Rices' vampires are all exercises in edging.  That's it.  That's all they are.  Sooooo much rapture, so much tease, so much anticipation - but no climax.  Nope.  Am I the only person who's noticed this about her vampires? They're like junkies chasing the effect of that first perfect fix who just can't get there anymore.  They get right to the very tipping point, approaching true ecstasy, and then it all just fades, every single time.Dracula?  He GOES THERE.  He triumphs.  He vaunts. He prevails.  He enjoys being evil. Dracula  invites us to envy him because he knows he's awesome.  Lucy Westenra?  Bleed, bitch, and die!  Rise in glory and pillage, Lucy! Bite those children! Be the sexy beast you couldn't be in life!  Dracula creates MONSTERS.  Lestat creates whiners, drama queens and frustration addicts.If you're uncomfortable with Dracula being associated with Christianity in general and Catholicism in particular, then don't read Dracula and don't call your amended reboot reimagining mashup version Dracula.  Sorry.  If you're going to do Dracula you have to follow the rules.Dracula can:  fly, become a mist, turn invisible, climb walls like a gecko, turn into a large dog, a bat and a wolf,  use hypnotism, create blood slaves, create full-on fellow vampires with the same powers he has, beat your ass and nineteen other peoples' asses at the same time, slip through any barrier, teleport, control storms, fog and mist, and command rats, owls, bats, moths, foxes and wolves. Among other things.Dracula cannot: cast a shadow or a reflection, come onto hallowed ground, deal with garlic, wild roses, ash wood, silver or any trappings of the Catholic religion, deal with being denied, and you know what, go here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Dracula#Powers_and_weaknessesThose are the rules.  You have a lot to work with there. That Dracula can still create a lot of flamboyant havoc, and as long as you've got a devout Catholic around, you're all set.Now vampires in general?  Wide open category.  'They drink blood and.....' pretty much describes vampires.  I'll read your version and probably be entertained, because I like icky things.  I've had to learn to live with sparkly vampires, living close to Forks as I do. (For a Twilight fan this means 'all of Washington State.)  I can live with your plaid vampire, dog vampire, car vampire, go nuts.  Just don't call it Dracula.It's like Cthulhu.  Now Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean is often referred to as 'The Cthulhu Pirate\" because the dude has an octopus head.  Which is awesome, but is not Cthulhu. Cthulhu is \"a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind.\"  If you look at Davy Jones, you'll go 'whoah, that's freaky.'  If you look at Cthulhu, you'll go stark raving insane.  You don't go around looking at Cthulhu.  You look at a statue of Cthulhu.  Pretty much all Cthulhu does is be dead but sleeping (don't ask me, this is H.P. Lovecraft) and send out horrible dreams if you get too interested in him.  Ancient writings warn us that he will one day arise and bring about chaos.  He is taking a sabbatical at present. He/it did bad things in the past, and he'll/it'll do bad things in the future.  For now, worship him/it, don't look at him/it, and don't wake his/its ass up.Davy wears a pirate hat and has a ship and wears shoes and has conversations and oh, all kinds of things.  You can interact with Davy.  He sails around and acts like a dick.  His sheer ickiness, and that of his crew and ship, is incredibly impressive and cool as heck.  He brandishes a cutlass, and at one point in the past, was fully human. He even had a girlfriend.Cthulhu does not have a girlfriend.  Cthulhu spawned some...things, in the distant past.  We don't know if they just fell off him and went running around, or if he squitted them out or what, but they were evil.  He is all about chaos and insanity. Cthulhu is a member of the race of the Great Old Ones.  His job title is the High Priest of the Great Old Ones. And so we see: Any resemblance between Cthulhu and Davy Jones is superficial.  Using the same measure, then, Original Bram Stoker Dracula bears only a superficial resemblance to other vampires.  Dracula is a specific character with specific attributes, just like Davy Jones, Cthulhu, Bernadette Peters, and me. He does not faff around in Ikea or front a rock and roll band like Lestat de Lioncourt. He's not a complicated man (Shaft! John Shaft!) Dracula is a simple guy - dead, evil, drinks blood, likes things that way. He  has no second thoughts.  He does not regret being who he is and doing what he does. You either kill him, or run and hope someone else kills him, because he's a walking cancer, a virulent disease, implacable.  He is not going to be overcome by your sparkling psychological rhetoric.  He is going to bite you and drink your blood and really, really enjoy it.Anime creators?  Game creators?  Do your reading.  If you don't have the gumption to use a character that someone else has created correctly, then don't use it.  Readers?  If you're not willing to go back to source material because \"It's written all weeeeeeird, I don't understaaaaaand it, it's so old faaaaashioned\" then you need to push yourself harder and use a fuckin' dictionary already. SPOILER ALERT!    Dracula's actions brought to be a group of the most genuinely human heroes you'll find in fiction, and this is in 1897, when nobody in fiction came off real.  Johnathan Harker goes from being a hapless doofus into the definition of righteous vengeance.  It's an incredible character transformation.  Their resident sage, Dr. Van Helsing, is imperfect - his English is regrettable and he falters and makes wrong decisions.  Mina Harker is a throw pillow, until the worst happens.  She makes herself go forward by sheer act of will, every single step toward the foe, even after being 'raped' by the vampire, knowing that she's a liability at times, but entirely willing to go so far as to acknowledge, and then use the after-effects of that horrible event against their common adversary. They defy society, mores, rude inkeepers - and all to do the right thing.Now tell me Dracula has no relevance. Try him out for size and see if you can live up to the challenge.  Dracula fucking rocks."},

This goes particularly for an all female cast.  The Hot Baddie has the best clothes, lines and a loyal entourage.  The Plain Heroine is earnest and restrained in her fashion focus, has constant buddy conflicts, and one Saucy Mob Member with small tits and a smart mouth.Are we really hanging onto this, ladies?  Is this real?  Because in my experience, the Heroine is usually Any Woman.  Evil is usually miss 'rode hard and put up wet' Butt-Ignorant Hippo with cheap mascara and a flat ass (or a freakishly extreme shelf ass), or the 'rode hard and put up wet' ninety pound Butt-Ignorant Skank with a flat ass (or a freakishly extreme shelf ass), or the Human Bollard, a woman who is shaped like a lingam.  Look it up.  You're sitting in front of a computer.Arguably, The Human Bollard is the most evil of the three because she has no frontal lobes, just a hindbrain.  The Human Bollard is the one who blurts out \"All folks who don't believe in Jesus are going to hell. That means cavemen too,\" in the middle of Thanksgiving dinner for no reason. She does not shut the door when she uses the bathroom and does not flush, either.  She will tell your children that your whole family is going to hell because Daddy isn't a (place religion or political belief here) and asks everyone how much money they make.  She is an empty vessel filled with Satan.Pseudo-science gobbledegook is one thing.  Actual scientific principles can and will be checked.  Either make it up our of whole cloth and make up laws that hold the concept in place, or go by the book, people.  You want to cite actual science, you better follow through on every single detail or the nerds will pee on you.  I'm a nerd.Mumbling is not a plot device.  Yeah, I'm talking V E R Y   C L E A R L Y  to you, Johnny Dep. If you can't speak up, don't expect me to sit through that shit.  The only reason I put up with Cloverfield is that I was able to watch it years after it came out and pause it and go back over the mumbled dialogue with the sound up.  I don't regret the time spent because Cloverfield was cool, but it's not 'worth watching again' cool.If you think you're going to overcome a weak plot and weak dialogue with sets and effects, they better be pretty damn super-spectacular.  Metropolis got away with this like a motherfucker.  It still gets away with it. George Lucas got away with it twice - Star Wars, A New Hope, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  Alien I is basically an excuse to let H.R. Giger get loose (forever and always, I love you H.R. Giger.)  Pirates of the Carribean, Dead Mans' Chest gets away with it only because of Davy Jones, his ship and crew; the rest of the movie and the franchise can be flushed.  They all got away with this. There's the yardstick.  Use it.Shall we visit Parts Foreign?  Well then let's just film the Gritty Urban Poor.  Hell, let's just visit the poor, period, OK?  I know that when I visit another country, the only thing I want to do is hang around and watch people be poor.  Poor is relevant, man.  It's real.  Those suburbs and that huge city there? And all those supermarkets with roofs? Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!OO Egypt!  Let's grab Zahi Hawass and let his frenetic annoying ass hold forth at length, without subtitles!  No.  Let's not do that.  Tell ya whats lets do:  lets lock Zawi Hawass in a sarcophagus with a recording of his own voice as he berates everyone around him like a crackhead and make him listen to that shit for a few weeks.President Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, Diana Princess of Wales, Amelia Earhart, Jimmy Hoffa.  All dead.  Next.Oh, I got a bunch of them.  Tune in next time for my brilliant throwdown \"Let Dracula Be Dracula\" and until then, happy trails to you, and keep your stick on the ice!"},

Speed-delivery occurs.  Pork is glorified to ridiculous excess.Here's my problem:  Austin, Texas and the Pacific Northwest.Tony could not, and Andrew can not DEAL with Austin, or Portland, or Seattle.  Both men came up worshiping France and being awestruck by El Bulli. The French Laundry and Chez Pannise? Anaethema.  Too out front.  Too West Coast.  Too young. Smells trendy. Pass.Fuck'em.We've been out front and making change since I can remember, it's nothing new.  It's not 'hipster'.  It's not 'new wave' or 'Pacific Rim'.  It's what we do with what we have since 1960 and a lot longer ago than that.  After all, where was chow mein invented?  San Francisco, during the Gold Rush years.  Hangtown Fry?  Salmon in dulse? Tex-Mex?  The pioneers were eating that stuff, kids.  I have the old, old cookbooks, put out by Ladies Auxilliaries, Junior Leagues, Bible Study Groups and all the small town, rural organizations of women making do with what was at hand since the native Americans were living here side by side with the settlers, to prove my case. I have boxes of those cookbooks.  They are history. They are naive and crude and often egregiously non-P.C., but they are real as fuck and relevant fact.Amazing things continue to occur in Austin, in Portland and in Seattle.  Some stuff, yeah, it's ridiculous.  I am not a fan of the 'polymerized tamari on a long wire' school of eating.  To me, food is meant to feed hungry people.  But the chefs out there on the screaming edge are the ones who are taking the heat and making change happen, if only in defiance of their preciousness. Out here we have secret chefs, people who work for the extremely wealthy and reclusive in the San Juans, or the very poor and in need of a carb fix cheap along Guide Meridian Road, who are doing excellent things. Chicken finished under pastry with the tips of fir branches is astounding, and it was invented here.  Dulse and geoduck sushi; invented here.  Camas and celeraic, mashed - here. Air-dried oolichan smoked over alder was invented by stone age people and it's killer good, from right here, on the beach, looking out over the Pacific toward the East.  The California roll, well, that's from California, but give it a break.  The salmon taco, here.  The Sikh feast made with wild local garlic that comes up all over my garden (anything that the Guru Nanak Gursikh Temple wants from me, they get, and it's here about five miles down the road.)  The Chinese buffet that uses local ingredients and turns out stuff that you've never seen before because the Guatemalan and Montagnard chefs in back are substituting stuff that grandma used to save cost.  That's here too, and it's astounding.Learn to deal with it, people.  We're here.  We're weird.  Get used to it.  And have a salmon taco already, OK?"},

And a cult.Now I'll register the fact \"Oh, it's that ad again,\" and think of Madea, and trans shaming; then someone announces \"They call their selves the Rocka Douchies.\"Rrrrrreally?  You couldn't do any better than that?  Because this sounds like something that Madea, in character, came up with in one of her lovable wacky movies and submitted to a focus group full of people transitioning out of a mental health group home or something.  Sure!  Rocka Douchie!  Scares the hell outta me!  Sounds real culty!  My mother is an airplane!See, back in my misspent youth, I WAS a member of a cult.  I guarantee you it did not have no lameass name like Rocka Douchie.  It had a solid straight up 'we are legit as HELL' name AND logo.  A good logo.  That's what a pseudo-religion needs. A good logo.  The cult I belonged to had a cross for a logo! Doesn't get any more legit than that, right?  And the only thing in their doctrine that came the slightest bit close to biblical mention was to teach that Jesus was a child molester, because the cult leader had been in Galilee during one of his incarnations and seen that mess first hand.I really wish I was joking about that, but I am not.  I've given you (thousands and thousands of readers) enough clues to look it up for yourself online.  Even off line.  Go nuts looking that up.But you see, here's the thing.  Once I was in far enough that I heard that bullshit, I stepped out.

{"title": "Tongue Ass!  Paging Mr. Tongue Ass!", "date": "Monday, July 13, 2020", "text": "We have a chain of corner stores here called AM/PM.  They're interchangeable with Seven-Eleven, Plaid Pantry and a hundred other stop and go gas-marts.  But AM/PM  recently got themselves a new spokes-mascot whose name is apparently Tongue Ass. In the commercial, he is addressed as 'Tongue Ass.'  Every time I hear the commercial, I distinctly hear this...assemblage...declaring 'Tongue Ass!' at the end of the ad.  He is jiggly and grotesque and clearly the product of a diseased imagination. Imagine Bigfoot, if he were a fat, red haired, Scottish Rastafarian made out of snack food, with cheese doodles for beard hairs, hot dogs for fingers and a double cheeseburger for a nose.  It looks like the contents of a morbidly obese persons' intestines wearing a tie.Who thought this would  be a good idea?  I had to look this up.  I've heard this thing say \"Tongue Ass!\" about seven times today and I just gave up and gave in.Mr. Internet informs me that \"Tongue Ass\" is actually the wordification ( look at me doin' neologisms like a hot momma) of an acronym.  TMGS.  Too Much Good Stuff.  That's AM/PM's catchphrase these days. Some bright light in the Advertising Department decided, while ripped to the tits on LSD and bath salts, that if you took the first letter of each word in that motto and made it into a word, it would be pronounced \"Tumgus\" and it would be the name of a horrifying Frankenstein conglomeration of junk food seven feet tall and four feet wide that works in a quickie mart; and that people would really take to this sucrose-golem and think \"Yo I must now go to AM/PM only forever because this thing is a wacky hoot-a-roo!\"My local AM/PM is run by a she-dragon, a tiny terrifying hurricane of a woman single-mindedly determined to make money, who will literally throw you your change and say \"OK leave. Next, hurry up, next, next\" as you scrabble with your wallet.  I opt to use the cashpoint at the pump to avoid this broad.  Mr. Tongue Ass was made to be this woman's husband. Between her caffeinated avarice and his demented ickiness, they could go on to produce a quickie mart dynasty of mutant dragon-hotdog progeny who would jounce around happily and dump people upside down and shake the money out of their pockets.  They would be genetically incapable of cleaning a bathroom or applying a price tag and would leave a trail of powdered sugar wherever they went.What are we meant to do when confronted by Mr. Tongue Ass?  Are we supposed to love him?  Are we supposed to want to eat him?  Would you hand your debit card to a seven foot tall pile of junk food with hot dog fingers?  Would you ask it for a job application?  If I was still a stoner and this thing appeared on my T.V. suddenly I would scream and pee myself, like I did when Tom Peterson used to knock on the inside of the screen (Only Oregonians will get this) in the middle of Sinister Cinema.In other news, the Trump shrines continue to come down, one by one, all over the county!  There was even a \"Black Lives Matter\" demonstration in Lynden!  Incredible!  Lynden used to be the home of the third largest chapter of the KKK in Washington State, and now look....they've joined the 21st century at last!But the odd thing is that the hardest of the hardcore pro-Cheeto folks are bricking up hard.  Lawns have multiple huge signs.  Trucks and cars are being coated in stickers.  People aren't just wearing MAGA hats - they're wearing full Stars and Bars shirts and pants outfits.  I have seen this!  Someone call these folks' grandkids, please. It's just SAD.Just down the road from me is a staunch Orangapresident supporter who lovingly hand-built a cement reinforced Trump sign and installed uplights for it, so that the holy name gleams in the night.  I have been targeting this slice of outrage for months.  I went to far as to buy a product in a spray can, and keep it in my car in case I ran into the right set of circumstances. (Use your imagination.) And then I saw the dude out there one day picking the weeds around his little exercise of freedom of speech. The guy is about 103, and maybe a buck, if that.  A strong breeze could take him away. He has Essential Tremor.  He was standing out there next to the road with trucks blasting past weeding his sign.  And dammit, I lost the feeling.But listen up, Mr. Abortion Is Murder - I've still got that spray can in my car.  Your time WILL come."},

None of us knew one another.  They were there with their own small box, full of Ed's sister, and we all stood around the family plot and made small talk.  Then the Biker took a piece of plywood and an orange traffic cone off the small hole in the ground and we put the boxes in, stood around making more small talk, and then replaced the plywood and the orange traffic cone and went our separate ways.It was a lot like waiting at a bus stop. When I got home I opened up the house to let the breeze through.  It gets stuffy fast, with the damp weather we've had.  We have no screens, door or window; just never got around to it.  As I was sitting here trying to make my computer into a tool of FirstNations instead of a tool of the State, I kept noticing a flickering out of the corner of my eye.  Not too unusual.  The sun was peeking in and out, and the light glances off passing cars and makes a sparkle on the wall sometimes.  I let it go.  Until the bird flew into the window, inside the house, and I had to open the window to let it out.The flickering?  Swallows.  Swallows have been flying through my house, from the back kitchen door through and out the front room door, around and around like a game for the past five hours. What the heck.  Let them have fun.The swallows have been nesting on the same beam in my little metal shed out back for close to twenty years now.  I have to whack the side of the shed if I don't want to get a face full of startled bird when I go in.  But once mom bird is sitting on eggs, she'll just look at me placidly as I roam around, and when the hatchlings emerge, I'll have five little fat, bald birds watching me over the side of the nest, which is not more than six inches above my head.  Then one day they will simply be gone, done, flown away, and I will leave the nest there.   This years hatchlings fledged a few days ago, and have taken their first flights around the yard.  It's kind of nice to have them playing in the air through my house, to tell the truth.  I feel like a bird grandma.They say that swallows will always nest in the same place every year.  I wonder if I have the great great great great etc. grand-swallows of the original pair sitting in there, telling their kids not to worry about the hippie that shows up occasionally."},

They just could not understand what my problem was. My problem is that I do not have little stubby hobbit legs.  I can buy pants off the rack, and they fit.  Every single pair of pants the Biker wears has been sent to a tailor to take five inches off the length.  The Biker family:  built for comfort, not for speed."},

She owned these t - well just read this.  It won't take long._____________________From 'Brief History of Early Horticulture in Oregon'In the summer of 1847, Mr. Henderson Luelling/ of Iowa, brought across the plains several hundred yearling grafted sprouts — apple, pear, cherry, plum, prune, peach, grape, and berries — a full assortment of all the fruits grown in the then far West. These were placed in soil in two large boxes, made to fit into a wagon bed, and carefully watered and tended on the long and hazardous six-months' journey with an ox team, thousands of miles to the banks of the Willamette just north of the little townsite of Milwaukie, Clackamas County. Here a little patch in the dense fir forest was cleared away with great labor and expense, and the first Oregon orchard was set that autumn with portent more signifi- cant for the luxury and civilization of this country, than any laden ship that ever entered the mouth of the Co- lumbia. A fellow traveler, William Meek, had also brought a sack of apple seed and a few grafted trees ; a partnershiwas formed and the firm of Luelling & Meek started the first nursery in 1848. Roots from seedling apples planted at Oregon City and on French Prairie, and sprouts from the wild cherry of the vicinity, and wild plum roots brought in from Rogue River Valley, furnished the first stock. My grandmother grew those trees and plants in her garden!  I walked to the Seth Lewelling Grammar School every day, on the site of his old nursery!  All the properties around this 'little patch in the dense fir forest', which went on to be my neighborhood, had his apple trees, fruit trees, the concord grapes, everything!  My grandmother was related to William Meek! OMG I am absolutely trippin' here.  My uncle, a few blocks away, owned the very first commercially sold Bing Cherry tree, and it was still growing and still producing huge, deep red cherries 100 years later.  My grandparents knew Seth, William and Henderson, and Mr. Bing too.This absolutely blows my mind.  All my grandmothers' apple and plums, her concord grape, were first sets bought from that nursery!  I can go on Google Maps and see those trees still growing and producing fruit around my grandmothers' house!  I grew up under those trees, making cider from that fruit, and sneaking that applejack in the winter, spreading that grape jelly on my toast.  This might not sound like much, but to someone with a tenuous history like me, it's like proof that at least what I heard from my grandmother was true.  And it stayed true.  It's still true. The author proceeds to go on at length about his trials with the plum tree and selling fruit.  I don't know what he was doing wrong; the things form thickets where I lived in Milwaukie and are hardy as hell.  I had so goddamn many of those plums thrown at me as a kid that I still can't stand the smell of them. We had a huge old specimen on the corner of our property that all us kids merrily climbed, nailed stuff onto, swung from and peed next to.  It was enormous, about the size of a small house, and hung down to the ground all around like a dome, and the fruit was so thick on that thing that the hornets would take it over in August; you couldn't get near the tree. That plum tree was just a switch when my uncle planted it at the corner of his property and my grandfathers.  He had a little landing strip there, and the old stick and dope airplanes would park there and the pilots would pick those plums to eat as snacks. That outfit was long gone by the time I came along.  It was all suburbs. But occasionally a big piece of cast concrete would pop up as proof of the old strip and the little office with the plum tree next to it that had been there in the 1920's.This is so cool.  I'm outta here. Gotta read up about pioneer gardening."},

What is personality? What is the soul? Where does memory reside? Do memories dictate the future?  Are memories enough to base a past upon?' type questions to ask yourself while all the kung fu and bloodshed is going on. Two thumbs up, a twist and a kiss, with a triple lutz and a Flying Camel.__________________________________The shittiest offering is the series \"The Rain.\"  If you have a baby that cries all the time and won't shut up, stick that kid in front of this slow-moving woofer and watch it pass out from sheer baby boredom.  \"The Rain\" consists of white people slogging through the woods, with subtitles.  I thought there was going to be some post apocalypse action going on here, but instead I got a damp, tiresome reprise of the eighteen years I spent in Oregon. _____________________________________The very place where I used to live is now RAWK, or BBQ, or something.  CHAZ.  That's it.  The takeover down in Seattle on Capitol Hill.I lived four blocks down from East Precinct and a more useless bunch of ballsacks could not be found.  They did nothing. Nothing.  One night our building was under siege, actual siege, by a group of home invaders that was trying to break in and kick down doors.  This was in 1984. The manager sat behind the windowed front door on a chair, holding a metal baseball bat. We tenants took turns patrolling the roof so they wouldn't climb up the fire escapes, or onto a neighboring roof and jump over to ours.  I remember taking my turn with three other people, and I had an infant in that building, you realize, and all I had was a sharpened screwdriver hoping if someone tried the jump from roof to roof, I could icepick the fucker.  We kept calling the police, and they kept not arriving.  Oh, they'd drive past - they just didn't stop.I don't agree with defunding.  I absolutely agree with tearing it all down and starting over - from the ground up."},

I was out taking a walk around and suddenly the three little girls are all introducing themselves and talking all at once and picking flowers.  I got about one word in ten.Suddenly the middle girl, just a beautiful little thing, like a Caravaggio painting, starts telling me \"We had to move here because my mom and her boyfriend take drugs and they have guns and my dad had to move us out of there so we'd be safe...\" and goes on to tell me a real horror story, right out of 999. No child abuse happening, but I now know way more than I ever wanted to know about my new neighbors. Apropos of nothing. Having delivered that bit of information she goes back to chattering with her sisters and they pick a couple of flowers and wander off, and I'm left standing there going \"WOW.\"_____________________________________I was washing dishes yesterday when I had a realization about something that happened years ago. I was twenty or more miles up on the logging roads, way into the Mt. Baker Wilderness area, and had gone past a sheer rock wall on my way to find a waterfall I'd been told about.  The only prints on the road are mine, and the animals.  Nobody had been up this way in awhile.  And I'm merrily driving along, alone, in a Buick, and I find the waterfall and there that is.  I goggle at the waterfall, and that's nice.  Time to go back.A couple miles back down the same road I come to the same rock wall, and my way is blocked by a rock fall.  Not a colossal one, but big enough to present a problem.  There's rocks I can't move.  As I'm standing there planning my strategy I shout \"Shit!\" and listen to that go echoing up and down the valleys.And two dudes come walking up out of the brush. Big smiles. Two ratty, scrabbly, scroungy, guys in track shoes.We all look at one another.\"....Oh.  I guess ya need help, huh?\" says one guy, and I laugh, and the three of us shove the rocks off the side of the road and down the hillside.  I thank them, and we all wave at one another, and I drive off and never give it another thought. There is always someone out poaching, or hunting, or hiking or what have you.  For example, the lovely cloud-capped mountain in the back of this picture is called 'Dead Drug Dealer Mountain' by the locals,  because when two drug dealers go up, only one comes back down.Yes, this is the view from my front porch.  Yes, that's a damn good beer. It hit me, as I was standing there washing dishes, that I had been helped out by meth cookers.  Both of them packed; I clearly saw the pistols down the small of their backs, but this is bear country and that's not an uncommon sight. Had I been out hiking I would have had the same thing. No, the final clue was that both of them were wearing cheap track shoes instead of hikers, and both of them absolutely reeked of cat piss.  At the time I thought, well, guys out hunting aren't going to bathe, whatever.  But no.  They thought that they were going up to the road to meet their transporter, and what they met was a fat lady in a Buick.Holy shit.__________________________________"},
{"title": "Display Garden, Sumas, WA", "date": "Sunday, June 7, 2020", "text": "This devolves into a discussion of roses, just so you know.Our town has an 'Old West' theme.  And I live in a house that was built before Washington was a state, a poor mans' Carpenter Victorian, and so I felt that I would stay in keeping with my towns' theme and grow an old fashioned display garden.  All the front beds are symmetrically arranged and planted, tall on the sides, short toward the middle of the yard, framing the front of the house.  Because I've been building this garden for over twenty years, all the plants are mature and need dividing and pruning, and that's fine.  I'm at the age where I'd rather do maintenance than construction.  And I have left enough yard so I can zip around on my riding lawn mower with it's little wagon and look all pro. Do I have a single dandelion?  I most certainly do NOT.  And I live on four city lots. Yeah, I'm really that awesome.I did not set out to grow white flowers or mess with needled shrubs, because I grew up in the suburbs and everyone had that mess, along with  Red and Yellow Darwin tulips and some blue crocus in the spring around the apple tree in the front yard.  And there's nothing wrong with that, it's better than nothing, but my grandmother, who lived next door to us, had a Display Garden, and anything my grandmother did, I do.  I owe that woman everything that's good about me, and she grew a garden that was meant to be shared with people, that was an ornament to the neighborhood.Gardening is an addiction.  You put in a few German Iris, a couple of Arborvitae, some simple stuff, and at that point you can either say \"Yeah, that's good,\" or \"You know, I think a nice pillaring rose would look good by the side of the house....\" and you're done.  Welcome to addiction.It's why I now have a white rose, a plant the size of an igloo that gets covered in small white blossoms all summer long.  It's why I have an evergreen drift in the back yard, with a Yellow Hemlock and a Blue Juniper side by side, both conical, surrounded by miniature evergreen this and that shrubs. It's why I have a 'White Star' magnolia tree.Oh, I have ALL the colors.  Foliage, form and blossom, it's all here, every color of the rainbow, with blue a distinct favorite.  I have so much color that I needed the white to offset it. Without white, you glance and look away and your mind perceives 'orange.'  With white here and there, all the other colors buried in the green foliage are augmented with sparkle.  Think of the difference between a flat pool of water and one with wavelets. That twinkle turns it into something more than a blur.I most certainly did not mean to go into roses.  I wanted one in front of the house for sentimental reasons, and I found an old, old variety growing alongside an old church.  I asked the pastor if I could take a slip (something I don't always do) and he happily agreed.  That slip took like gangbusters.  I get hundreds of trusses of small, vermillion-pink blossoms, more blossom than leaf most summers.  I've taken so many starts off that plant -  and those starts take off like a house afire - that at least six people in town are now growing that very same rose, all from that one plant next to the old church in Nooksak, WA.I knew a woman in town who also grew a beautiful display garden.  We used to visit and talk.  She's since passed, but not before giving me a slip of her pillaring rose 'Sombreuil' which gets a pink and white striped, fully double blossom, and smells like HEAVEN.  You can literally smell this rose in bloom from across the street.  I have it planted next to the front door so that the aroma can permeate the house.I was lucky enough to find rosa 'Improved Josephs' Coat' in a little quirky nursery in Sequim.  'Josephs' Coat' was the Holy Grail rose back when I was a kid.  They're known for their extreme susceptibility to diseases and their outrageously thorny canes.  My version, exceedingly rare, is clean as a hounds' tooth and bulletproof.  It's in blossom now, and the display is ever changing, like weeks of sunsets, every day a different combination of reds, oranges, and yellows, an airbrushed effect, and simply astounding - a real show stopper.  People ask me 'Is that Tropicana?' because that's the rose you grow when your Josephs Coat craps out on you.  \"Nope,\" I say.  They go away and think \"She's sooooooo cool.\" and I am, but when it comes to roses, I just got lucky, and the downhill plunge into addiction commenced.I've had failures.  Oh God have I ever. \"Intrigue\" hated me at first sight.  I tore it out this Spring, no regrets.  Now if you live in a temperate climate, do PLEASE grow this rose; it's pure murex purple and it smells gorgeous, but it wants mild winters, good drainage, and it's a very heavy feeder.  If you have mild winters, a protected spot in full sun, acid soil and access to horse manure, this is the rose to grow. It's a specimen quality plant in the right circumstances.Similarly, rosa 'Don Juan' slapped me across the face and told me to fuck off and die.Rosa 'Black Baccara'? Slapped me, went joyriding in my car and took twenty dollars out of my purse before it croaked.  If you live  south of the Mason Dixon line, both these roses will joyously reach toward Heaven and sing halleluja.  You will get glorious, high-centered, spiralling, rich-scented roses perfect for cutting and competition  from 'Black Baccara' and it breaks my heart that it's just too tender for my biome.\"Lady Banks,\" a true vine, a twining rose, just cried itself to death.  I had it in a less than optimum place, though, so I'm playing with the idea of giving it another go.  Like I have room, which I don't.You see how it progresses?  You fall in love with a pretty face and you have to have it. You find a place, or make a place, any place, make rash and foolish decisions, and either become a slave to the beast or learn to live in harmony - or hold a funeral.'Night Owl', 'Fourth of July', 'All-American Red' (no scent), 'Cinco de Mayo' and 'Hot Chocolate' are highly recommended. \"All A-Twitter'(neon canteloupe orange) and 'Sunsplash' (stripes of highly saturated yellow, red and orange) are on the fabulous end of the rose spectrum and both smell like cotton candy! If I had limited space and wanted a rose that would give me gorgeous blooms all season long, beautiful perfume, a reliable bushy form and lots of thorns to capture and hold miscreants, 'Hot Chocolate' would be my rose.  It is hardy as hell, the leaves are a glossy green, and the blossom color is like a dying ember, sooty orange and incandescent. It smells great too. I would honestly plant this rose in front of a first story window and leave that window open all summer long, day and night, and never worry a minute, serious as a heart attack.  Nothing made of meat that wants to come through those canes is going to get through. It is scary thorny and very woody and tough. If  Mr. or Ms. Crackhead wants to try, they'll still be hanging there in the morning, and you can poke them with a broom and laugh until the police come by.I have rosa Damascena performing guard duty at my living room window for this very reason. Since I have a huge picture window there, I chose a rose with a very open, airy form so it lets the light and the view through. You get one flush of heavily scented red blossoms, but the leaves smell like apples all season long, and the canes are very flexible and have hooked thorns - think of Stalag 13.  I've shaped it into a fan and interlaced the canes, so it looks interesting all year long, and fantastic with a crackhead hanging from it.Two roses I recommend with reservations are rosa rugosa 'Frau Dagmar Hastrup' and 'Zephyrine Drouhin.'  Both of them are hardy, but they tend to come up all over the yard, and you only get one flush of blossoms.'Zephyrine' has no aroma, baby pink double blossoms, and is prone to sulk for a year or two after a hard cutting back.  It reaches for the stars, and wants to take over the world. These can get twenty feet tall, folks, with a tree to lean against.  If you want a tall, leafy green...thing, with very few thorns, this is the rose to go for. Hey, some people want that. It's so vigorously upright that I have it trained up an old folding latter for a support. My Zephyrine rose came from a mother plant that is 101 years old.  It was brought from Europe, around Cape Horn, and was planted alongside a farmhouse up in the mountains nearby.  I traded some tiger lily to a hippie for the start, and I'm pleased to have it, even though it's a brat.'Frau Dagmar' can be destructively invasive, rending apart cement walkways, patios, and foundations.  I have it planted far, far away from the house, in a spot where I wanted something that would form a thicket, and it did that job very well.  It repays you with ruffly leaves, a nice aroma and pretty red new growth.My very favorite rose of all time?  David Austins 'Munstead Wood.' Like Mary Poppins, it is practically perfect in every way. You get a four-five foot high shrub that gracefully arches over, and bears deep, red, rich, velvety, sooty, sensuous double-double blossoms that smell like rose-honey-rose. There is not a bitter note or an offputting tang. It has the most perfect true rose fragrance out there, besides 'Sombreuil.' The leaves are shiny and clean, the form is manageable, the blossoms don't droop, and it pumps out the flowers all summer long.The crappiest rose?  Crested Moss Pink.  It's just ugly. The plant is ugly, the canes are weak, the blossoms droop and are an unremarkable pale pink, you only get one flush of bloom, and the blossoms smell like baby powder.  The only thing it has going for it are the strange, ruffly, interesting flower buds, which are covered in funky sundew tendrils that smell like pine.  And that's cool, it really is.  The plant, spring fresh, covered in unopened buds, is .  Unfortunately, those buds open, the boring flowers face downward, and the whole plant just goes 'bleaaaaah'.  And you're stuck with this ugly, messy looking thing for eleven and a half months a year, unless you rip it out, per Vita Sackville-West. Life is just too short, you know?"},
{"title": "Memories Of A Wheel Ass", "date": "Friday, June 5, 2020", "text": "I am everlastingly grateful that I got into the biker lifestyle before it became stupid. Things were in transition. It was an amazing time to ride.  OCC and all those shitheads out there repping like they were the life? Bullshit. They weren't even close.  Jesse James was bullshit. Happy as hell to sell out.  You don't get a tattoo on the palm of your hand that says 'Pay Up Sucker' if you aren't all about the cash. I know from personal experience because I DO have a tattoo in the palm of each hand (certainly not 'Pay Up Sucker' please, I have class), and that shit feels like someone  grinding a lit cigar out on you for twenty solid minutes. Two hands, forty minutes of sheer hell.  Honey you gotta be convicted as a mad motherfucker.  Ol' Jesse only cares about Jesse.I grew up around bikers.  Lots of the dads in the blue collar neighborhood where I grew up rode, and some were clubbed up.  The main clubs going in our area were the Bandidos, The Gypsy Jokers, The Brothers Speed, the Tumbling Dice, and the Top Hats.  One of my dads' good friends was a Bandito, and another one was a Lone Wolf (no club) but rode with the Hells' Angels.I won't go into the wheres and whyfors and politics because that's always changing.  I will say that most - not all - of the clubs on the West Coast are Hells Angels Affiliates, meaning that they've come to an 'agreement' with the Eighty-One, and won't shoot one another on sight because they've all agreed that the HAMC are the big dogs in the neighborhood.Now I'm talking about 1%ers.  Not Susan and Dale going out for a ride on their Honda.  I mean outlaw motorcycle gangs, riding Harleys or Limeys (or Victories these days, since Sonny Barger switched to one.) I'm talking about back in the days when the old dudes were Greatest Generation guys, crewcut dudes, still living in the 1940's, super conservative, America Love it or Leave It fuckers.  They would not talk to a woman if her husband was nearby, and most would not talk to a woman at all, period. Motorcycle events were no place for a woman, and they'd make comments meant for you to overhear along those lines. Those old boys;  I never knew  single one whose wife wasn't a hardcore Fundamentalist Christian.  It sounds like a conflict in terms, but when a 50 year old woman thinks nothing of wearing a 'Property Of'  rocker, or having the same thing tattooed on her body,  then you've got a woman who is happy to hand the reins over to anything with a dick.The thing is, all those women started out being wild ass girls, straight out of Women In Chains, and that's who those old fucks met and fell in love with when they were still able to play horsie.  I saw the new generation of wild girls come into the clubs.  They'd start out righteous and fine, all out, full bore, straight up dirty mean and nasty, and within five years time end up being a \"yes, baby\" ol' lady, all fried hair and broad in the beam with a Marlboro hanging out of her mouth.Year ago my Biker rode with (but had not pledged to) a certain gang up in Alaska.  If you want to impress me, be an Alaskan biker.  Be someone who rides all winter long, in Alaska, with Spikes On Your Motherfuckin' Tires.  Then I will be impressed, and you can give me money.  He was not a member, but he was a 'bro'  back when that was totally a sub-sub-subculture term.  The other term was 'Lone Wolf', a biker who rides righteous - meaning they ride an American or Limey bike -  and hangs with 1%ers, but isn't pledging or a made member of a club. You know what, Mr. Internet is your friend here.  I'm using the terms, you get to look them up.Anyway, we met - and deal;  a tattoo artist introduced us!  Am I badass or what? And it was love at first haircut.  The Biker came down here from poor tired Alaska with his 1970's hair and I said \"Oh no that will not do\" and invited him over to my place to take care of his sad, sad hair situation because I know how to cut hair, and we get chatting, and I find out that he's smart and reads and has seen Eraserhead; and it is LUV .We ended up in the ass end of nowhere that is The Fourth Corner, WA. and set up housekeeping right smack in the middle of Bandido territory.My Biker buys a Magna, and it's a nice ride, a very smooth and mechanically reliable beast, but when he enters it in the local car/motorcycle show a certain Name in 1% circles (who was featured in an early edition of 'Easy Rider' magazine no less) makes a disparaging remark about its being a Rice Rocket. Quel horreur!The Magna was replaced with a Harley that quick. Now we're riding RIGHT.  Now we get respect. Now we can ride into any little town and that engine note is all it takes - all the kids wave at us and the adults look up from their crack pipe and Jack Daniels and give us a 'Sup.  Other bikers give us the biker wave as we pass in opposite lanes.  We are COOL. This just astonished me.  It was like riding around in a parade float!We meet our friends out there, taking road trips.  Foulmouthed smart agnostics who are born to be wild seem to be drawn to the same places, and we had some interesting encounters with people all over the map.  Old people were the best.  The ones who approached us saying 'Y'know, I used to ride a motorcycle...\" who rode back in the days of the Graveyard Pony and the Silent Grey Fellow, Hendersons, Ariels.  They would spin tales that left us aghast, or laughing, and every single blue-collar hero was on our side, male or female; working people with calluses on their hands.Tattoos were part of the biker scene.  Hand in hand.  If you rode right, you had ink.  It just was.  I'd wanted ink since my cousin Carol did her own while she was in Juvie, using a needle and a Bic pen cartridge.My first tattoo was on my shoulder, and commemorated a life event.  It reads \"Defeater of Demons\" in kangi, or perhaps \"Dumb American paid $75.00 for this.\"Either way, my cool meter pegged the needle. One tattoo!  I could walk down the street during a meet, wearing a tank top with my shoulder bare, smoking a Blackie, wearing leather chaps and boots, and the respect was awesome. Anyone who worked in a bar didn't play games - they just kept you supplied.  You tapped your empty twice on the bar and they silently came to fill your glass again. Waitresses played up to you. Managers, clerks, maids and bellmen were fast and efficient. You were what they wanted to be, and you were doing what they wanted to do.  What their fathers, sisters and brothers had done. Their mothers.  Grandmothers. Great-Grandfathers.Sitting in the chair waiting to get a tattoo wasn't something that has ever scared me.  And the tattoos I have didn't hurt, except where they extended into an area where there was sensitive skin with numerous nerve endings. Even then, just grit your teeth and sit still.  In a few hours it doesn't feel any worse than a sunburn.  Just don't ever get one on the palm of your hand.  Unless you're into pain.  Then go nuts.  I am not into pain.  Pain hurts. I found out the hard way.Despite all the tattoo shows on T.V., your tattoo artist does not want to hear the story behind why you wanted to get your tattoo, really.  The flesh is flying and s/he's trying to make a buck, and that means asses in the chair. He or she is wearing a plastic face shield and latex gloves, and they've had to craft their own needle clusters and keep everything sanitary, well-ventilated and organized.  You are the hazmat they deal with on a daily basis. So before you go in, take a shower, put on some clean clothes, eat a good meal, and be hydrated. Don't be high or drunk.Be respectful.  Do not piss off a tattoo artist.  He can take that gaff, turn it on, let it angle off a surface for half a second - which makes the incredibly sharp and thin ends of the needles bend - and hook you to death.  You want to be an asshole? Better make sure you want that tattoo, asshole, because you will never get rid of it, ever.  I've seen the results of this.  That ink gets rammed into the bleeding gutter of meat that those bent needles are making, and there it stays, and there it spreads.No.  No no no no no no no no. No no, no no no; no.  No no no. Most tattoo artists rode.  It wuz lak Peas an' Carrots.  At any given event in Washington State we would meet the people who'd laid on our ink, and there would be a Conclave of the Bod Mod Freaks in some bar willing to put up with a lot of flesh on display.Bikers took body modification out of the fetish closet into the mainstream.  I loved the shop talk and the amazing designs. The first scarification, keloiding, branding, implants, gauges, extreme piercings I ever saw were all on bikers, re'glar folk who worked in your auto shop, your bank, your grocery store.  And what was not to love?  Men in leather, women in leather, lots of skin, tattoos, motorcycles, weed and liquor, good loud music, burnouts, rapping throttles - Heaven or what?Most meets back then, if they were open and not by invitation only, were 1%er meets, hosted by the local club.  Since - like I said -  most clubs were affiliates of the Hells' Angels, (and most small towns here in the great PNW are well aware of the fact,) they could hold it in the actual town itself; close off streets and park the bikes along each side, knowing that no running gun battles would ensue, because there was always a Red and White rep on hand just to make sure.The businesses would all have 'Welcome Bikers' banners, and the owners of those businesses would make out like bandits. And oh my God, the motorcycles.  Amazing things. Works of art.  Speed demons.  And terrible, laughable, insane WTF things too, home built and somehow running down the road, by someone with more tools than taste.Riding a motorcycle is the combination of driving a sports car, and riding a horse.  You are IN the landscape, not just watching it go past.And just like a horse, a Harley stops every now and then and takes a shit.Well, the older ones did.  You were always working on those things in parking lots and on the side of the road. They were unreliable. They vibrated so badly your vision blurred and your whole body went numb, and they always, always leaked oil.  And that's new, straight out of the bag. And oh, God help you with that used Harley you just bought. My husband tore one apart and found that they'd used magazine pages stuck together and cut to shape for the gaskets.  The shit we found in bikes was unbelievable. Dried chunks of dead animal. Bad welds in crucial spots. Bondo covering up stress cracks, front forks bent upward like a letter 'C' (or the Rhino) from all the miles of straight -up riding, and you don't want me to go on, but I could.Now on the other side of that coin is the fact that the Biker and I had a nice little side gig going, customizing, painting and restoring old bikes and re-selling them, doing paint sets (Look it up, lil' buckaroo) and setting up a booth at all the motorcycle swap meets with all the old parts we'd stripped off.  One mans' apehanger handlebars are another mans abomination. We still have a shed filled with old stock.I was such a committed sales-biperson that pretty soon our friends were putting their stuff in with ours because I was bringing in the cash, kids.  I was the only woman actively selling that I ever saw, and I can sell ice to the indigenous Alaskan persons and do so all day long. I didn't just sit there sullenly smoking, saying \"My old man will be back around in awhile if yer interested.\" No.  I liked selling, because I got to people watch, and I met a lot of interesting folks and made good working connections. There is nothing like a big fat wad of cash between your tits at the end of the day to make you feel like 'Ick, I should put these in a bag or something.'Victory Motorcycles came along at the very end of that era, and thank God those were reliable, turn-key bikes that went like hell and wouldn't suddenly roll to a stop, or come up with a piece of the frame split or the engine making rock-crusher sounds.  Sonny Barger said as soon as they started making a reliable American motorcycle, he'd switch to that brand; and for awhile there they did, and it was Victory, and Sonny bought one and rode it.  I met him in Arizona.  He was OK.I've met, spoken with and talked to a lot of famous or notorious people from back in the old, old days, the Easyrider Magazine, Booze Fighters, take over a small town days. They were straight up working men, just...guys.  I only met a couple who were shitroosters.  I would target my shitrooster and walk straight up to him in front of his boys and bum a cigarette off the dude.  I always got that cigarette, because if the dude turned me down, I might go crying back to my ol' man, who might be President of the Psychotic Chainsaw Maniacs MC and there'd be trouble; he didn't know.  I was just some dumb bitch who didn't know how important he was, and he had to rep in front of his guys, and I'd walk off with a free smoke, having won my skirmish in the rigidly enforced white boy War Between the Sexes.OK. Now I'm really going to rank.  Watch out.Out of all the bigots, racists and butt-ignorant cocks 'o the walk out there in my world, clubbed-up, 1% bikers are by far at the very pinnacle of the shitheap. The vast, vast majority of them were rednecks. Rabid conservatives.  Disenfranchised,  edge of the herd types who willingly let their lives be run by the loudest and most violent person they could find, wore the same clothes, followed the same rules, had ranks, won medals, paid dues and fines, pretending that they were still in High School or the military, and were the badasses that they'd never been and would never be without that patch on their back.The soldiers - ordinary members with no rank - were sorry as hell.  Those guys were treated like nobody.  Imagine being a scrawny, 70 year old dude, never gone up in rank, still being called 'Critter' by your 'bros', working in a lumberyard or out in the woods, chain smoking, hard drinking, dumb as a box of rocks - and then you put on those colors and you're SOMEBODY. And your idea of being 'somebody' means that everyone assumes that you're a violent criminal, nobody trusts you, and you just might get hit by a car, just for kicks, out in America's heartland as you're working on your busted bike along the side of the road and the cops will not do shit about it. That still happened. And that was your life.Now  1% club women came in three varieties:  1. Ol' lady, unmarried. Dumb and sleazy, but cheerful and fun   2. Ol lady, skinny, rode hard, only talked to other 'ol ladies, sour old harridan;  and 3. Wives, the lite and fluffy Born Again Christian women in their mom jeans, wearing their 'Property of Ratprick' patch on the back of their vest, with a 'Jesus is Lord' patch over their heart, who followed behind their husbands and never said a word.  They all smoked Marlboros, and they all drank Budweiser. Well, Born Again lady would carry a Budweiser around all night, but you'd catch her dumping it out a bit here, a bit there.These are all stereotypes, and things don't become stereotypes because they never happen that way.  This is what I saw.Toward the end, coming up on the 1990s, you'd see a few women come riding in on a Wide Glide or something, and it was invariably her late husbands bike.  This is how she signaled 'Single, need a man,' and that big ol' motorcycle was the bait she was dangling, because after twenty five years of not working (Heaven forfend; a woman's place is in the home) hard, hard partying and not enough money for plastic surgery, your ass needs bait. And this worked.  You'd see the recently bereaved all sitting on a bench in the shade, while the men came by and ogled their bikes with the 'In Memory of Ballsack' sticker on the oil tank. She'd see one she liked and would go out and attempt to engage that man in conversation.  The Widows' Bench always had a line of cigarette butts in front of it an inch thick by the end of the day.I never drove a bike.  I was always a passenger.  I do not have the coordination it takes to steer, shift, accelerate, clutch, and brake or whatever order that goes in. The one and only time I ever drove a motorcycle, I whiskey-throttled my way straight out of the driveway, across the road and into the far wall of a deep drainage ditch.  The bike came to an abrupt halt; I did not.  Five airborne seconds of \"Gracious! I'm going to die now!\" followed. I ended up in the emergency room with my bra full of dirt and baby corn plants, my shoe full of blood, missing a chunk of meat out of my calf.Now we road trip in cars.  In a car, when a bee hits you, it does not hit you like a bullet and sting you - it just spatters on the windshield.  If it rains, you don't have to find a coffee shop or a motel and wait it out. If that logging truck up ahead drops a length of bark, you have the luxury of cussing the driver.  You don't have to ditch and dive.It's all right.  It really is.  And I've got excellent memories._____________________________*I grew up in what had been, 70 years before, The Howling Wilderness. The Wildest Part Of The Wild West.  Most people could not afford an automobile - but they could afford a motorcycle, or a motor for their bicycle.  The further out into the backwoods you went, the more people would wave you over, sit you down on the porch and show you their dauguerreotypes, great grandma as a young girl standing next to her Cyclone, or great grandpa with all his kids in a sidecar, next to the house, on his Hazelwood Colonial."},
{"title": "Old Neighbors, Threats, And Sucking Dick", "date": "Wednesday, June 3, 2020", "text": "More quaint vignettes from my charming rural idyll!___________________________________My very favorite neighbors ever moved three years ago, and I was bummed, kids.  I have never had a truly good nextie until she and her extended family moved in across the field from me.  No, what I had were  schizophrenics, years and years of them. I was always next door to the person who would stand on their back porch and scream incoherently at 2:A.M. and I am not telling you anything but the absolute truth.When Ser and her daugher Sar - and kids -  moved in, it was so great.  Ser had a baking business, and she made my husband's birthday cakes and they were astounding. Sar's kids made a fortune off me when Girl Scout Cookie time came around (give me ALL the Samoas.)  We were just regular, friendly, not 'in your shit' but 'there to have long outdoor chats with' neighbors, and not a single one of them was violently insane. Then they left.Who should I meet at the post office today but Ser and Sar and the whole crew?I broke Covid protocol.  We all did.  We hugged. We patted. We  exchanged droplets. We stood in the parking lot and talked shit loudly.  It was fantastic!  And Ser is moving back in to the neighborhood!  Look at the misanthrope getting misty!  but I am stoked, it's true!  Ser is good people and I'm looking forward to seeing her around again.__________________________________________The neighbors on the other side of me....oy vey.  I have stories.  But those stories came to an abrupt end when they all moved out, them and their 246,83539 pets and giant sacks of garbage and the daughter who used to stand on the back porch and argue loudly with the pear tree in their back yard, or just scream full-throated for 45 minutes. Yeah.They sold the property and good fuckin' riddance, because  they'd trashed it so bad that the fire department used it for training new volunteers.Actual picture of that happening. Rancho FirstNations is just out of frame to the right.There are firemen at the end of the rainbow.  Did you ever doubt it?    Now all that is gone, razed, hauled away, scraped bare. Up from the mud and weirdness sprang three fourplexes.  Once these units are filled I'll have an estimated 63 - SIXTY THREE - new neighbors (It was a four-lot parcel.)  The nearest unit is whammo, right on our lot line.   Things are quiet so far.  That will change, come August.  And by God, if I end up with the screaming nut in the unit right next door to my place I am going to go fully Old Lady on their asses. I am sick of that mess. If you must be crazy, do it SOMEWHERE ELSE. My empathy is all used up.  I've been crazy.  But I never stood out in my yard and shouted gibberish at 2:A.M.  Neither should you.I mean it.____________________________________________Last night I binged on a certain Infomaniac Bitches' blog, and I found a post that I wish they'd teach in Health Class.

Wow!  Look at that! Now what the hell do I do with it?Big ol' can opener? Check. Discipline collar? Check.  Large roll of foil?  Check. Clue? None whatsoever.  No quatloos for you.I've been married to the same man for 32 years.  I am a confirmed monogamist* and haven't had to worry about this shit in years, but that post brought it aaaaall back. That was an activity that I really enjoyed, but you had to be ready to do some vamping as you went over your strategies once that kielbasa was hot 'n' ready. And the Rhino was always bitching. \"Hey, I don't do 69 - Ooooooh.\" Or \"I wanna be able to see your fa - Ooooooooh.\" Or \"I don't wanna lie dow-Ooooooh.\"   And Mr. \"Too Much Of A Good Thing\" really, absolutely did not get that he was in a right-angled turn lined with teeth and not a straight, smooth stretch no matter how you gakked and herked - and no matter how much he kept repeating 'No teeeeth, be caaareful, oh you're ruining this!' with every. single. partner.My sluttin' around days were in the early 1970's when AIDS was just a distant rumor and all STD's could be cured with a shot of antibiotics and a hearty handshake.  Them that went around, went all around, and got notorious in the relatively small world of gay Portland in those days.  I wonder if D. or  W. ever figured it out, or if they're still out there someplace, grey haired, stuffed to the gills with Viagra, whining \"I wanna see your face\" and \"No teeeeth\" and wondering why nobody gets it already.______________________*Yes.

The tide had turned! Lady Luck was shining her light on us once again!Oh, and my garden?  HAS NEVER LOOKED BETTER. (see the title of this post.)_____________________________I am going to give you my personal, single experience of this quarantine. I realize that I am in the minority when I claim this, and I realize that it's simply a matter of luck and disposition, but I am enjoying it.  I don't socialize much, and when I do, I keep things casual and light.  I live in a small town, and that's how you survive, and fortunately I'm just fine with that, even without it's being necessary and enforced now. I've been doing social distancing like a boss, bitches, way before it was cool.People are not dying up on nearby Reese Hill Road - a notoriously steep, twisting, off-camber two-lane road that goes up into the mountains.  I'm on the main road through town, the one that most vacationers take to reach the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area, and it turns into Reese Hill about a mile down the road from here. I haven't heard a single siren, night or day, in two months.  That has never happened in all the time I've lived here.All the neighbors are outside in their yards, or strolling around town, riding bikes, skateboarding, and I've met more people this year than I ever knew lived nearby.  Most of the jobs nearby are rated 'essential' and so we haven't been hit very hard economically. The man who developed the lot next door is filling the units. People are behaving themselves in the nearby stores.  Most importantly, the Trump Shrines are coming down.In the reddest corner of the bluest state, The Trump Shrines Are Coming Down.___________________________Front porch shrines, little decorative arrangements off to one side, are A Thing here.  I never saw this (maybe around Halloween or Christmas if at all) in Oregon, not even when I went back to visit, but here in Washington nearly everyone has something.  Usually a straw bale with a few pots of flowers on top, and a decorative sign or a house star or a scarecrow, that kind of thing.I have a front porch vignette too.  It's an old, old bar room chair, a rifle* leaning in the corner nearby, and a sippin' jug.  My decorative sign does not say 'Welcome Friends' or 'Live, Laugh, Love'. It says \"Guns Don't Kill People - RELIGIONS DO.\"By the time I answer the door for the JW's, half my job has already been done for me.____________SHOUTOUT TO 63 MAGO:  I can't comment on your blog at all.  But I am reading it and thank you for mentioning me!*We took the wood stock off an old Daisy Air Rifle and replaced it with a length of electrical conduit painted primer black.  On the side of the stock that faces the wall, my Biker has written 'Don't Bother Stealing - It's Not Real.'  We've found it lying in the yard a couple of times."},
{"title": "What On Earth Happened to FirstNations?  Oh, I'll Tell Ya What Happened...", "date": "Thursday, May 28, 2020", "text": "Holy crapballs I found 63Mago and Mistress Maddie!  And one of them knows what my tits looks like!Well, I'll tell ya what happened, long-lost folks, just to catch up on things.I stopped blogging because my life exploded.Way back when, right before my life exploded, my daughter found the son I gave up for adoption when I was 19 (I was reckless) and it turned into Le Revue Merde.  I had put this episode of my life behind me, and out of the blue \"Oh mom I have a brother and he's looking for you!\" (-yes well, he was looking for something, but read on.)  And then...this same daughter, who at first was jubilant, suddenly becomes insanely jealous - and pregnant, and you know how nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition because it's chief elements are surprise, fear, ruthless efficiency and an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope? Yeah, nobody was expecting this either.   My son had been raised by abusive people.  What a great thing to find out.  I was absolutely shattered. And he turned out to be not such a great person either. He was cheating on his wife, while she was cheating on him, for starters. I imagine that he's still an alcoholic and still emotionally manipulative, and that his wife is still the stupidest human being I have ever met in my entire life, and that his children are absolutely feral, and that they are still a quarter of a million dollars in debt.Oh yes.I know, you're saying well, that's bad, but it isn't quite bad enough. OK. You win.His wife was a compulsive thief, too. Yes!  From me, from her business, from her customers, from her children's bank accounts, her parents bank accounts, and...basically, you should check your wallet and your bank account right now. Go.  I'll wait.  Nobody knows where the money went either; it sure wasn't used to pay bills.When I say she was stupid, I mean this girl was absolutely ass stupid.  Did not read.  Had no hobbies or interests whatsoever. Did not know who the governor of the state was.But how stupid exactly??She ran over a squirrel in the road to impress me. Yes. She thought that I would be impressed by her swerving out of her lane, into the oncoming lane, to squish a squirrel while I was a passenger in her car. Let me repeat that for the back row:  She thought I would be impressed with her for running over and killing a squirrel. While I was in the car with her. \"Wanna see something?\" she said, with a grin. And a swerve.So yes,  I cut things off with my son and his family, and his extended family; and I am here to tell you that there wasn't a sane one in the bunch.  It was drawn out and it was ugly.The above horseshit took a toll on my marriage. Oh boy did it ever.My son's adopted family and his in-laws are having drug overdoses and losing their jobs, and having lawsuits brought against them. His mother-in-law used to shit herself for joy - you cannot make this up - when she saw the 'Clearance Sale' sign in the Jo-Anne Fabric store window (yet refused to wear Grampers because it was 'just a little shit, not a lot.')Let's see, what else. There were two suicide attempts, a car smash up, and one strange chick who used to tell everyone every time she met them that she was pregnant* (Gawd I don't know, don't ask me) So yeah. My poor husband got thrown headfirst into something he never expected to have to deal with, and he absolutely did NOT deal with it - spectacularly.And in the middle of that, my daughter called the police on me!  She's bipolar, didja hear?  Yeah, that's how we all found out.  I parked in her driveway, and she hid in the house and called the state troopers on me...because...I was in her driveway.  (This causes a huge rift that has still not altogether healed.  We didn't speak for years.)Out of the blue, my son-in-laws' parents suddenly enter into my daughters life unannounced.  Surprise!  We're here to be intrusive! and started being all 'David Lynch' level weird.  Nobody knows what they wanted or why they were there, but there they were.  But the world was not done with my daughter yet. Next enter my alcoholic ex-mother-in-law with her own Brenda Agenda because hell, why not?  Then my ex-sister-in-law!  Everybody into the pool!  Come on! And nobody has a reason why!  They're just there!  I get tearful frantic phone calls from my daughter who cannot take it, and when I call her back I'm getting screamed at because I 'call her too often.' OK.And in this whole, ugly one year period of time, all these people are passing messages and emails of dubious reliability back and forth and it's now causing an actual black hole in space made of suck.  What was it about?  Just a whole lotta 'he said she said', mixed with a desperate need for psychiatric evaluation and MORE SUCK.Everyone is appealing to me for my take on their issues too! I was supposed to fix everybody's damn issues!  I was resented if I was not right there at everyone's beck and call.  I don't know why; nobody ever listened to me anyway.  Basically I was being used as toilet paper.  It wasn't as fun as you might think that would be, either.  So you know what I did?I said fuck all y'all.\"SHUT IT DOWN!\"   I went through four counselors before I finally got sent to a psychiatrist and he set me up with the right kind of medications - I take a bunch, but all at pediatric doses, so don't bother breaking into my house; it'd be real disappointing.My daughter decided that the answer to all her problems was to pack up in a huff and moved to North Carolina.  Once there she was still being crazier than a shithouse rat, and finally figured out that it wasn't my fault - she was crazy all on her little lonesome.  We talk, we've visited back and forth, but the relationship is different. I really appreciate the distance.Oh, it got real there for awhile.  My husband and I went through counselling and are back together.  That relationship is finally normalizing. We're doing well.I do not speak to my son or his family.  Something about being used as a free babysitting service without being asked - and jacked for cash to fund that shitshow just didn't appeal to me. I kept pretending not to get all the hints being thrown my way, and they kept pretending I wasn't pissing them off by not forking over a dime.*The lesson here is that it's not who has you - it's who raises you.  That young man, God love him, is the son of the vicious alcoholics who raised him. Not me. His multiple issues are with them. Not me.  Fare thee well, kid, and I hope it all works out.Oh yeah, I forgot! I was taking care of my father in law during all this too!My father-in-law lived all the way downtown but expected me to drop everything and come change his sheets and buy his groceries. Now, at the time, he was living in a luxury care center with a full, comprehensive, professional staff, like a king.  He wasn't doing this for the company. The man had more friends than Carter has little liver pills.  Yet nothing would do but that I be on call 24/7 and drive in all the way from nearly Canada and buy him groceries while downstairs was not just a dining room, but a dining room with a CIA-trained chef, all paid for, all part of the price. He was a well-to-do man and wasn't hurting for anything. No, it was because It Was My Place.And then, after he died, my husband was cleaning out the house and found...let's just say there was really good reason that my father in lawwas asked to take an early retirement, and he should have been a hell of a lot more discreet, the bastard.  That's when my husband stopped talking.Then I'd come home to a frantic phone message and turn around and drive for five hours because my goddamn idiot 'daughter-in-law' couldn't handle her husbands' tantrums so would I please come down and play whipping boy for that while she laid on the couch oblivious to it all, playing Sudoku, and her kids wiped shit all over the floor and chickens went running in and out of the kitchen door.  Because they had chickens.  And three dogs. And four ducks. In the suburbs.And there you have it. It was a whole Judy Chicago style dinner party - every single thing on my plate was a cunt.Everyone got their problems handed back to them and told where to cram them.  Except for my father in law; he croaked before I could tell him off.And this is what I learned from that terrible, terrible year:Blood is not thicker than water._________________________________________*Crazy Always Pregnant lady was upset that I didn't attend all five of her baby showers - in a year.  She is not delusional.  She just likes baby showers.  I wish I were...well, you get the idea."},

{"title": "All About My Ass", "date": "Sunday, September 29, 2019", "text": "Life is difficult when you have no ass.Hello.My name is FirstNations, and I have no ass.  Flat as a pancake.  Hank Hill assless.  No butt whatsoever.Regular slacks and jeans hang weirdly in the back, so I wear cotton knit, which hides a multitude of sins, and are baggy naturally.  My lack of an ass is nobodies business but (Ha) my own.I did not know that I didn't have an ass until Sir Mix-A-Lot came out with his dumb song 'Baby Got Back.'  Until then it was enough that I had big tits. And with those I was winning in the 'Hey baby check me out' game. That was all I needed.  (And a belt.) But after that song came out, ass afficianadoes came swarming out of the damn woodwork to sing the praises of bulgy buttocks, and videos featuring women flapping their enormous cheeks rapidly, or in time to music, became rampant.This was what the new Sexy looked like. You can't have just any old ass either - it has to be shaped like an apple.  Nothing I have is shaped like an apple. What I have is shaped like an apple that has been run over by a car.I cannot sit for very long before I am shifting about uncomfortably, no matter how soft the seat might happen to be.  The only tolerable position is to have one leg thrown up and over the left arm of the chair, which isn't always something you can do, like if you are on a train or a bus or an airplane or at a funeral.  Someone is going to have something to say about it. On a long flight, I am in a pretty fair amount of pain by the time I shuffle off that plane.  All I want to do is find a place where I can lay on my stomach.  Unfortunately, that's when my tits get their revenge.  \"Not sexy enough, huh?  Go ahead.  Try and lie on your stomach.\"I am not able to wear underwear, because they roll down the back of me as I walk, and they fall off.  No word of a lie.  My legs are curvy enough, I just don't have the wide hipbones needed to hang the waistband from.  Same reason I cannot wear pantyhose.  In fact the last time I wore pantyhose was Christmas about 2003.There I was, all dolled up for the company Christmas party.  A department heads' wife!  Seated at the front of the room!  I'd gone to a beauty parlor and had my hair and makeup done! (I know, right?)  I was wearing a beautiful holiday dress and even heels.And pantyhose.  Pantyhose pulled up all the way to my tits, where they were held in place by the band of my bra.And this worked.  I was able to walk from the car to the banquet room and wander around, and that was nice.  It wasn't until we'd been seated for awhile and I was feeling nice and comfortable, when I had to go hit the ladies room. Thinking nothing of it, I stood up, and my pantyhose went 'Flurp! Vzzzzzz!' and rolled all the way down to the middle of my thighs.Now when you are in a position like that, you can do three things.  Hold it, which HA.  I've had two kids, so that wasn't going to happen. You can clutch the rolled margin of your hose, and totter off with your hose all super baggy around your calves and ankles.  I sure in fuck wasn't going to try that, not with my husband's boss and crew and work buddies and their wives all over the place. What I did was to ooch around a bit there in my seat, just as though I were settling in, and meanwhile my hosejust continued to roll their way downward, fell down over my knees, and landed in a warm puddle around my feet. Then, my lap and legs covered by the long tablecloth, I kicked off my shoes, nudged the pile of nylon way back beneath the table, and then slipped my shoes back on and walked to the bathroom bare-legged.I wonder what the cleaning crew thought about that.This is about all I have to say about my ass. I am perfectly happy with it otherwise. It works well. It gets me around.  All it's inlets and outlets are in tiptop shape, and I don't horrify my gynocologist.  And she's not just being nice, either.  That woman has told me some stories.At sixty years old, this is the best I can hope for without resorting to surgery, and seriously...just, no.  I'll buy a granny cushion, and to hell with you, Sir Mix-A-Lot."},
{"title": "Bill Gates", "date": "Saturday, September 28, 2019", "text": "I lived in Seattle in 1984.  My daughter wasn't even a year old.  I had left my husband and cycled through three different womens' shelters before I found a place to live and got on Welfare.  Seattle in those days was pretty mellow.Now I don't mean that real shit wasn't happening.  It was, everywhere.  But in Seattle, things were being done to assist the populace.  The vast majority of those things were funded by Bill and Melinda Gates.Bill Gates saved the people of Seattle in the 1980's.  His foundations funded some incredibly forward thinking, humane programs for the homeless and the poor.  He hired stinkin' EVERYONE, be you facially tattooed, morbidly freaky or terminally white. If you could pass the Microsoft Mordor brainiac gatekeepers, you worked at Microsoft.  Period.Bill Gates went to my Dicks Drive-In.  You would see him driving his shitty car around the area, and there he'd be with his shitty haircut and bad suit behind the wheel, talking on his space age Bluetooth setup (it probably wasn't Bluetooth but some custom comware that he'd whipped up in his basement.)  He would wait in like at the Dicks for his Dick Burger and his three Dick sauces - a substance that never turned if left in it's funky little plastic container unopened - and his large fries, and then leave his enormous cannonball wallet on the drive-up counter and off he'd go, chewing on his burger.Dicks would call him and leave a message:  You left your wallet here again dude.He would come back the next day and pick it up, and they'd make sure that he got his shit together. \"Mr. Gates, are you sure you have your wallet?  Have you checked the contents? Now make sure you have it in your car.  Is it with you?  OK.  You have a good day now.\"  It held up the line forever.I would walk to that Dicks - it was only five blocks from where I was living in a railroad apartment - and be standing in line when Bill Gates came driving through, holding up the line, causing a lot of back and forth on the speaker system.  He was a neighbor.  You smiled at him or not, but you knew he was there.  Richest man in the world at the scuzzy Dicks Drive-in off Capitol Hill getting his burger and fries and Dicks' sauce in his shitty car with his shitty haircut.  Whores all over the place.  Welfare moms and kids and stamp crackers, because the Welfare office was nearby.  Hard, bad traffic.He gave that whole city hope. In the beginning, anyway.  He was a rich dork, and so he didn't quite have the rich dude thing down right.  He actually gave back to the city there for awhile, before he got interested in third world toilets.  You felt like there was hope, like you had something to fall back on, because there were so many programs being bolstered by his money.  I was a dirt-poor woman with an infant on my hip, I knew I could depend on the programs I needed at that time to be up and running.  And those programs were the difference between me and the street.  So don't talk no shit about Gates to me.  He's changed, his agenda has changed, and he finally figured out how to be a rich. But when I needed it, his cash was working for us out there in Seattle flat on our asses, and he went to our Dicks, and he was OK."},
{"title": "Yeah, More Gardening Stuff.  Fuck Yez.", "date": "Sunday, July 28, 2019", "text": "Here are some tricks, some tips, some advice, and some total bullshit.  You decide.1. Cutting back plants. This is done to prevent the (perennial) plant from blossoming too soon, or getting too tall, or both.Example:  Perennial aster.  Just regular, run of the mill, big vase shaped perennial aster. If you cut this off by one third it's height in May, it will stay compact, the plant form will broaden, and blossom time will be moved back from July to mid-August.  Believe me, in August, you want a big, massy fan of color, because your lawn is dead, everything is wilting and setting seed and looking ratty.  There in the middle of your post Apocalyptic garden is *cue angel song* Your Aster!  Glowing!  Thick with bloom!  Native pollinators are loving you! People smile as they drive by!The same can be said of most herbacious perennials.  The longer you keep them from blossoming, the broader they will become, and the more abundantly they will produce blossoms.NOTE:  Only do this once to any herbacious perennial.  You might get away with it twice with a centranthus ruber, or a monarda, or some of the coarser campanulas, but more than three times is killing it.  All you guys reading this are laughing now.  I know you are.2. Cutting back shrubs/woody perennials. Anything that has bark is a woody perennial, and this is basically shrubs and small trees. OK.  With this the rule of thumb is, cut hard to shape in February or March, and then cut to thin after blooming (if it blooms.) Here is why you have to thin, which means cutting off mass. Small trees like ninebark and magnolia will start putting out the branches right after they bloom.  And that is fine, until over time the plant gets as thick as you want it to get.  After that, go up in there after it blossoms and start cutting out small branches (mass,) or else you'll end up with a huge beast come winter, and if it ices over, that small tree might very well end up torn apart by the sheer amount of ice that can form and add dead weight to all that mass.  I lost a gorgeous Mountain Ash like this - and Mt. Ash qualifies as a small tree, even though they get huge here.  We got an ice storm, I hadn't bothered to cut out the mass, and come winter it iced up and half of it tore away from the trunk. The whole tree died two years later - and that was a tree that I'd been carrying around with me from rental to rental for fifteen years before I planted it here.  It was fucking heartbreaking.Star magnolia is a waterhog - meaning the more it's watered, the more it grows, and that watery growth is weak and excessive.  Keep an eye on it, and if it's looking really massy - thick and impentrable - in the canopy around July?  Get up in there with the loppers.  I have a mature specimen that I have to take care of in midsummer and early winter, and it's absolutely worth it because STAR MAGNOLIA.Buddleia is also a waterhog.  If it gets overwatered during the summer, which is something that I am guilty of, it will put on all this huge angular weak, heavy mass.  Come winter it will literally tear itself in half in a high wind, or given a very rainy week.  Fortunately, assuming this has happened and you're standing there going \"Oh shit my buddleia tore itself in half\" you can choose the half you like, leave it rooted there, and cut off the other half; just completely cut it away at the point of breakage.  Boom. Then cut away half the height of the part you are keeping, backfill with compost if necessary, and haul all the discard out to the compost heap.  It WILL come back.Hazel/Filbert:  It's a funny tree.  You can let it grow as it will from seed, and in four years you will have a very nice tree.That is also when it will begin suckering.  And I mean suckering like a mad motherfucker.  Sudden straight poles that do nothing but have leaves without fruit will come shooting up from the trunk and the branch axils for no good reason, the way an apple tree does.  You always have to be cutting on a hazel, and you have to be very careful about sanitation.  Seal the cuts with Vasoline.3. Sanitation in the garden.No I am not high.  Make sure your loppers, secateurs or sawblade has been swizzled in a bucket of bleachy water.  About one teaspoon of bleach to your basic plastic pickle bucket of water.  Sozzle that blade around in there between each cut, if you are working on a single plant that you suspect has a fungus or other disease.  When you move to another plant, sanitize your equipment again.  Slosh it around in the bleach water.And speaking of excessive sanitation and bullshit, the Cornus Californica...my favorite dogwood tree in the world.  It is a water hog, it will come on with lots of soft, heavy mass, and even with benign neglect it wants trimming almost constantly because the branches take off in weird directions for no logical reason.  This happens in the wild, too. Unfortunately it is also horribly prone to Anthracnose, which is a fungal disease that roses are also prone to.  This shit took out my beautiful, beautiful tree after fifteen years, and I blame myself for having gone from trimming off an infected rose bush right to the dogwood, without sanitizing my tools between jobs. I kept it going with my sulphur-water-castille mix for another two years, and then I just cut it off slick with the ground. Once you get a badly diseased plant in the garden, tear it out AND BURN IT.  If you can't burn it, wet it all down with pure bleach.  The dead wood, root mass and the dirt that clings to it will spread the disease otherwise.4. DIVIDING PLANTSGasp! Clutch the pearls!  This is so freaky and terrifying!  Whatever shall I do?Well I'll tell ya.Do not divide plants that are in bloom. Period.If you must, cut off ALL THE BLOSSOMS FIRST.  This way the plant will receive a biochemical signal telling it to direct its efforts to building callus on severed roots and growing new roots to reach for more sustenance.If a perennial plant has two stems that come up separately, not from a single trunk, now, but separately - from a single root mass?  Stick a shovel between the stems and lever half of that plant out of the ground.  Backfill the hole with dirt or compost, water it until it puddles, and walk away with your brand new half a plant.  You can stick it in the ground somewhere else, or you can compost it.  Your choice.  It's just that simple.If there is a huge clump of stems coming from a single root mass, like a hosta or a daylily?  Stick a shovel into the middle of it and lever half of it out.  See above.  Just that easy.The key is to have everything ready beforehand. First, cut off all the flowers and seedheads. Have ready at hand a shovel, hose, (hole dug and watered in heavily to receive the division) sharp shovel, keyhole saw to get through the roots if necessary, and dirt or compost to backfill.  All that in place and ready, it will go smooth as silk. No fear.  No secret substances or unnecessary surgical procedures.  Water the half a plant that's staying, backfill, water in again, and walk away.Expect that these halves will look like shit for a week or more. (Particularly the one you threw into the compost heap, right.)  Then you will begin to see signs of new growth.  If there is a hot, windy spell of weather then water the divisions again, deeply. Once.This is pretty basic shit, kids.  Plants are pretty basic things.  (I am not counting raising orchids or conservatory growing here because I know exactly jack shit about those methods.)  True, every plant does have conditions that it prefers.  Go to Daves Garden.com for more articles, information, answers to your questions, and growing information on just about every plant and variety of plant you can imagine.Here is a screenshot of the Plants and Information page.See that little box (rounded off) with Search DG in it right at the left hand side up top there?  Type in \"small trees\" or \"Carnation\" or \"home recipes for soil testing\" or whatever you like.  \"Apple trees\"  \"growing mushrooms\"  \"What is this bug?\"  You will find so much information on the forums and in the articles it's just stupid.That's all I got.  It's up to you now.  Go. Garden. Get outside."},
{"title": "Jesus, more stuff about gardening?", "date": "Wednesday, July 24, 2019", "text": "Yes. Suck it up.I like color. I like a lot of colors all at once.  I have no time for pastels.  This is why, when we got our house, I planned very carefully.  It worked like a charm for me.First:Remember that if you want a garden, green Will Be The Dominant Color.There is no escaping this unless you want to grow an all white or an all bronze garden, which can be done and looks STUNNING, particularly the white garden against a modern, Cubist kind of house. Just don't paint your house some stupid-ass color.Second: Don't Paint Your House A Stupid-Ass color.That goes for the majority of us humans.  A very few of us have a way with color harmonies and can get away with purple houses and cadmium yellow and so forth.  I do not have this kind of color sense.  Most of us do not.  If you paint your house pale titty pink, seafoam green, or baby blue, you've got to live with it.  It will be really difficult to plan a flower garden around those colors because you now have three colors to work with - grass green (yellow and blue make green) and your stupid pastel house color choice.  Say goodbye to the color red in all its shades.  Say goodbye to most of the purples. This leaves more green, yellow, blue, white, orange and pink.  And this can be done acceptably.  I've seen it.  But what I've seen more of  is a seafoam green house with a huge honkin' gross Cherry Red rhododendron out front. NO.Third:  What I did.Paint your house a neutral color.  I painted mine a light ash grey with black trim and it looks AWESOME.  I can get away with anything out in the garden.  Similarly most of the subdued tans and browns. You have created the perfect backdrop for your garden, and the world is your colorful oyster! So what about white?Everything you plant will be fighting that Huge White Mass back there.  Reds will read black, and so will most mid to dark blues.  White tends to suck all the life out of color, and even the most saturated will appear pale.   This is the house that will support a huge, flaming red rhododendron with grace and style.  In fact, go nuts with the hard, big, bright, saturated blossoms and leaves in front of a white house. This is the house that you can plant the biggest, blowsiest hydrangea next to without a care.  The advantage of white is that you can Go Big and Go Bright.  And you should.Fourth:  Use perennials AND annuals in large beds.Once that perennial stops producing blossoms, there's an absence where there used to be color.  But annuals will keep your garden looking nice and colorful all season long.  Scatter the seeds around and you'll be very happy with the result. (NOTE-do not use a wildflower mix for this.  Wildflower mixes contain a lot of grasses, and once you have them, you'll always have them. Go online and buy flower seed from a good company like Richters. )Remember, annuals have to put all their eggs into one basket, so they flower repeatedly all season long.  Their sole aim is to make viable seeds. Annuals try harder.  Fifth: Black leaved perennials are absolutely essential in a colorful garden.   They set off the saturated colors and bring out the pastels.  I like heuchera Palace Purple and Silver Frost. Black mondo grass works in dry shade, and Bronze Nepeta \"Six Hills Giant\" is a strong upright note in full sun, particularly in the late summer. There are dark, dark bronze Japanese Maples that you can let creep along at ankle height, or at least keep trimmed low.  Actaea \"Brunette\" is another tall note, and likes shade.  Stonecrop \"Postmans Pride\" will eventually come pure black after a few years of being dark bronze. Another stonecrop, \"Purple Emperor\" is it's big brother, and flourish in full sun.  There is even a black form of Queen Anne's lace that is absolutely stunning; Anthriscus sylvestris \"Ravens Wing\". You can leave it as a mound of  leaves, or let it shoot and form the familiar umbrella of white blossoms.  Ajuga \"Black Scallop\" will creep about and form mats by way of stolons, and give you a nice little spike of blue flowers too. Coleus \"Black Prince\" is an annual, and pays it's keep.Let's visit our white house again, and bring our black plants. Remember Go Big? There is where you would use a cotynus \"Velvet Cloak\", also known as smokebush.  It gets TALL.  Also the bulb colocasia esculenta, aka elephants ear, comes in a pure smoke black, and the leaves are huge. The dahlia \"Bishop of Llandalf\" has pure black leaves and stems. It gets really tall, and has a really, really red flower. You can do this with a white house!  Similarly, Cannas  have cultivars with black foliage, which usually bear a screaming red flower. Plant a small tree like the Ninebark, physocarpus opulifolius \"Diabolo\".  Or a big tree, like Brone Maple.I have a list here of my favorite, bulletproof, showstopping perennials, and you, you lucky thing, get to read it.  So let's get the technical shit out of the way.I live in a Zone 6 (USDA) climate.  I garden on heavy silt/clay soil.  When I started, I had to amend it to a depth of four feet, and open the soil up with lots of compost and general plant frag mixed into it, and then let it rest for the winter before planting the next spring.  It is still very hard stuff, and cracks during the summer.  I could have chosen to work with raised beds, but clay soil is wonderfully fertile, and I tend to get chubby if I don't get out and work, and so I dug beds instead.  Plus playing in the dirt.When I describe a color, I am using the Pantone scale and their names for the shades.  You can look that up online in Images.These days you MUST go online and research the pretty face that captured your heart at the plant store.  Write that name down, or just look it up on your phone if you're all technical and shit (I still have a flip phone. Sue me.)  An invaluable source is Daves Garden.com.  I cannot speak highly enough of this site.If a plant doesn't have a tag, don't buy it.If it does, pay attention to the type of plant, as \"Carnation\" and the cultivar name, usually something snazzy like \"Red Ribbons\".  Now go to Daves Garden.com and enter that information into the search box.  Then scroll down a bit, and you'll run into all kinds of information about this specific plant, including reviews from different people in different climates, and all of this is just pure gold.First, find out if it needs a high or a low SOIL PH.  This is vital.  How do I check my soil? 1. Call your County Extension Service and ask.  They have extensive soil maps and it's free!  Or, 2. enter \"At-home soil testing recipes\" into the search box at Daves' Garden.  One of these recipes uses cabbage and water!  You don't have to get all precise.  If a plant wants to live on alkaline soil, and you have acidic soil, that plant will die no matter what you do, short of growing it in a container with special ph adjusted medium.  Well, hearts break, and hearts mend.  Continue your quest.You will kill plants.  Plants will die for no visible reason.  I still kill plants (usually by overwatering.) My plants still die for no reason.  But The More You Know, the less likely this is to happen.Perennial means it comes back every year.  It might die back to the ground, or just drop leaves, but it will come back next Spring.My soil tends to run neutral-slightly acidic.  I go with that.  And given your soil is like my soil, and your climate is like my climate, here's some bulletproof plants that will come back year after year and rock your world.Roses:Munstead Wood.  Deep dark dusky purple red, heavenly rich true rose aroma, clean leaves, laughs at high winter winds, freezing temps and dragons and aliens and everything.  It is a four to five foot shrub, which means it's kind of a dome shape if let to do what it wants. Let it.  This is the rose that should be in every garden in the world.  It's a David Austen, and Dave, ya done good.The Fairy:This will give you tiny little ping-pong ball sized blossoms - but read on!It comes in three main colors - an unusual deep pink-the one I have - a pale baby pink, and swan white (I also have this.)  It's classified as a shrub which in real life (as far as this particular rose goes) means that if you leave it along you'll end up with a big, big, truck-sized lump of a plant. I've seen one that was left to run wild that had carpeted an entire hillside, and this is because if a cane stays in touch  with the ground for a month or so, it will sent out a root and start a whole new crown.  But this will not happen, because you will keep it cut back.  And it might require staking and tying for the first two years. Ha.  The work of a mere moment. The reward will be a plant that is in vibrant bloom from spring until fall, and even, weirdly, sometimes into midwinter, on new growth. Trusses can carry up to, no lie, seventy-five buds.  More commonly they range about five to fifteen per truss.  It smells very faintly of rose, except sometimes, for some reason, it smells very strongly indeed of citrus-rose.  It has a huge flush of blossom in the spring, and this means literally more blossom than leaf - and the flowers will slowly fade, and finally experience petal drop - except that new growth will be pushing out new blossoms here and there in pom-poms of blossoms. Now you can leave it like this.  But if you want another huge flush of blossoms instead, trim the spent buds off all the branches.  Good luck.  The plant will respond by pushing lots of new growth, and blossoms.This is the only rose in my experience that you can throw at the ground and forget.Rosa Rubrifolia:  This has leaves and stems of dusky bronze, small red prickles, and white, small, apple-blossom type flowers in May. It smells strongly of true rose. It only flowers once a year. But it forms big, shining bronze hips in clusters, which is very pretty against the matte color of the plant.  And then come the first freeze, all those hips turn screaming red.  It grows strongly upward, like a vase, and then will lop over a little on top. Just a very pretty plant all the way 'round, and can take partial shade!Daylilies:If you have low spots in your yard, this is where you want to plant a daylily.  They'll do fine anywhere except in day-long shade, but the Common Daylily will will grow happily in standing water or shallow running water.  Yup. The same one your grandma had.Mahogany Stripe.  While most daylilies tend to be clumpy and rather graceless, this is the exception to the rule.  Thin, strap-like leaves arch over, and tall, mahogany-brown stems start up bold and straight high above the leaves, and bear from five to ten buds.  Each will open into a true, saturated yellow blossom with a mahogany stripe running up the outside of each petal.  This is an exceptionally fine daylily.Bella Lugosi:  This is a robust daylily. The broad strap-like leaves arch over and tall green stems the width of a crayon start up just over the cluster , each stem bearing from three to ten buds, which open in the Most Dramatic Blossom.  It is a very sturdy blossom, as wide as your hand. The petals are broad, and their edges are slightly ruffled.  The color is a deep, dark, dark burgundy, slightly diamond dusted, blending into a bright lime green throat.  Like Dracula's cape with its red lining.   And limes.Hemerocallis Lilioaesphodelus: This forms a clump of long strap shaped leaves, and the blossoms carry very high above the crown on fine sturdy stems.  They are large, trumpet shaped,  butter, or lemon yellow, and It Smells Good!Other Lilies:Classic Tiger Lily - you cannot go wrong.  They just keep on truckin'. You get a single stem covered in alternating short green lanceolate leaves. The very top carries the flower buds, and they bloom from the bottom to the top, one to five at a time, for a period of a month.  Blossoms are large and orange, and have maroon freckles on the inside.  The pollen is deep burnt orange and will stain your clothes and skin, but not permanently.The blossoms face downward, outward and upward, and can run twenty five buds to a stem. Don't put this in a windy place, although it will do fine with the occasional rain or windstorm.  After five years, it will have made a bulb the size of a grapefruit, and the stalk will be as big around as a shovel handle.  I have one in the yard that is six feet tall!Double Tiger:  The above, but with two sets of petals instead of one.  Tends to run a bit pale, in the orange sherbet range.  Still a very nice plant.Any of these lilies will grow here: Tiger Lilies, Star Gazers, Trumpets, Madonna lillies, Turks Caps, Orienpets and cardiocrinums. Look them up at Dave's Garden.com. The colors they've come out with lately are legion, and grow on a plant that shares the familys' sturdy, tall habit.  I have a weird one I found, with deep red-bricky-underoxygenated blood colored petals, very shiny.  It's sort of  macabre, and I love it.Campanulas, aka Bellflower:Campanula pocharskyana: A prostrate form.  It has a fine round, ruffly little leaf and the blossoms fringe the plant very generously for two months.  This is what you want to plant in a whiskey barrel or an old washtub, because it drapes excellently. I use it as a ground cover under a tree and it's wonderful there too.  Once the blossoms have fallen, clip away the seedheads, and you'll get a repeat bloom.Campanula Glomerata:  A stout upright form, rather coarse and a little fuzzy-prickly, which spreads by way of stolons (look it up.)  The blossoms appear in a perfect sphere at the top of the plant, and once those have played out, cut them away for a repeat bloom from the leaf axils of the rest of the stem. 1 to 3 feet tall in an established planting. This is a good, strong blue.  It also spreads by way of stolons, and if it gets out of hand, just stick a shovel in there and take away the part that's gone astray. Refill with soil or compost, of course.Tall Campanula:  It gets tall.  About five to six feet tall, after a couple of years.  The blossoms are bell shaped and range up the stalks.  Another good, strong blue for the garden.  The stems and leaves can be a little prickly.  Once they're done, cut them off and you'll get a re-bloom from a much shorter plant.Heucheras:Palace Purple:  This is grown for the color and the form of the leaves, which are kind of like a geraniums leaves, and very, very dark bronze. After three years, they will be for all intents and purposes black as sin.  They throw up a few tall stems of tiny white, bell shaped flowers, which is a pretty effect, but clear them away as soon as they're finished or the plant will play out over the course of the summer and get straggly.  Why this is, I don't know.  I've had mine in the ground for seven years and they're as big around as your average stand fan.  You want some drama underneath your rose bushes?  Surround them with these.  Instant elegance. This plant can take full sun, but likes partial and light shade best, so it's like a match made in heaven here.  Roses + heuchera \"Palace Purple\".  Go. Plant.Purple Frost:  same as the above, but with a white cast, or shimmer, over the dark, dark color of the leaves.  This is a designers' decision here.  I have it, it's very pretty, it works well, and it saves the black underplantings from being too uniform.  The silver really gleams, too.  Wonderful plant.Green Heuchera: This grows wild here in the PNW, and it likes shade.  That's it.  It is a beautiful plant, and I use it everywhere.ArtemesiasThe rule is high and dry with these guys.Silver Mound is a silver mound. The leaves are silver, and very finely cut, shiny and feathery.  It looks like a little cloud sitting there. Plant it in a high spot in your yard.  It does not like constantly wet soil or leaves.  It withers in the winter, but comes back from the deadest looking thing you ever saw to be something graceful and pretty.Valerie Finnis, aka Japanese Mugwort:  This is an upright single wand of paper white, nicely formed leaves that spreads and masses by way of stolons (look it up.)  If you don't like where it is, pull it out.  In a mixed border, you can create a nice effect by letting them come up here and there, or in ribbons or swaths.  Cut off the blossom as soon as you see buds, otherwise the plant will get ratty looking.Clematis:Radar Love.  Yes, that's really it's name.  Now this is exotic as heck in these parts, and I don't know why, because it is a very agreeable, easy plant.  First of all, it has a downward-facing yellow blossom. Yes, Yellow.  Bright saturated yellow blossoms which are thick, oddly like lemon peels, and are about the size of a small cocktail lemon.  When the blossom falls, it leaves behind galactic puffs of silvery, soft, gleaming filaments.  Meanwhile the foliage is agreeably apple green, and sets the blossoms off nicely. It likes to mass, and will spread wide as well as tall.  Cover a fenceline with this, and you'll have a thing in the air....Radar Love.Yes.  I said it.Jackmanii:  This is grandma's clematis.  It has a blue-purple blossom with a modest violet-purple stripe.  It climbs, it spreads, and it holds up for a nice long time.  Once the blossoms drop, you still have a very nice plant which, if you have trained it ornamentally ( encouraged the vines to clamber up and onto things using zip ties or twist ties - once it lays on a surface, the stems of it's leaves with curl tightly around it and take over from there) it will be a nice, sculptural ornament until fall. Once the leaves fall off, it's ugly as homemade soup, but if you've trained it artistically, it makes a nice, black, goth effect, like a hell-creature is stuck to your porch or the side of your house.Jackmanii, like all clematis (except Radar Love, oddly) has one problem, and that is Clematis Wilt. In this climate, it will happen occasionally, given a damp, foggy, motionless few spring days.  Your plant will grow a few feet and then all the vines will die off and you'll freak out thinking the plant has died, but it hasn't, so cheer up lil' buckaroo.  The trick is to give the area of the plants crown a good spraying in the springtime, just when they're starting to grow, with sulphur mixed with water.  Again, look this up at Dave's Garden.  You are not killing the earth.  You are not poisoning the soil.  You are eradicating a particular strain of fungus from a limited area for a limited time.  Sulphur occurs naturally.  It's just sulphur.  A small bag of it will last you literally for years, and you won't be using more than a half-teaspoon of it per spray bottle and be giving that area it five or so squirts once a year, if that, so get over it.  Visit Daves Garden for instructions.  Dave knows all.Alpine Blue:  Now, there's several types of clematis all claiming to be Alpine blue.  A small-flowered one with pure cyan blossoms, a medium sized one whose blossoms run to indigo with black stamens, and a large one, with regularly sized big blossoms, that is never the same color every year, ranging from steel blue, Egyptian blue, to Byzantium purple.  All three of these clematis are very nice and quite vigorous.  Just, be ready to be surprised.  The Alpines will give you the truest, most saturated blues of all the clematis varieties - when they feel like it.TulipsAny tulip your heart desires will grow here, even the exotics and the speciosas.  Grab a catalogue and go NUTS.  Me being me, I like the speciosas, which are the most lovely small, colorful plants you could imagine and should be grown far more widely.  I cannot say enough about them.  They are unexpected and delightful in the springtime.  Of the taller varieties, I prefer Black Parrot - although any of the parrot line are going to give you a superior plant, and here's why. They have sturdy, relatively short stems, attractive foliage, and they branch.  So unlike the Darwins, which is your typical tall single stem with one single cup shaped blossom, you get a sturdy plant that can stand up to the rain and wind, a magnificent array of color and blossom form, and they rebloom.  Take that, Darwin.Caution:  Snowdrop, grape hyacinth and mountain bluebells will spread wildly.  But of the three, it is the Snowdrop which will break into your house, drink milk from the carton, drive your car and use your credit card. Now, it's also a charming small flower, and massed around a tree trunk they look lovely, but don't expect it to stay there.  It will send out scouts and colonize your entire property.  You will find it, I swear to god, coming up in your houseplants.  I do not know by what mechanism that occurs, but it occurs.  It will come up in your yard, which is charming, but wherever there is one, there will be ten.  I've dug out clumps of the small, white, grape sized bulbs all clustered together that were the size of a cantaloupe, if a cantaloupe were creepy and warty and white and grew underground.  Left to go without division of the bulb mass, it will send up grasslike leaves in a tight carpet, and very few blossoms.  This is geometric growth in it's purest form.  The more there is, the more there will be, except even more-er.Grape hyacinth and mountain bluebell do this to a lesser degree.  But rather than coming up all over Hells half acre, they spread outward from one location, and you'll find them stacked four deep if you dig up a clump.  Keep the largest bulbs, and put the rest into the compost heap, (or the ditch across the street, like I do.) Again, if you let them go, you'll get a big patch of grassy leaves and very few blossoms.Daffodils will also diminish if they aren't dug and the clumps of bulbs separated and sorted every other year, otherwise, yup. A big clump of leaves and one lone blossom pining for the fjords.Narcissus poeticus, Pheasant Eye Jonquil:  see Daffodils.IrisesGerman Iris, grandmas' iris, fleur de lis:  These come in every color, form and size you can imagine.  The plant comes up from big tubers that look like ginger root, and come up at a right angle to the tuber, which likes to protrude a bit from the ground or lie just below it, so the first time you plant one, you might have to put a rock or a brick on top of the root to keep it from tipping over.  Once they catch hold, your worries are over. Remove the brick.  Rejoice.You must like the fans of blue-grey foliage, though, because that's what you're going to get for the majority of the year.  And they are very nice.  This iris blossoms in the early spring, right around the same time you're getting the occasional hailstorm, which will shred the blossoms.  So, two weeks of whatever blossom you like, and there are some true beauties, followed by the main show; the leaves.  Plan for the fans of leaves and plant accordingly.Bulb irises:  Go crazy.  They're short lived, about three years, in my experience, and then the plant dies.  This is nature. Buy some more.Japanese, Monet, etc. root-mass irises: Lose your mind.  Again, like the German iris, the main show is going to be the foliage, which grows in tall, grass-green agreeable clumps (4-5 ft on a mature specimen.)  Bear in mind that these too grow right about the time in Spring when we get hailstorms.  The blossoms will be shredded, spotted, or just torn off the plant altogether, so if you like the big saucer-blossomed types, you've been warned.My favorite Iris of all time is Iris Chrysographes.  Pictures do not do it justice.  It is graceful in all it's parts, and the blossoms look like dragonflies, very elegant in form.  And they run from deepest, deepest purple to coal black, and have a single, thin golden line that runs down the middle of each petal.  It also branches, so you get a month of blossom time instead of two weeks.Crocosmia:Lose your mind. It wants full sun, and not to be set in a low place in your yard.  That's it.  You will get glorious fountains of beautiful, beautiful flowers and foliage from June (depending on the particular variety) into late August.  Look it up. An extravagant and graceful plant in all it's parts.Gladiolas:Buy them all.  Caveat:  they MUST be staked.  Now you can plan ahead when you order them and get shorter varieties, because really, do you need six foot tall top-heavy, completely unstable plants that fall over and break in half?  No.  No you do not.  Not that you can't stake them, there's nothing objectionable about it, it's just not my idea of a party. The smaller varieties are far more stable, and just as pretty, or as tacky, as your heart desires.Let's face facts here. A gladiola can come off pretty goddamn tacky because most popular varieties are very flamboyant and almost unnaturally symmetrical. Just letting you know how I feel about gladiolas.  Rock.The Asters (you know, daisies.)Excellent Perennial Asters:Not the things you buy out front of the grocery store in the fall - those are not perennial.  These you get at the nursery, and read the tags, people.The type called 'common perennial aster' are the most agreeable plants. They come in just about every color of the rainbow, want full sun, and that's it. You can shape them, you can forget them,  they come in short, medium and tall, they rebloom if they're cut back, and the blue ones in particular draw the native pollinators like, well, bees to honey.  They will literally be fogged over with flying insects, particularly bumblebees, and they bloom in the late summer, early fall.  Mine want to try to bloom during the spring sometimes, and depending on my mood, I'll either let this happen, or I'll cut them back about halfway before the blossoms open.  They'll come back in a month and blossom.Helenium:  Plant.  Watch.  Beautiful sunset colored blossoms from June onward until August. Likes full sun.  Boom shakalaka.Brown-Eyed Susan:  Bears a beautiful bright, saturated canary yellow (also comes in other colors) daisy type flower with a fluffy brown button in the middle. Very sturdy and upright and not at all coarse. They have odd leaves in that they come in various sizes and shapes, and are a big round smooth paddle instead of the small fuzzy lanceolate kind you find on most common asters.Echinacea, Purple Coneflower:These only last for three years. But if you divide it the second year, it starts the clock all over for both - and now you have two Echinaceas!  This might be a little more than you want to do, but they come in such vivid colors and interesting variations that I think it's worth it.  They are tall and sturdy, and make a real vivid point of interest, particularly that sunset-colored center.Crappy Asters:Shasta DaisiesI will not grow a Shasta Daisy.  They smell bad, they look weedy, and life is just too short for this nonsense.  There is a double-double cultivar that looks nice, though.  I don't grow it either.Black Eyed Susans, Gloriosa Daisies:  I've grown these, and while they're beautiful, they flop over and break themselves off.  Rain, wind, a cat walks past, or Just Because. Nope.Mint:Common Mint: For a shady, damp area, alongside the north side of a house, this is the shit.  Any type will do, and they come in a huge variety.Bee Balm: My personal favorite because it smells strongly of lemons when it is brushed.  Cut those blossoms off, though, because it will jump and take over your world.Monarda:This is a member of the mint family, and the leaves are used in Constant Comment tea and smell good!  It spreads by stolons, and will form rock hard clumps and strangle itself. You solve this by sticking a shovel straight into the middle of the clump, cutting out a piece, and backfilling with dirt or compost.  They come in a variety of sizes and colors, and want to grow in a patch; you don't just get a single monarda, in other words.  It can be left for about three years before you have to perform surgery, and if it wanders too far, just pluck those stems out of the ground and there you go.  I grow the very tall Jacob Cline selection, which is a red shade, a weird mix of Pantone Flame and Pink Yarrow.  I also grow the dwarf variety in true purple, and it wanders around and adds volume to your color balance effortlessly. When the top pom-pom begins to get ratty looking, cut them down to the second whorl of leaves and they will rebloom. Blooms from late May through to early August, and sometimes later if cut back.Pretty weeds:Centranthus Ruber: also known as Red Valerian and Jupiters' Beard.  The best thing to do is to look this up online and pick a color. The flowers come in spires off the end of the branches.  Its found most commonly in pale pink with a dark pink throat, and a raging cerise with a fuchsia throat.  You can get it in white, you can get it in dark red.  And once you have it, you'll have it for good.  It spreads by fairies, like a dandelion (my botanical terminology fails me here.)  The leaves and stems are a light blue-green, on the jade side, with a spreading habit, and very pretty.  If you don't like where it is, it breaks off and there you go.Linarea pupurea:  A very vertical presence, and an attractive one too. Strongly upright, vase shaped, and toppled with a spire of little blue flowers with a pink throat.  The leaves and stems are a middle green to grey green. It spreads by seed, and once again, once you have it, you have it for good.  Still, like the centranthus, if you don't like it, it cracks off readily, and you're free!It's presence in the garden reads light blue grey.  It looks best massed, or with other things close by.Trees and shrubs:Elder:I grow Sambucus niger, which is deep purple-black.  There is a lace-leaved variety which is also very nice.  In the middle of spring they will put out an umbel of screaming pink, tiny blossoms. It will set tiny black berries. You can keep an elder cut down to form a shrub, or let them go, and you will get a nice small tree about eight feet high.  either way, no issues whatsoever.  The green leaved wild varieties are just as showy and agreeable.  They have white flowers, and will set either a Christmas red or a pure black berry, which is extremely pretty.  Birds love them.  Bees adore them.Dogwood:The red osier variety blossoms in umbels of small white flowers, not the big, four petaled blossom you see on other varieties. The flowers last for three weeks. These flowers, like the blue asters, are a magnet for pollinators.  The whole tree will be humming with them.  New growth comes in flaming red all year round. It is a very nice small tree indeed.Note: Do NOT hack it off to the ground so that it comes up like a fan.  Everybody does this and it's just played.  This is such a graceful small tree in it's own right; let it free!Magnolia:They all seem to grow here.  My preference is the Star Magnolia, because the flower form is unusual, swan white and gorgeous in effect,  and the petals doesn't end up all over the ground looking like used Kleenexes the way the large-blossomed varieties do.  Just my preference.  If I had the room, I'd grow a big old pink grandma magnolia and let it roam free.  And rake a lot.Rhododendron:Go nuts.  I do not grow it because I do not like it, which is just me. You only get a week of blossoms, the rain knocks them off, the wind knocks them off, they fall on the ground and look like gross used Kleenexes.  It loves this biome, though. I've seen hundred year old specimens the size of a two storey house. Truth.A reminder:  some of the hardest colors in the flower world grow on rhodies.  When you get a red, you get a Pantone Cherry Red in huge pompoms all over the plant. If you live in a pale pink or a sea green house, this is going to look gross. Similarly the purples. There is nothing uglier than a red and a purple rhodie planted together.  Unless it is a red and pale lavender rhodie planted together.  Yech. And you are going to have this plant for a long, long time.  It will outlive you, in fact.  Think.They come in a huge variety of colors and shades.  If I grew one, it would be the one with the Pantone Hyacinth Violet - colored blossoms. I've seen this as a mature specimen and it is truly stunning.Blueberry:Yes, blueberry.  It stays small, it can be trimmed into a nice shape, it is an attractive plant, and you get blueberries.  Bonus point:  It turns flaming orange red in the fall!(Now, you can buy a shrub called \"Burning Bush\" which is a nice, inoffensive shrub.  All it does is sit there and be small, green and agreeable, until first frost, when it turns screaming incandescent red - and then the leaves drop, boom. Done.   I say choose the blueberry.  The little white blossoms are pretty, the bees love them, you get blueberries, and fall color.)Stewartia:This is a small-10 ft tops - deciduous tree that has an upright habit, so instead of forming a canopy, it forms a loose spire.  It has a pretty green leaf, interesting peel-ish bark, and it gets covered with white flowers in June.  Pretty white flowers like large apple blossoms!  It's just a really good, interesting little tree.Japanese maples:Red Lace Leaf mapleYellow Moon mapleRed common as dirt Japanese mapleThe Red Lace Leaf Maple will form the most graceful, beautiful plant, if given time and patience.  As in years.  Sometimes this tree will slump down and make a little Mt. Fuji, which is nice if that's what you go for.  I trained mine into a rising spiral, so that the light and air could move through it and show off the form.  Now, I didn't do a really formal clip job on it, I just selected for shape and left it natural.  It is truly a gracious little tree, and will eventually end up from five to ten feet tall, but count on five feet.  If you never cut it, it will just kind of crawl along the ground and eventually make a little haystack of red leaves, which if this is what you want then you do you. The leaves are dark red and finely cut.The Yellow Moon maple is a sweetheart of a plant.  Just a sweetheart.  The leaves are golden on red stems, small and palmate. The bark is smooth, and it likes to form a canopy.Red common as dirt Japanese maple:  This is the one you see in civic plantings and in peoples yards.  It will eventually get about ten to fifteen feet tall.  It carries it's leaves in plateaus - think of a stack of different sized plates. There you have it's form. The leaves are much smaller than sugar maples or bigleafs, and will stay a bricky red, with new growth being brighter.  Tough as nails and pretty, too.Buddleia:They all grow here.  The yellows, the blues, the pinks, etc.  Buddleia loves this area like a dog loves to sniff butt.  It is a wandy, open shrub-small tree. It's form is very loose and spreading, and when in full bloom, left to it's own devices in the middle of a yard or a planting, is a very pretty and graceful sight.Buddleia davidii:  This plant is classified as an invasive species in Washington State and British Columbia.  Do I have one? I've got four.  Is it invasive?  Only near watercourses, along creeks and rivers.  I am a smoooooth criminal.  It's leaves are silver underneath and green grey on top, lanceolate, and each branch ends in a crowded spire of bright blue little flowers with orange throats.  It smells like honey.  Gloriously. Intoxicatingly.  I have it planted all around my bedroom window, and in the summer?  Oh Myyyyyyyy.Buddleia \"Black Knight\":  Has a dark, dark blue black flower.  A little more upright than the davidii.  I bought it because a. Buddleia is pretty and smells like honey, and b. John Cleese.Buddleia 'Lo and Behold'  \"Purple Haze.\"   This is a dwarfed version, hence the cutey cute 'Lo and Behold' line name, and so it does not have as open or wandy a form as the others.  You get a six foot tall bush that you can trim and shape that comes on strong with glorious long spires of purple flowers against forest green matte leaves.  It is wonderful.  And face it, like I wasn't going to get a plant named 'Purple Haze', right?  This is worth having. It's a little gem. It is bright, saturated Pantone purple. God I love it.BarberryTake your choice.  Green to black, red to pink, variegated, you name it, they have it.  Barberry is what you want to have if you have problem neighbors. It doesn't grow thorns, it grows thousands of long, thin needles tipped with fomic acid, which break off in the skin and causes an itching allergic reaction.  If you had a hedge of these and kept it pruned so it grew very dense and tight, you wouldn't have a worry in the world, no matter what time of year. I have one, a miniature that I use as a specimen, because I am horribly allergic to it, and break out in hives.  It isn't pretty. The problems with barberry are a. If you accidentally fall into it, because Oh fuck no. and b. Dogs love to piss on barberry.  They'll pass up everything else to piss on a barberry, and I have no idea why, but I've seen it.  If you rinse the plant off when you start seeing an area that's yellowing, no worries, it will grow back.  If not, the entire plant will get pissed to death by dogs.  Possibly cats and other animals too.The solution?  Put a large rock next to the plant.  Or an old milk can, or what have you.  Animals that mark are tagging their territory.  Nine times out of ten they will choose a large, flat, unbroken surface over a plant to leave their messages. Just keep that rinsed off and it's all good.Now, if you have a hedge of them?  Animals like to mark significant points of interest in their environment, like tree trunks and big rocks and the corners of things, like buildings - and hedges.  Put the large rock, milk can, old car or what have you at the outside corner of the hedge.You see what you can learn here?"},

Faint rose aroma.Broadway Shorty:  An otherwise nameless miniature rose, perfectly double with octagonal blossoms colored screaming apricot red,  smelling of true rose.Night Owl:  Actually, the name of this rose is Night Owl already.  The petals are ice-white on the outside and rich lavender purple on the inside.  Very striking, and smells strongly of citrus rose.Runaround Sue:  A thin, wandy, wavy red rose, smallish doubled blossoms that go from stop sign red to red-black and hang on for dear life.  The stems are thin and long and go every which way.  It will try and grab you.Anne Boleyn:  The Apothecary Rose, simple double blossoms all the way down each wand, colored a hard blue-scarlet that ages to a dark, dark red, like evil roses in a vampire garden.  Smells heavenly, and heavily, of citrus.Mrs. Pioneer:  Zephyrine Drouhin, a climbing rose that produces apple-sized, baby-pink blossoms;  complex doubles shaped like four leaved clovers, inclined to cabbage, with a 'Persian cat nose' green dot in the center.

Thick, saturated rose fragrance, double blossoms that come in lush bunches, and the color -! Imagine a red ember that changes shades with every slight breeze, coated with a faint white haze of ash. It's all here. The blossoms look lit from within.  The outer petal is hot orange-sienna, and the center is a yellow apricot shade that creates this unique illusion of electronic fakery, but no, it really is this gorgeous.  It will also kill bears and eat them."},
{"title": "PUnK sUcKKed", "date": "Tuesday, March 19, 2019", "text": "The only trend I was right there in the middle of during it's salad days was Punk.  There I was, a musician's girlfriend (not advised) and there was PUNK, and it was what was done if you wanted to be edge and gritty and get gigs.God I Hated It.Hated.  It.I've read stuff, I've listened to music, I've tried, but having been there at ground Zero while it was still pumping fluids the only thing I came away with was the absolute certainty that  Punk Was Horseshit.  A shuck. A bunch of moron kids watching a dirty addict pitch a full blown psychotic break to the sound of bad electronics and no talent, and pretending not to be freaked out.And let's look at that fashion trend a bit.  It took a hell of a lot of money to look that way.  Even a used Perfecto jacket was going for 200 bucks, and unless you did a lot of shoplifting all those chains, safety pins, handcuffs, Doc Martins and hair products cost cash dollars.  We'd be marching home from a gig, too poor and fucked up to own a car, and we'd pass groups of bright shiny punks with their edge hair and fingerless gloves and Donna Karan dresses worn over slashed long handle underwear and where would they trip on into?  The DISCOS.We did not see these people at our gigs, not for long. They walked in, established their cred, and off to wriggle to the BeeGees they went.  Our audiences were street kids and confused teenagers and Skinheads a-plenty.  Everyone hated to see them saunter into a venue.  They ruined everything. That's all they did.  They broke bottles and cut people, slam danced like maniacs, just random, idiotic agents of chaos that went from club to club fucking with people.  They weren't about anything, just like the punks I met and knew.We played with a few 'name' bands, as it turns out.  You wouldn't know it by me. The Rat$, The Wipers, Bad Brains, The Slits, the Screaming Sidewalks, Echo and the Bunnymen to name a few...and they weren't doing anything but cashing in on a trend.  I think it's the soullessness of Punk that repelled me as much as the sheer shittiness of the sound.  It was like a prolonged, unpleasant tantrum that everyone pretended to like.  Sitting in the green room with other bands, nobody was talking about anything but getting paid and getting laid.  They were a characterless group of folks who practiced their snarls in the mirrors and went from Kid You Went To High School With to Snarling Mayhem as soon as they plugged in the equipment.  Everyone was reading Interview With The Vampire and smoking dope.  It was gnawed trash, ragged, ugly, people sharing needles and shitting between parked cars and thousands of flyers so thick on the walls and phone poles that you could set them on fire, which broke up the monotony.I don't get the connection to Jamaican music either.  No two types of music could be more unalike.  While the Jamaicans had something to say in a manner that drew people in, Punk in America was pure First World Problem Whining that people felt obliged to like because it was being done in Europe.I don't look back on those days with any kind of fond nostalgia.  There it was, and I put up with it until I smartened up and stopped hanging around with musicians.  It would have been nice to say that there were moments, you know, those golden glimpses you have when you're part of Something That Matters, but the impression I've been left with was one of hopeless stupidity, desperate rage,  police cars, vomiting in alleys and chimps flinging shit.I loved the clothes, though."},

This is the summation of eleven years of my life, folks.  Take heed.I started working in motels and hotels back in the 1970’s.

And the kind of decor I had to put up with while doing so. It was bad. Really bad. Just like most of what you’re going to read.   Everyone in the 1970’s was doing the nasty just as much as they could with everyone in sight.  Aids was a distant rumor.  All venereal diseases could be cleared up with a shot of penicillin and a hearty handshake.  Motel rooms were primarily places where people went to “git down.” For an 18 - year - old - just out of the suburbs,  this amounted to the creepy sex version of a “Just throw ‘em into the water and let ‘em figure it out” swimming lesson.  My first week on the job I was finding cheap handcuffs, lengths of clothesline, wastebaskets filled with used condoms, beds like slaughterhouses, and manly substances squirted into all kinds of unlikely and rude places (like the telephone receiver, the air conditioner, and the bathroom heater, to name a few.)  And dildos. Lots and lots of dildos.  One was still buzzing.  Yes.  That’s how I found the thing.  They’d turned it on and stuffed it under the mattress to mess with me.  It worked.  And it stuck to the mattress, too.Bearing that in mind, yes, your room will be very clean more often than not, but it has been used by people before you.  If you find a bobby pin beneath a huge couch in a dark corner, stop and think how your housekeeper,  someone who works like a dog for minimum wage and has 17 similar rooms to clean every day, could have missed lifting up the sofa on her travels. If you find a severed finger, though?  You probably should inform the management about that. While it’s still fresh. Preferably.  Don’t wait until it looks like a pepperoni stick with a fingernail.  That’s icky.Most maids, however, are very diligent, and that’s because the learning curve is so steep.  A lot of people alone in a strange place with time on their hands become sick, sick animals who will take the cover off the overhead light fixture, crap in it and then replace the thing, just  for laughs.  You simply don’t go in expecting to find something like that until it happens.  You’ll get to clean it out and replace it, though.  That’s why Sartre said “Hell is other people”, and why “other people” are called “strangers.”  Strange doesn’t even begin.People will stick used baby diapers to the wall, like Hell’s butterfly collection. They will cover the windows with lipstick and use hamburgers as tub toys.  They will wipe unholy substances under the edges of things. They will paint the walls using squeeze packets of ketchup.  And they will flop bare ass anywhere there’s a surface that will hold them up, too, so while you’re writing that postcard to your Mom there at the desk, consider that fact.  Every horizontal element of that area has supported human junk in its native state.  The only areas that haven’t would be inside the drawers.  Why? Because that’s where you blow your nose.  Duh.  Those curtains have been used for more than blocking out the light, folks, and yes, we’re back to the subject of ass.  The carpet? Is vacuumed every day, yes, but is not shampooed after every customer.  Use common sense. Go in as you’d go into any other public situation, making reasonable allowances for minor failings, and have a clear idea of what’s appropriate.  Like what you should and should not lick, for example. Each other?  Go for it!  The phone?  No. The mirrors? No.  The headboard? No. Please no. I worked my way up the ladder over the course of eleven years, and what I found out is that the only difference between a penthouse suite and a no-tell motel is that you get a better class of creep in the former; and honestly, the  more expensive and exclusive the place, the less inclined the customers are to act like little ladies and gentlemen.  Other people have been cleaning their skid marks off the curtains for them all their lives.  You’re just another servant to them, and you’ll be treated as such.  In fact, you’ll be treated worse, because you have to stay there and work; they’ll be long gone down the road by the time you find that used tampon in the nightstand.  As a side note, a weird thing I’ve noticed over the years about your typical wealthy man is that they A. Powder their bathing suit regions profusely and then sit splat on the vinyl chairs, which leaves a distinct and unique print, B. Urinate in the garbage cans, and  C. Use the washcloths as toilet paper. This is true nine times out of ten.  No - well, not no shit, but, you know where I'm going with this.     There.  I’ve ripped on the customers.  Now I have to let down the side.  As the head of housekeeping I was often told to go through a customers belongings.  Sometimes the police will contact the manager and ask him to have a look through a given person’s room, which is illegal, and happens everywhere, and the manager sure in the hell isn’t going to do that.  You, the housekeeper.  You do that.  You check for guns and drugs and, say, stolen bicycles, bricks of coke, and stray underage girls, to give a few examples.  I tell you what, the first time I eased open a suitcase and found myself staring at five handguns and multiple boxes of ammo, I stopped a moment to squeeze back an immanent bout of explosive incontinence, and to wonder “are the tips really worth this?”  The fact is, you are the front line.  You as a housekeeper are the person who is closest to the customer, and if you’re 18 and need the job and your manager tells you to toss a room, you pull on your gloves, memorize the original position of every object and toss that room, every suitcase, every drawer, right down to the paint on the walls.  (Message to all the men out there who like to huff ladies panties out of a plastic bag:  You have more contemporaries than you think you do.)  But no matter where you stay, if you check in to hired lodgings frequently, your luggage will eventually be tossed just for shits and giggles, your clothing will be searched, your day planner read, your laptop trawled and the drawers of your room gone through.  Not every time you visit, and not by every maid, but it will happen. And we will take pictures of it on our phones and tell everyone what we found and laugh at you, too.  That’s the best case scenario. Theft happens. Please keep your valuables - including your recreational drugs - in the room or hotel safe, on your person, or just leave them at home.  If you take Schedule A prescription drugs for any condition and you leave those pill bottles out on the night table?  You’re going to come up a few missing.  Did you rent a room with a refrigerator?  Chances are that bottle of Wild Goose you put in there to chill will have a slug or two taken out of it.  And if you’re stupid enough to leave a bag of weed out in the open, you get what you deserve.  And here, finally, is the truly down and dirty.  If you stay in a room for an extended period of time, you are not allowed to hole up and stack up trash to the ceiling, nor are you allowed to sleep in the same nasty sheets and use the same stiff, funky disgusting towels for a month. You are not allowed to stick baby diapers all over the walls (see above) or use the kitchenette for making meth.  You are NOT ALLOWED TO BRING IN A ST. BERNARD AND NEVER TAKE IT OUT FOR A WALK. This is not your home.  It is a business.  That kind of thing causes destructive wear and tear on our facility, not to mention setting up a toxic situation for the housekeepers,  so forget your whining and complaining and marching out in a huff when management, or the head of housekeeping, tells you that we absolutely must go into you room every other day. Them’s the rules. It has to happen. If you are a long-term visitor and you treat the maids poorly we WILL get back at you in all kinds of nasty, sneaky, godless ways.  We know how.  We’ve learned from the best - our customers.  And you will not be able to prove a damn thing, because our job is cleaning up all traces of human occupation.  The ball is in our court, folks. Don’t forget it. Someone might unscrew the bottle of nasal spray you use and squirt a little spray cleaner in there.  Got open wine bottles?  Did you just shriek yourself crimson at the maid because she emptied your garbage cans before they were full?  Is your palate sophisticated enough to discern the soupcon of pee that was added to your Merlot?  I bet it isn’t. Staying in a hotel does not elevate you to Royal status.  Don’t shout at the help and wipe your boogers on the wall next to the bed like Henry the VIII.  (I’m making an assumption here, but I bet I’m not wrong.)  You are not King Henry the VIII.  You are someone who might get “kittied”.  That translates as “I wonder why my pillow smells like tuna?” We’re all working stiffs. You work for a living, so do I. The fact that I clean rooms does not make me a lesser life form, nor does it mean that my intimate personal favors come along with the price of the room.  Besides making up rooms, which means I deal with every bodily distillation imaginable, multiple times, every single day,  I also move furniture, run errands, hang curtains, schlep 50 lbs of sheets up and down three flights of stairs at a run, lend you an ear, find your baby’s lost binkie, clean ovens, set up cribs for your kids, and feed your pet.  All I ask is to be treated politely. So stay as long as you like. You don’t have to be chummy. Just be reasonable. Be polite. If your housekeeper does a good job, flip that person a few bucks (or more;  we’re open to large sums, particularly around the holidays.) Yes, this means you too, long term guest, and it means daily in your case.  A couple bucks every day will make your halo shine.  You give us that much,  and chances are good you won’t end up with, oh, say...water dipped out of your unflushed toilet mixed in your hair conditioner.  Or a suitcase full of tuna-shirts."},
{"title": "Hammer Time!!!", "date": "Thursday, September 13, 2018", "text": "This is a story ripped from the gritty front pages of 1989's most savage news!If you have allergies, then you need to check your tampon more often than you think.Now, don’t buy into the corporate bullshit.  You do not need five differently configured products.  You do not need to open up a goddamn map of Europe and plan your every movement for the next week using little colored flags and those pool cue things. Just carry extras, and duck into every bathroom you come across one, and check the fuse.Don’t wait until you sneeze.   I was picking my daughter up from grade school.  At the time I was driving a 1963 Ford Falcon, full trim package.  It was Energy blue, with patches of grey primer, and the word “WOW” spray-painted on the drivers side door.  Unmatched colorful chandelier crystals hung all around the edge of the headliner.  I was wearing Hammer pants that day.  Oh yes, I was;  and they were a bright red-cerise not found in nature and covered in minute, multicolored paisleys, because I didn’t stand out enough.  I looked AWESOME.  The school was a pleasantly landscaped facility surrounded by blossoming chestnut trees.  I stepped out of my car, took one breath and sneezed so hard my well-soaked tampon blasted down my pantleg like a bullet.I was not expecting this.  A glance down told me that the only tell-tale was a somewhat darker area down near my ankle, where the pants nipped in and clutched the lower leg. Remember those pants?  From the knee down they were skin tight.  But it had been one gut-busting hell of a sneeze.  The only thing keeping the little darling off the sidewalk was the tight ankle of the pant and the cuff of my sock.It was very warm.And I kept on sneezing as I stood there, per regulation, waiting for my little school girl to come out.  With all the other mommies and daddies.  Slowly soaking my vast, screaming red pants in explosive blasts with every sneeze.Not one single soul noticed. Once she hopped into the car I was gone. I ran stoplights.  I split lanes. I made illegal turns, passed cars, exceeded the speed limit and somehow, somehow, I was not stopped by the police, who would have been mightily impressed by my whole thing going on, I’m sure, particularly the 7 year old kid in back singing Madonnas “Like A Prayer”.I don’t even remember parking, just running to the shower.  Did I leave a trail?  Yes.  Yes, I did.And did the shower stall look like I’d slaughtered a pig in it ?  Oh my goodness yes.  And I kept sneezing. I’m rinsing and squeezing and rinsing my pants and socks and every time I thought I had things under control, I’d sneeze again, so I was holding them at chest height, which was awkward and unpleasant.Pants and socks rinsed,  I grabbed a roll of toilet paper to stem the tide and a bath sheet to wrap up in, dumped my clothes in the washer, got that under way and then duck-walked, dripping wet and barefoot, wrapped in a huge towel, 409 in hand,  back through the house, pushing a dishrag with one foot, mopping up the scene of the crime.All the way out to the car. Every time I sneezed, I could feel the toilet roll hanging on for dear life. I kept it in place by invoking the kind of sheer emergency telekinetic power that mothers manifest when lifting a freight car off an infant.The only lasting answer was a drastic measure.  And so once I was finished mopping up what looked like an axe murder, I rolled up a bath towel, saddled up, then pulled a pair of my husbands underwear over the works, and threw a big old hippie dress on top of it all.Wherever you are, in whatever you do, God bless you, M.C. Hammer."},
{"title": "Wombat Facts You Should Know", "date": "Tuesday, September 11, 2018", "text": "There are many facts about the wombat. You should know these facts so that if you ever meet up with one in a dark bar you will be able to make intelligent conversation. Many of them are quite reserved at first, but once the ice is broken they make universally sought after partners in dance competitions (See Marquese Scott, Alfonso Ribiero, Soulja Boy) So sit back and enjoy this excursion into the wom-world!1. Wombats will lie to you.They will totally lie to you if they feel like you're an anthropologist or you have a cultural superiority-type attitude.  You have to go in pure of heart.  Many of the interviews that have been published in the past are full of wombat \"in\" jokes, or are pure fabrication on the part of the interviewee.2. Most wombats like to live in holes.Wombat holes vary in quality.  This is the reason that wombats have evolved a keratin helmet thing over their whole entire ass because it makes it so they can use their ass as an armored hole door.  Yes!3.  Wombats have pride.They turn their backs on their enemies.  Hence the helmet ass.  That's pretty hardcore.  Do not take a stick and rap on the wom-butt once he's down there guarding his wom-burrow, though.  It is in poor taste.4. Wombats do not care.If you have a problem, do not take it to a wombat.  Wombats have busy lives.  They do wombat things.  Your dumbass problems mean nothing to them, unless your problems are connected to an issue related to wombat preferences, activities, or lifestyles.5. Some wombats are famous.Liv Tyler is a wombat who had earned great international acclaim for her work both on and off the screen.   Ed Sheeran, pop artist, donates half his annual earnings to Wombat charities.  Kim Jong-il has dodged direct statements concerning his rumored wombat heritage, but candid photographs reveal that the tell-tale helmet butt formation is present.  Famous wombats in history include Pico Della Mirandola, Herbert Hoover, William Howard Taft and the reknowned American E-Sports Faze Clan members   FaZe Housecat (now renamed as Timid)  FaZe ClipZ and FaZe Resistance.6.Wombats accidentally landed a plane in Israel in the early 1960s.  The matter gave rise to numerous conspiracy theories.7.  A favorite vacation destination of wombats is Dubai, where some have elected to take up residence as replacements for the children traditionally used as jockeys in camel racing.8.   Wombats.9.  Wombats pass cube-shaped poos.  Great care is taken by Australians in the know not to mistake this substance for spilled bouillion cubes, although each year some 300-400 cases of square wombat poo ingestion are treated in hospitals.  The victims are usually elderly vegetarians.9. Wombats are marsupials with a difference - an upside-down pouch!  As they spend the majority of their time on all fours this presents little difficulty for the young, and serves to prevent the pouch from being filled with lsd, opals, syringes, coal, peyote buttons and other elements found in the rugged Outback soil.  Wombat young complain most commonly about the \"Dutch Oven\" effect on their early childhood.10. Wombats will whip up on you.  Broken legs and puncture wounds are most commonly reported by people hapless enough to disturb the \"wisdom\" or group of wombats during their nocturnal rituals.  No deaths have been reported, giving rise to numerous conspiracy theories.11.  While the name \"Wombat\" would seem to refer to the animals relation to bats, the binomial name of at least one variant, Vombatus ursinus, translates roughly into \"Wombatbear\".  This terrifying interation of the species is thought to be extinct, although Amelia Earhart described a \"heavy, digging animal with a motorized saw\" in her last transmissions.  Most scientists dismiss her words as a psychological manifestation of altitude sickness, although her fractured account of \"broad bat wings, huge things with horrible, pulsing, venous structures easily discerned due to the transparent nature of the encompassing tissue\" and a \"little head facing out its bottom, signalling as though in distress\" is eagerly grasped by cryptozoologists as evidence that could point to the cause of her disappearance.12. Many wombats are incapable of driving a car, flying a plane or operating a cuisinart successfully. Scientists attribute this to their widespread abuse of salvia divinorum, bath salts and detergent pods."},
{"title": "Aretha Franklin", "date": "Monday, August 20, 2018", "text": "I have always needed music.  It's the way I'm wired.  I can put up with a lot of grief and trouble, but if I don't have good music I can go to, things will get bad.It's the usual bullshit...depression, ADHD, PTSD, a whole bunch of other things that come and go like special features.I genuinely do want to live more than I want to die.  Sometimes, though, no reason, despair just sinks its claws into my head.  But if I can get to my music and play something, it'll give me a few moments of being out of myself and away from the shit.  I don't know why.  I can honestly say that I owe my life to certain songs. But this isn't about that.  This is about love.  This is about what another person would call grace, or spirit.  This is about Aretha FranklinWhen I was seven years old I was shopping with my mother in a temporary Mexican imports store on 2nd Avenue, downtown Portland Oregon, the first time I ever heard 'Respect' sung by Aretha Franklin.At that age I was a true blue Beatles fan, with Jethro Tull just over the horizon.  Just a little kid.  I never went though an Osmonds phase, or a David Cassidy stage, although I enjoyed a few years' happy relationship with the works of Messrs. Taupin and Dwight around puberty, for which I can be reasonably forgiven.I remember standing there in the middle of the store, among the sheet plywood tables covered with pottery and lamps and dolls and ollas.  Large and open, the room was high ceilinged  to draw up the heat, so near the Willamette river that there was bar of granite across the threshold that you stepped up and then over and down into the store, being too close to the river not to use a precaution like that to block the floodwater in a town that posted the high water marks in bronze on the buildings.The old transom-style row windows were open, lined overhead atop the storefront glass, and they let out the stale heat while the open doorway let in the deeply river rank, river-scented air, and the two front doors were held open with  cinder blocks.My mother went methodically up and down the rows at a slow measured stroll, shopping and weighing and occasionally examining without breaking the saunter.  Somewhere in Heaven yet she is not paying retail, but taking a mental balance of the items on offer and placing them in strict order linked by a whole web of subsets, blissful and acquisitive.Me, I was listening to the music. Uninterested in the objects, wandering.It was the station that only reached as far as the rough  boundaries of the city of Roses, at an obscure place on the radio dial.  I don't remember the call numbers.  I do remember that the station always put out music that grabbed my ear.  You never heard it anywhere else, the really good music like this.  The station played all the music that was out there and new.  It was the only one that did, and that was a damned shame.   Us out in the woods only heard Casey Kasems' Top 40 Hits once a week.  Our only contemporary station was KISN.  \"97.1 Good Guy Territory On Your Dial!\"   Beatles and Beach Boys?  Sure. Blue Cheer? Humble Pie?Listen.  Far away.  You can hear the crickets chirp.But wait.  I am standing here and I am seven, listening to this music for the first time. Stock still.I already liked the swoops and leaps of the gospel convention, all the improvised runs of inserted notes between the spaces of the melody, with the instruments, and the time signatures that were divided into precise fractions, but free like wings, that voice singing.The radio station was playing. I drifted away.This woman singing had a different voice than the other gospel singers I'd heard late or early on Sunday  t.v.  Their voices were rich and heartfelt, full of style and ornament and velvet, but they were singing about.Not because.What I was hearing in this moment was a declaration, not a story.This was an adult woman, singing as an adult woman about being an adult woman.The little Catholic girl stopped short.  I'm laughing thinking about that moment.I recognized her voice; she'd already been on television.  I'd probably even heard the song before.  But minus distractions, I was hearing Aretha Franklin.  Full on.   And telling you. I knew it was like gospel, but with a wake-up slank beat walking toward you like a gunfighter. This stuff I was hearing now talked with the woman in me.The song Ms. Franklin was singing was \"Respect\".I starving needed this song like food in me.That summer day all the stores near the waterfront had their doors open, the old glass storefronts, survivors of the earliest days, shining tall fronts made of sheet rolled glass and still intact, filling all the muntins, facing east and turning the interiors into ovens as the sun passed just above the buildings of the further side.  Rents were low on a east-facing storefront in Oregon.I meandered up near the wide open doors.  It was one of those old fashioned inset doorways, so you could get a front and a side view of the items  being displayed before you entered, which I thought was kind of touching, like asking 'Are you sure? Take another look, now...' and then you might or might not put your hand on the door handle, cast in bronze or brass acanthus or kilned porcelain stamped with advertising.I stepped juuuuust a bit outside.All the stores were playing the same station and all the doors and windows were open.Her voice was there.  All up and down 2nd Street nearly bare of other people because of the sun and the light, the same song was inside and outside on the still August air, in the humidity, one solid sound from College Hill, down along past the river and on through the wrecking yards and factories off Nickerson Avenue, going north.Aretha was singing \"Respect\".  I glanced back at my mother - she was oblivious - and then looked right back away.  Ignore the kid, mom, keep shopping.But I was blushing! I was blushing!  I had boy cousins!  And there were boys in the neighborhood, and I went to school in the blue collar/logger/stock car suburbs and I knew what this lady was singing about, and I'd never heard any one, any woman, say or think or -  hell no! - sing words like this!I could not believe this was even on the radio! How on earth did this go out over those airways back then?And it was catchy, and happy, and it had a laughing kind of confrontation in the tone like a protest song.  But not a grim shrill one.  It was a statement. Who I am, what I want, and what I expect.And this woman wanted to be done right by.At seven I already had a feel for the language and the ways it was used. I'd been reading fluently for three years.  I was fascinated by the many different meanings of one word, and I was already good friends with the Websters' Dictionary,  and how words could disguise meanings, and how lies could mean truth, and humor disguise rage, and aphorisms made of acceptable words display their rebel meaning right out in the open, flying like a huge flag, but in a way that the timid could hide behind.Back in 1967, not very many people in Portland, Oregon, were going to admit to being anything but agreeable. But that was the same year back in Portland that all that bullshit  began to change for good, in flames.I got all the 'code' and the euphemisms.  I mean please, let's be obvious.  Nothing in her tone said anything but what I heard.  She was using tried and true allusions I'd already heard in rock music and blues and even country music.  And oh, her amazing, laughing attitude was stripping away all doubt.It was so excellent.  It was so cool!  I had to hide my reaction to it, though, and the fact that I was listening.I mentioned earlier here that I'd seen her on the television.  I knew she was a pretty lady with big wigs and false eyelashes and sheath dresses with sequins who sang as a one-act on the variety shows my parents liked.  She was always dressed like a formal lady, with high heels and her hair and makeup done up to go to a party, like that, and she looked like all the moms I knew in their clothes style from the last decade there.But that voice.And those words.And what she said.There was no way I was going to glance at the owner and his buddy, way over at the cash register. I didn't want them to see me know what this song was about.I know.  Here I'm telling you about my feelings and all the things I saw and felt and the sounds,  that all happened in the space of a 2:29 time frame back in 1967.I stepped out just past the entry alcove and onto the sidewalk.  I  heard her voice all around me, that beautiful soaring swallows' dive and glide of notes around the melody, all that huge beautifulness filling the street on a hot afternoon in August, down near the river.  I could smell the hot pavement and the dank exhalations from the iron grids that vented the secret underground part of 2nd Avenue, the humidity like a full elevator, and Aretha Franklin was telling you that she would have respect.She was telling a man what was going to happen.   When, how,  and what she meant when she said \"respect\".  Try me and you'll find out in no uncertain terms what 'Respect' means to me. Oh, it meant respect. But it was a word with lots of meanings;  not the kind of talk that nice people admitted they understood, and ever since,  people tried to keep that smashed in a box labelled 'Feminist Anthem' and 'Civil Rights'.Oh yes indeed, it meant those things too, but it meant more. It stood on top of that stuff and stated the facts of the matter.She tore open the skies, so unimaginably regal that nobody could see her or understand that she wasn't asking for a damn thing.She was stating her due.I didn't have any idea what I was hearing was called Soul.Aretha Franklin told me what a grown woman was about.I am not normal.  People don't like that. They sure in hell didn't like the way I did it or the fact that I was so little and little children are not mentally ill, they're being bad. It was like that in 1967.You can be killed by an attitude.  You can be killed by an opinion.When you were young and mentally ill and sickly with asthma like I was, well, your death is expected, or it was in those days, and I wasn't supposed to know that all the adult people around me were waiting for me to choke out while they denied to my face that anything was wrong with me but being spoiled and pretending to be sick.  I knew words and I could hear lies.  I learned real young who was afraid I was going to die, and who wanted me to get it over with so they could have their lives back.But me.  I had this one strong, strong retort planted in me in 1967, on an afternoon with my mother, killing time until our bus came, wasting these two guys' time in this case-lot temporary store.Aretha Franklin, I thought.  I wondered why is only this one lady singing like this?It made me look for the answer.  I wanted to know the answer to this question, because it was so stark, you see?  That song was so in opposition to something that I didn't realize needed to be opposed until that nascent epiphany, out listening to her sing in the empty street and out up past the buildings in the sky.  I, said this song,  have a human life, and I am going to live a whole human life in full voice and ignore your approval  because I don't need it.That couple of minutes and a few seconds changed me. The very first time that ever happened.  I didn't know how to contain it and I was quiet for hours afterward.   But I was pointed in the right direction. I looked for more music like that, and I had to stay up until 2:am to hear it, when the other stations went off the air.Time went by and I started in and did what I wanted, what I was not supposed to do or be, and I drowned out your neglect and and dislike and antipathy and approval with my interests and the things I chose to read and hear and say that made me feel valuable and important and smart.  I was a hitch in your plan, I was a barrier to your will, I was a thorn in your side;  and you won't make me die  even though you will refuse to take me to the doctors and you will call me a stark liar despite the obvious, and I'll not only live, I'll make you feed me and house me and educate me and clothe me for the next eleven motherfucking years and you'll take it and like it or not, but you goddamn well will do it.So many things are out there that can get inside you, overwhelming things that can turn you, words and sights that make you into different shapes when you are a little kid.  The whole world is vivid almost to the point of terror.  Often to the point of terror if I'm going to tell you the truth about my life, because of the way I am and the way I was. I had no way of not being influenced by something that strong.  It was the first time I'd ever heard a woman singing being an adult, and this was Aretha, and Aretha was an empress.  I had never, ever heard anything like this song, this woman, that way of thinking about yourself and being a woman.There are not enough wonderful things I can offer you or try to say about you in a way that will look and read as magnificently and as miraculously and as deeply as the impression that your song and your voice had on me in that short time.  I am not anywhere near up to that task. I said this, though, and it's true.I love you, Aretha."},

I've tried it!  Cats dug!  They shit!  They laid down and had a snooze all up in the chili pepper I spent 7 bucks on!   Cats don't care, people!  You ever seen a cat lick it's own ass?  They don't care!Number TWO:  capscasin oil and chili powder does not do a damn thing but lie there and be expensive and useless in the temperate zone garden (LOOK IT UP LUIGI.)  It doesn't repel pests and it doesn't kill anything.  It just costs you money.HOWEVER:  Now if you live in Chili territory - USDA zones 8, 9 , 10 and Hell,  ground chili and capscasin could very well wipe out every pest it touches.  In that climate, on the pests adapted to those conditions?  Sure. I can see how that would make sense.  I don't know if it does.  The only thing I do know is that here in the PNW, it just doesn't work.  At all.Number THREE:  Juices of garlic, onions, tomato leaves, that shit simply does nothing whatsoever.  It doesn't kill pests and doesn't repel deer, dogs, cats, Batman or armadillos.  Similarly eggshells (WTF?), Irish Spring soap and things like 'Deer B Gone'?   They don't work.Number FOUR:  Deer proofing:  THERE IS NO SUCH THING.Like Purgatory and the Cottingly Fairies, kids, it's all crap.  There is no deer-proof plant.  Or scent. Anywhere in the world.  Fawns and milking does do the majority of the damage in the springtime  - does, because they are desperate to make milk, and fawns, because they have to learn this shit for themselves.  They'll chew a plant down to the ground before they realize they hate the way  it tastes.Now, deer wandering around at large among human habitations at night?   Those adorable Bambi critters that look so pretty and graceful? And chew up your garden (How to tell?  The leaves will look like they've been cut with pinking shears.)   Your visiting deer are smelling Buck B Bad and Doe B Ready.  Those deer have other things on their minds. They're going to do the deed in your back yard, at night, and if they want a snack they'll take a bite or six of whatever's on hand.THE ONLY SURE METHOD OF KEEPING DEER AND OTHER ANIMALS OUT OF YOUR GARDEN - A FENCE, AND A LOUD, EXCITABLE AND BELLIGERENT DOG THAT HAS ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS AT ALL HOURS.I am not here to lie to you.  I am here to dispel the bullshit.  If you have a belligerent Basset Hound, excellent.  If you have a Bernese Mountain Dog or an Irish Wolf Hound? You may also potentially have venison for dinner.  No shit.  Any dog that is super territorial and alpha will keep ruminants and other animals out of your garden, or at least take them on so they'll remember.  Even a chihuahua - those little shits will flat whip up on anything.  They don't care.  They're the hummingbirds of the dog world.  Too quick to catch, too mean to avoid!  Dogs are flat out awesome that way.  They work in every environment on every intruder.  Unless they hate you.Number FIVE:  Now that having been said, I have heard reliable reports that concentrated scents -  Cougar, Coyote, Lynx, Wolf or Bear - will chase cats, dogs, various other critters, and deer.  You can buy it in any sporting good store.  And Wal Mart. And grocery stores.  In fact it's a little odd how easily you can come by Piss of Random Animal.  Some of the urines on offer will freak you out.  Turkey?  Raptor? Gator?  How in the name of Eleanor Roosevelt Winfrey do they collect that?You're going to go through a few bottles of the stuff.  You put it on little pieces of fabric that you tie to a good 2 ft.tall stick and let flutter so that the wind blows it around.  You have to use a lot of these stick-and-fabric odor flags all over your property, and you have to keep renewing it from it's little squeeze bottle.  This does work, but be more aggressive with it than other sources might suggest.If you live in suburban Los Angeles, go ahead.  Use actual 'Shits-in-the-woods' Bear whiz.  Any large, predator whiz.   No worries. If you live in a rural area, I'd think twice.  Nothing will ruin your day like a facefull of cougar when you totter out to get your newspaper in the morning.  Not to mention a wolf.  Wolves bring their friends to share in the fun.  That scenario will not end up pretty.  Coyote ditto.I have heard that Zoo Doo, in particular Lion shit, will chase anything out there.  I tend to believe this.  You'll pay a premium for this if your local zoo even sells it., and you'll have to turn it into a slurry to activate it's stinky spell, but when your neighborhood tom cat catches scent of that action it will leave town.  I've seen dogs react to it like they were having a sudden seizure - leap twisting into the air and hit the ground running, straight out away.  It's kind of impressive.  Portland, Oregon rose gardeners swear by it.  It's used with abandon in the Portland Rose Test Gardens, in fact.  I've been there.  You don't smell lion pee.  You smell Heaven.  And all the plants are pristine, even though the Rose Test Gardens are way up near Forest Park, which is 5200 acres of WILD FUCKING WOODLAND IN THE MIDDLE OF DOWNTOWN PORTLAND. This isn't no managed bullshit like Central Park in New York.  This is wild-ass forest with a full foresty compliment of forest creatures, including woods-dwelling winos.  Black Bears live there, and they go down into town to raid dumpsters and eat homeless people down by the river. Portland has a resident downtown population of deer up into the hundreds.  No shit.  I lived there for 20 years.  I seen 'em.  I seen 'em walking straight down the goddamn middle of West Burnside, sniffing around for dumpsters and bedding plants.  It's a strange and beautiful sight at 3 in the morning, in the fog.  People will run out of their apartments or businesses and chase the deer out of the street so they don't get run over, so instead the deer wander into the residential side streets. Portland is basically the coolest town on the planet.You have to remember, though, that animals have memories.  Eventually they'll realize that what they're smelling isn't living in the neighborhood, because they haven't smelled any kill sites.  Your pesty four-legged neighbors will eventually come back.  If your problem with dogs and cats is that bad, it's time to start live-trapping Fluffy or Fido and delivering them to their homes (or to the shelter.)  Drive them home, and knock on the door and hand the owner their animal and explain kindly and gently that their beloved pet is ruining your garden.  I have actually done this.  It works really well.  I only had one problem with a return dog, so I washed him really thoroughly and gave him a flea bath and brushed him out and got him all nice and clean and lovely, and then returned him home, which creeped out his owners so bad that they kept him in their yard from that moment on.Ya do what you gotta do.Number SIX:  If you live in an area where four-legged predators are common, don't use urines specific to your location because it will ATTRACT them.  Nobody wants a  goddamn bear in their back yard (Ursid, not hominid.) OK.  Bear whiz will chase lesser predators.  But it will attract OTHER BEARS.  You see what I'm getting at with this?  In my rural area, I would NOT use Bear whiz because Black Bear visit frequently and I don't want them at my door pretending to sell Girl Scout Cookies.  I would choose something exotic, and evil, and unknown.  If I could get Tyrannosaurus Piss, I'd go with that.  But sadly, I cannot obtain such an elixir.  Harry Potter could, but me, no. You know what works?  Butch Husband Piss.  Man, this stuff is so good it chases the JW's.  Dogs?  Get your Butch Biker Husband to piss waaaay up high on a nearby telephone pole, or tree.  Just soak it down.  Your problems are finished.  This is all due to something called pheromones.  This is an ingredient in male pee that says I WILL KILL YOUR ASS AND EAT YOUR YOUNG AND CLAIM YOUR MATE AS MY OWN.  The higher up it's applied, the bigger the inquisitive noses will assume the Butch Biker to be. Gone baby gone.I am dead serious.  Human male pheromones are the bomb.  Your petunias are safe. If you do not have a Butch Biker Husband,  flag a passing biker down and explain your issue.  Buy him a six.  He'll be happy to oblige all your urine needs.I have tried my own brand.  It doesn't seem to work.  Now, at a 1: 5 dilution at the root of your roses, you will have roses on roses on roses, happy, smiling, friendly, spotless and beautiful roses.  But human bitch piss doesn't seem to chase anything away, no matter how angry you are at the time of urination.  It's just the way it is.Your little garden is doing wonderfully and you are so proud!  You are enjoying how these little lives interact with all the other elements of nature and give back beauty and interest, and oxygen too.  You are trippin' on how life really is a circle, and how utterly Zen a plant is, how in tune with it's surroundings, how in harmony with all of nature.  Small miracles, simple, elemental lives, giving and dying.You're getting way into this.And then it happens -  the neighbor, his dog, or his cat takes a piss - or a shit, (your neighbors might be weirder than you realize) - on your plants.If piss or shit happens, as soon as you realize it, rinse it off with the hose, and no worries.  Your plants will appreciate the extra nitrogen and other elements contained in the dissolved pee and shit, but  ass products just left to lay on the leaves will burn them, because ass products are made to stick like a syrup, and plants don't like that.  Their leaves and other structures have little pores called stomata, which absorb water and air and nutrients, and straight up butt products act like an overdose, clog those pores, and will 'burn' the plant. This will appear as dead brown places on plants, or just plain deadass plants.  Large dogs and cats and human males have evil Satanic piss that will kill anything it touches.  So check your little garden every day, and if you smell or see evidence of a rude visitor, a rinse with the garden hose is all you need to fix this issue.  And maybe a change of friends.This  having been mentioned, one of the best 'foods' for a hosta?  Is human puke. It's moderately acid and contains broken down carbon.  I am not lying, I am not saying this as a joke.  It works.Don't ask me how I know this.  I just do.If you have a party, find the guy that always pukes and party him out.  Then lead him over to your Hosta bed and let him cut loose.  Be kind.  Prop 'em up.  Hold his/her hair.  Lead them away when they are finished and let them plop on the lawn or in their car with their heads turned sideways.  Life is a cycle.  Imagine Keith Richards if nobody had seen fit to monitor his movements early on.  He'da joined the 27 club. Be mindful.  Your friend has just given you, and your hostas,  the gift of regurgitation.  Water it in  using the hose.  That's a cosmic debt you owe, my friend.________________________________________________________Here is a good, simple, organic way to keep dogs and human males from pissing on your plants:Find a big rock.  Or take a big piece of irregular wood, or something interesting.  Put this object in front of the plants, or to one side.   The bolder and bigger this object is the better. I do not mean a wrecked car or an abandoned motor home, but like a big damn rock, OK?  A big funky piece of wood you found.  An old rototiller or a milk can? - that size.Dogs always go for what they can piss high on.  They'll aim for the tall rock or old  milk can or what have you.Human males, like dogs, always have to piss on something for whatever reason.  Pissing on your giant rusty anchor or big lump of rose quartz will tickle their fancy no end.  It's a true fact and it works.  Make sure to rinse this object occasionally, and your plants will thank you.  I'm not fucking with you.  This is the shit and it works like a charm. If your problem is with a human female squatting in your little garden plot to pass whatever falls out her hine, you are way into Oh My God Fucked Upville.  Call the police.  Get out your phone and take a movie so you can show it to the police when they get there so they won't think you're nuts. Or nail her with a bb gun.  No I am not kidding. I've had a straaaaaaaaaange life, kids.______________________________________________Anyway, lets say your neighborhood is free of women who piss and shit on plants,  and problem dogs and cats and men.Now look at what you have helped to create!  You have grown your first little garden bed and it looks great!  You even have an upright object of interest to one side, and all  your friends will say \"That's really nice!\"  And it will be nice!  You will take care of a small area that will teach you about what happens to plants and how they grow and the effects of the weather, insects, and other wildlife on them.Now live with this for a year.  Watch what happens to the plants.  How they grow.  How the blossoms wither.  How new ones form, and where.  Watch how leaves form and what eats them - because they will get chewed on.  A few holes is fine.  A whole section ate down to the stem, though,  is the work of snails or slugs, or even rabbits or baby iguanas if you live in Florida! In the morning, glance over your little plant bed. Look around the base of your plants and quick just lift up and look underneath the leaves.  If you find slugs or any of the aforementioned, huck them into the street or into your neighbors yard.  Search for little white, pearly looking clusters of balls the size of beads, usually under rocks or pieces of rotted wood.  These are slug/snail eggs.  SMASH THEM MERCILESSLY.If you find little tiny grey slugs that look kind of boogery, these are not baby slugs.  Don't cry for them, Argentina.  These are a separate breed of slug that loooooove eating pathways in leaves - particularly iris leaves - and will turn them from lovely blue-green fan-blades of structure and color into  freaky alien shapes, and kill them. The rule of thumb is:  If you find a slug or a snail, no matter how cute it is, kill it or throw it into your neighbors yard, and smash the eggs.Slugs are long gross spotty or orangey brown wrinkly things, like alien scrotums with antennae.  Here in the PNW we also have a variety called the Banana Slug, which is as big as a bananna, is yellow with irregular black and brown spots, and altogether looks like a goddamn ambulatory rotten banana.  With antennaeHow to take care of slugs?  Take a pair of garden shears, or dedicated Slug Scissors,  and cut them in twain.  Snap.  Ooooog.  Instant death.  Then toe them out into the yard, because...GROSS GARDENING FACT! Live slugs will mate with dead slugs, successfully, because dead slugs don't know they're dead. Slugs are hermaphroditic.  Until they dry out, those parts still work.  I've cut a slug in two, and seen the head half eating a leaf while it's nether part lay several feet away.How to tell the difference between a slug and a snail:Snails have a shell on top and an oogy part out front, with antennae, and another, out back, with a butthole.  Their shell is rather a pretty, round, yellow and brown striped shell.Ignore the glamour.  Here in the 4th Corner they will TAKE OVER FAST.  You take these little fuckers and huck them right out into the street. Stomp them if you can make yourself.  Smash them with a rock. Or if you're the merciful type, give every single one a flying lesson.   Or, if you're super murderous, drop them into a gallon bottle with about a 1/4 cut of bleach in  it.  Drop the snail or slug in, fasten the lid, and shake it around every so often.  When it gets too thick to shake, dump it in the road or in the middle of the driveway, anyplace that the bleach won't cause issues.  If you have a neighbor you don't like, a nocturnal baptism of their front stoop will provide a satisfying sense of justice having been done.Slugs are gross.  Snails are a plague. They reproduce like a motherfucker and eat anything that won't eat them.__________________________________DESTRUCTION OF THE GARDEN BED.If you come out one morning and your plants are all dug up and thrown all over the place, you have four suspects, in order of likelihood -1. Cats.  Cats love nice loose soil in garden beds.  They'd rather shit there than in a box, and they get all exuberant and roll around and dig and kick and shit and generally make a  big deal out of it.Solution to cats:   not for the PETA members of my audience - turn away, faint hearts.My mother used to keep a slingshot and a can of small round rocks next to the door.  If she saw a cat in the garden, she'd nail it, or get close enough to it that it that the cat would freak out and run.  Don't be sick and aim for their heads; just be disciplinarian. Got a persistent kitty?  Aim for it's side.  This does not kill the cat, but it does make it freak out.  My mom got to be a crack shot.  So accurate, in fact, that as  soon as that cat provided her with a.... *ahem*... target -  zang!   She'd laugh until tears ran down her face.  She was kind of a bitch.  But tell  you what; we would never see that cat again.  Hello Kitty?  Say Goodbye, Kitty, ya nasty little fuck.  Go shit in your own yard.Suspect 2.  DogsA photoelectrically activated sprinkler system with a sudden blare of light will send those hounds running.Similarly  Humans.  For whatever reason.  A sudden blast of cold water will send them coursing away into the night.Suspect 3. Moles, Voles, RatsSnap traps baited with peanut butter and bacon grease all mushed together into the little bait platen.\"Body of Christ?\"'AAAckGAKGKGAK ARGJHAAAAaaaaaaaaaaa.'\"Pax vobiscum.\"Suspect 4:  People.People will do all kinds of dumbass stuff.  Digging up your garden and flinging it all over the place is just one stitch in the crazy quilt.  With humans, you need a light activated monitor and a freaky siren.  I mean seriously.  If some nutty fucker is scrabbling around flinging your Wave Petunias or your German Iris, they need a dose of psychological hindbrain terror to deter them.  Lights, sound, Gary Numan, all in a sudden burst will send them dashing out into the nearest freeway. \"BBBrrrrrrmmmmmmmSMACK!budump, budump, badump, dump, dump, sklishhhhhh._________________________________________Neem oilThis is the biggest boondoggle since Violet Wave Therapy.  Neem oil has no hidden miracle properties.  It works, yes, but only because IT IS AN OIL.  You can take food grade vegetable oil - the kind you cook with! - and it will do the same job cheaper and less stinkier than Neem will.  Pisses me off.  Fuckin' neem oil.Safer SoapThe active ingredients in this are fat-based soap and rotenone.  The soap sticks it on.  The rotenone does the killing.  Is this worth 12.00 dollars a bottle?  No it is motherfucking not.  You can make your own bug killah and it will work better.  This is a home remedy that actually works, and my grandmother showed me how to make it, and it you want to dispute it then you take it up with her, and she will give you a crack across the shins with her cane because she took no shit alive and probably doesn't dead, either.Go to the large department store.  They will have a product in the skin care/soap aisle called Pure Castille Soap. Grate, or chunk up half a bar of Castille soap into a half gallon of water and simmer it, while stirring occasionally.  Get all the soap pieces melted.Castille Soap is weird stuff.  Sometimes this will set up like a gelatin.  Sometimes it will stay liquid.  It is a mystery.  But what you do, is you put it in a spray bottle (dilute it with water if you have go so it will be sprayable) and start hitting those aphids and japanese beetles and what have you like the raging fist of Thor.  Just this soap solution sprayed on the aphids will kill their aphidy asses dead. In difficult spots, just put on a glove and hold the afflicted plant part steady while you spray it, and the aphids will just drop off it.  Castille soap makes a waxy coating that suffocates the bugs, and doesn't hurt anything else.  At all.  Another bug could come along and eat that dead aphid and it would be fine.  Castille Soap is the shiznit of all home gardening remedies.  It works, and it's cheaper than shit!  I also have used Neutrogena to the same effect, but Neutrogena costs 5 bucks a bar and you can get ten bars of Castille for five bucks here - you do the math.  I was an English major.People that say 'Oh, I just take the hose and blow all those aphids all off' are doofuses. Those things will return.  And you've just blown them all over your other plants, too, so you've made the situation worse!  And now that you've overwatered your plant, it will put out more soft tissue for the aphids to vampirize, and they will enthusiasticallly return in layers of 3.  Yes. ACTUAL LAYERS OF THREE APHIDS SUCKING THE LIFE OUT OF YOUR PLANTS.Don't do this.Some aphids fly. Some are placed by ants (look it up.  It's interesting.) Either one will succumb to Castille soap, and the ants will get discouraged and leave, because of the waxy feel on their little anty feet.______________________________________________________Another home remedy that works vs. another one that doesn't.  Early in the spring, take a half a teaspoon of some wettable sulphur, dilute it in water according to the directions, put it in a spray bottle and top it up with a little Castille soap mix.  Take and hit the lower stems, old cut surfaces and bud unions of your roses with this, and also the lower stems of your clematis.  First, though, rake out all the dead leaves and shit from under these plants and hit the surface of the soil all around the drip line, too.  Yes.  This will go a long way in preventing your roses from getting fungus diseases and preventing Clematis Wilt.  I've done it, it works.  Like magic.  LIKE MAGIC.You can buy any number of antifungal products and drenches and what have you, and spend a good chunk of change on them too, and they may or may not work, or work about half-ass.  This simple mixture works 99% of the time.  Your roses will come up mostly clean,- which is the best you can expect from any rose, no matter how pampered, so don't buy in to the bullshit -  and your clematis will flourish.________________________________________________________Plain vegetable oilFood grade vegetable oil, applied with a brush to the trunk and lower limbs of a tree in March on a dry day will prevent that tree from getting black mildew and scale insects.  And probably other things  too, but that's what I was dealing with.  Works like a charm.  It can also be applied directly to the scale insect,which smothers the little bastard and kills it.  Ha.Tent CaterpillarsLook these up. They're creepy as hell. If you have these things, which are spread by scroungy birds feet, be a good neighbor and cut them out of your tree as soon as you spot them.  They spread like wildfire and will kill a healthy tree in one season. They will come back too, so keep checking the canopies of your broad leaved trees.  After you cut their nests down, either smash the nests or set them on fire. My dad was of the fire persuasion.Tent caterpillers smell disturbingly like french fries as they cook and make a squeaking sound as well. Their brethren will book ass as fast as their little caterpillar legs will take them from the burn site, which one would expect, so our jobs as kids was to stomp all the escapees.Good times, folks.  Good times.______________________________________________________________And now comes the ultimate in home remedies, home made, 100% organic, good for the environment, and will stop - not kill, but stop - powdery mildew in it's tracks; as well as serve as a foliar or root-zone fertilizer. What is this miracle substance?  What is this secret of the ages?Diluted Human Urine.I use it in a watering can with a rose sprinkler at a dilution of one part whiz to 5-7 parts water. The older the whiz is, the better. No I don't know why.   As soon as you see powdery mildew, which will look like little dots of white on the leaves of a plant, sprinkle this mixture on it and it will stop it dead in it's tracks, and the plant will be able to continue to photosynthesize, plus get a little fertilizer in the bargain.This is what you need to be using to water your seedlings with.  No more mildew, no more stem rot. Happy, happy seedlings.This is a miracle on roses.  An absolute miracle.It is also good on perennial asters and Bergamot.  Bergamot with a beginning case of powdery mildew responds like Venus Arising From The Sea in response to a comprehensive sprinkling of diluted human pee, which sounds so dirty, right? But it absolutely arrests the development of the mildew.Honeysuckle will bless  you.Tomato leaves, curcurbit leaves - boom, fungus stopped.  The leaf won't look any prettier, and will eventually yellow and get crackly, but until then it will still have functioning surfaces that will work for the good of the organism.  It is somewhat less effective on clematis, although it definitely slows the progress of powdery mildew.In the hot, windless summer,  I give all my roses a weekly feed with this mixture on the leaves and at the root (In the early, cool morning), and my roses are taking over the world, clean leaved and repeat blossoming.  I had leaves and blossoms when the rest of the roses in Whatcom County give way to the summer heat.______________________________________________________________Concerning powdery mildew:It happens.  All it takes is one still, humid, warm day and its all over the place, particularly on cucurbitae, tomatoes, and other garden vegetables because powdery mildew hates the human race.Now you need to nut up here.  Diluted human whiz isn't the worst thing you've ever smelled, and assuming it's yours, don't be all squicky.  It came out of you. If you get a little on you, you'll live.  It will not make your garden stinky.  At all.  It will not make your vegetables taste like pee, or your roses smell like pee. But filling that watering can will be an adventure in pork-scented armpit sweat ammonia.  And it will be foamy, too.  That is a good sign.  It  means that your whiz will stick.  Fill the watering can slowly, all the way to the top, and then go and bless the plant in question with your liquid spritz.  I am not even kidding.  I've put this mixture into spray bottles, and, standing in such a way  that the breeze will NOT blow it back on  me, sprinkled large vines and tall plants with this, and it simply arrests the progression of the fungus at the 'dots of fluffy white' stage.  Every. Single. Time.I'll be honest with you here.  I take a number of prescribed psychoactive substances to control ADHD, OCD, PTSD and clinical depression.  I like to think that my plants are 35% saner and less likely to steal your car than other plants.There is no downside."},
{"title": "How to not garden like a dumbshit 3", "date": "Monday, August 13, 2018", "text": "You have come to the best part of gardening.  Kick back.  Read this, get relaxed, sink in.  This isTHE THRILLING EXCITING PART OF GARDENING!!!!    I am going to assume that you did all the gardening things up to this point and ignored the Catholicism references.  And probably the Star Trek references.That would be a mistake.  A space vegetable could crop up in your garden and if you weren't up on your TOS it could climb up your butthole and take over your mind.  Alien vegetables will do shit like that!  Be on the alert!  Nobody wants an alien plant rambling around in their brain!Luckily 99.9999 of plants will be from Earth.Your garden bed is ready. It is spring, April or May.  It has lain over the winter getting good.  It is waiting for plants. You have raked in some more finished* compost.  Now is the time to start thinking.ANNUAL plants only live one year.  If you are a renter, you might want to go this route.  It can get pricey, so I am going to recommend a Frankenannual, a genetically manipulated ornamental garden plant that will give you untold bang for the buck:  The Wave Petunia.  Three of these will cover an area the size of a kiddie pool and keep on going until a hard freeze.  Yes.  The hippie plant freak likes Wave Petunias.  Bite me.  They're environmentally safe, they make oxygen, they're pretty.But what kind of soil ph, sun exposure and climate does the Wave Petunia want?  How to make it show to it's best advantage?LOOK. IT. UP.And go to numerous sites, too.  Use search terms like 'what I hate about Wave Petunias' and 'Problems with Wave Petunias' and 'Best Way To Grow Wave Petunias'.  You will learn a lot more honest information about a plant if you look up it's downside first. Don't get out your monks robes and light a candle and sit up on a tall stool at a tall desk with a quill and ink and study this in isolation and celibacy for weeks; just skim.  You'll get the gist of it.  I can say that Wave Petunias like loose, high-humus soil in full sun with a little afternoon shade, and protection from the wind. You should also lift up the plant mat, every so often, like checking under the covers, and remove any slugs you might find there. Throw the slug into your neighbors yard.How to plant:Prepare the hole first. Dig it, dump in some water.Next:  take off all the open blossoms. Just clip them off. Dump out the plant in a shady place and shake the root-ball gently.  Work your fingers gently through the potting soil and thin roots way to the center stem, being very gentle, trying not to tear the roots, spreading it all out.  A few will tear, but it won't matter if most of them are still attached to the plant.When you make to to the stem:  If this area is all tangled around itself tightly like spaghetti, try and loosen it up by working at it gently with your fingers. If you can't get the roots to unwind, get a nail scissors and cut a couple of these big roots. Leave them there, don't try to untangle them, they won't hurt anything.  This will not hurt or kill the plant as long as you don't cut through the MAIN STEM.  Remember:  this is an annual.  It is DRIVEN TO LIVE.Now.Take this whole handful of mess and put it in the hole, spread out like a pie.  Put back the the dirt, covering all the roots, thoroughly and gently.  Pat it gently all around so the soil makes good contact with the roots. Don't wham on it or stomp it, just patty-pat it like you patty-pat a baby.A Wave Petunia wants to be planted with the leaves right laying on the ground like a carpet, all spread out. Make it so. Then water it, all around the roots and on the leaves with a gentle spray, or better yet, with a watering can that has a sprinkler on the spout.  Get it nice and wet. Don't blast it with a hard stream, just let the water fall like rain.  The planting area will kind of sink in.  This is fine.  A good 5 or 6 seconds should do it.That's it.Walk away.  It will do the rest.  Ignore it.  Call it names.  It won't care.  It will just pump out blossoms across a large area, blithely unaware of your abuse and neglect.Did you take my word for that?  Don't be a dipshit.  LOOK IT UP.  What kind of soil does the Wave Petunia like?  What Ph?  What sun/shade exposure?  How often do you water?  Does it want a little extra feeding around midsummer or so?LOOK  IT  UP._________________________________________Now let's say you actually own a home.  Well done, Trump era survivor!One of the easiest PERENNIAL PLANTS  to grow is the German Iris.  Also known as Grandmas' Iris and Fleur de Lis Iris.  This is the plant you've seen a million times, it's leaves starting straight up like short-bladed swords from the root, which lies like a creepy gnarled potato halfway above the soil.  The leaves are of a bluish cast and remain very bold and upright even after the blossom finishes.This flower comes in a million different colors.  It's been bred for so many years by so many people that you can choose whatever crazy combination of beard, uprights, fall and uprights (look it up!) your heart desires. It's nuts!  People collect them!  They're incredibly easy and friendly lil' guys.Now, you've been good and done your studying.  You know your soil type, you know what conditions the German Iris requires. Most importantly, you have looked at how German Irises grow, which is at a right angle to the root. Ok. Now.   Scratch a shallow area, making the soil in the declivity nice and loose.  Sprinkle some water in. Plop in the iris, with its soil and rootlets opened up and spread out - there will be smaller roots coming off the big main ones.  So. Plop goes the iris.  Sprinkle soil back over the iris.  Don't bury the thing all the way over the root.  NO. Just sprinkle some soil on, and then water, and then sprinkle a little more and cover a little more, until there is a little bit of the big root showing above ground and it will stand up by itself.  If it won't stand up by itself, prop it up with sticks. Another solution is to pile pea gravel on it to make it stand up.  The roots will eventually push their way above it, and in the meantime they'll be getting the air and light they seem to want.Let's say you want to get all fancy.  This is your first garden bed, but you want to push the envelope!  Strive for greatness! Good for you!  That's the gardening spirit! (Or the Holy Spirit. I'm as lost as you are in the whole Catholicism analogy stuff.)Pick out a German Iris and a Wave Petunia in complimentary colors, remembering that the leaves of the iris will outlast its blooms, and stand for the rest of the growing season to make a bold, bluish fan shape. Your iris will bloom in May.  Each single blossom will last for 2 or 3 days, but other buds will come out of sheathes on the stem and so you'll get blooms for about a month.  Keep the wilted blooms cleaned off - you just pick them off.  Why?  Because I fucking said so.  Enjoy watching the fat bumblebees wriggle and jiggle their way in to get at the nectar, and come out all dusty with pollen and fly off in a little cloud of gold dust.And there you go. Around mid to late May your Wave Petunia will start ramping up and going nuts.  And there you have it:  A a nice little arrangement for next to the front door or wherever, and unless a human or a dog directly pees on it all, it will live with minimal care.You have a garden!_____________________________*Finished compost?

{"title": "How not to garden like a dumbfuck 2", "date": "Friday, August 10, 2018", "text": "Well look at you, all back here and everything, bright eyed and bushy tailed, waiting for me to deliver unto you the esoteric knowledge of the ages, the complicated secrets of encouraging a plant from the soil into the light of day for whatever goddamn reason.Remember how I told you there are two types of ornamental garden plants.  Now if you're TOS this may or may not apply to, say, Acamarian parthas or quadrotriticale, although if it did, then quadrotriticale would be an annual, and Acmarian parthas would be perennials.  Yes I am that good.  Let's assume that you're not growing fictional plants, though.Things you will need to know if you want to grow ornamental plants.-That's what this part is called.  Keep up.1. You have to learn about your environment.I don't know what country you are planting your plants in.  Or even what part of your country.  That shit's up to you to figure out.  Now I can oversimplify and tell  you 'Don't grow a saguaro cactus on the slopes of Mt. Everest because it's stupid.'  Cactuses grow in the desert, don't ask me how.  Lichens and moss grow waaaaay up near the top of Mt. Everest, though, with the fungal endophytes and tardigrades (not a plant, but a very, very tiny form of dugong.)  I'm sure other shit grows lower down, but once you get way up there on Mt. Everest, it's pretty much lichen and very very tiny dugongs.  Now lichen, being a diverse bunch of algae and fungus all intermingled in plantal harmony, that shit is adaptable.  It can grow pretty much anywhere, but saguaro cacti cannot.  They only grow in the desert.  That's just the way it is.Every single plant has it's own particular likes and dislikes.Muks Gardening Prime Directive:  Do your research.1.  Your country probably has an agricultural bureau that will tell you what your elevation is, and what kind of soil you have, and when your first and last frost dates are.  They may also tell  you what agricultural zone you live in.  I don't know.  I haven't gone into this because I'm American and I don't have to know anything I don't want to; particularly if it has to do with geography.  But I'd be willing to bet that if you ask around the old people in town, you can find out these very important facts:Your soil type - sandy, loamy, duff, clay, what have you.  This knowledge tells you about the ability for water, air and roots to move through your dirt.   You have to know this.Now ask them, or look it up, or fire a flaming arrow with a message attached through the appropriate window, I don't give a fuck, just FIND OUT WHAT YOUR SOIL PH IS.This is so important it's like the Virgin Mary of gardening knowledge.  That's a Catholic comparison - analogy thing there.*So.  Know What Your Soil PH is.  What does PH mean?  Look it up.  This information is super vital information.  Soil ph determines what nutrients your plants can pull out of the soil.  It can also be altered without killing the environment as long as you keep your efforts small.2.  Know what your climactic zone is. (The Holy Spirit of Gardening.  In case you forgot.)  Our standard of measure in the U.S.A  is called the USDA zone, and it's a suggestion at best given the rapidity of climate change. On paper, I rate a zone 7a.  Bullshit!  In actual fact, I'm a zone 6a.  That is a world of difference, although it sounds small.Your Zone is an arbitrary number given to the information returned from climactic monitoring.   A Zone is an area that has a reliably stable date of first frost,  lowest winter temperature, and highest summer temperature.That is your fucking USDA ZONE. Now, troops:  What is your zone?  All  together:  A Zone is an area that has a reliably stable date of first frost,  lowest winter temperature, and highest summer temperature.Your version of the USDA is probably trying the best it can to keep up with shit, but they're probably also a government agency.  This is really important information and you need to get it right, so again, you go by the old people in your area, who will know this stuff all the way back to Tutankhamen. Ask.3. (The Jesus rule.)  Ask your neighbors and keep records of your seasonal temps and weather.  This doesn't need to be anything more than a little notebook.  Don't rely on the USDA. 20 miles down the road from I live, in a small area that is not only protected by surrounding mountains but has a strong geothermal influence, Deming, WA.   It's a straight up zone 8b-7a.  The locals refer to it as 'The Banana Belt'.  Anyfucking thing will grow there, allowing for the natural acidity of the soil.  Acidity of the soil,  you ask?  Look back at SOIL PH, get that straight, and then get back to me. Remember Jesus, the friendly hippie dude?  Be like Jesus.  Be friendly.  Ask around.  You see somebody out in their yard with a shovel, stop and talk.  All gardeners are awesome.  Some are unreasonably violent at random moments, but in between those episodes they are very mellow, friendly people willing to help and give you plants and everything.  Until they chase you around with a machete.  They'll apologize afterward.Muk gardening truism:  The nuttier the person, the better their garden grows.  This is absolutely true. 100% all the way true.  Crazy fuckers grow incredible plants.  I've seen this so many times it's just stupid.  Take me for example.  I am crazy as a shithouse rat, and I have a garden that people ask for tours through.  Oh yes. Dead serious.4. OK This is the God The Father level of your garden!!!  This is literally how it all begins.In the Beginning was the Word, and the Word was PREPARATION.    Would you like to make a nice flower bed? Then dig it up and prepare it in the fall before. How?Suggestion:  You could begin a compost heap. (We're still on God the Father, so sit still.  You want to go sit in the baby room with all the little wah wah babies?  No you don't. So quit acting up and be still and pay attention. I mean it.)Anything made of plants goes into compost heap.  Anything made of meat does not. It's just a pile of old leaves, grass clippings, hedge cuttings, whatever is made out of a plant.  Salad.  Turnips.  Just heap it up and let it rot over winter.  Toss it around like spaghetti a bit with a pitchfork or a shovel a couple of times. Either way, it rots into lovely compost, which is made out of...guess.  No, guess.  OK fine.  Worm shit.  That's called humus.  But it's shit from worms. They do all the work!Simple!And the best part?  It does not smell bad.  It smells sweet, like after it rains.More Realistic Suggestion:  Get some bagged steer manure from your local big box home center.  Get a bunch.4.  Now you begin.Pick out a section of ground, grass and all, and using a garden hose or a rope, line out a nice shape.   Using a garden hose is best.  Make an outline that looks pretty,  and when you get something you like,  turn up turves to mark it -  and then roll up the garden hose and put it away, dump your COMPOST onto that outlined area and  rototill the piss out of it. Cut that organic matter in there!Now what does this mean, exactly? Imagine a rotary beater working sideways, with knives instead of vanes. That's what a rototiller does, and you get to drive it!  It's cutting all that compost into the dirt and cutting up all the grass and roots and opening up the soil for air to get in, and mixing it all up.  Kickass, huh?  You are whuppin' up on this garden bed situation.If you use a rototiller, do not wear sandals.  Only Jesus can get away with that.  The man wears a thorn garland, kids; he's cold steel.  You are not.So. If you have a rototiller, fantastic.  If you can rent one, bitchin'.   If you don't, you can do this with a shovel, pray God you have sandy loam soil, because it's easy to dig.  I have blue clay overlaid with a six inch layer of ancient, pure decomposed plant material and duck crap - an ionic black sediment that is like crack for plants. For that matter, so is the blue clay substrate.  (I live on what was a shallow lake back in the late 1800s.)Any way you can get that compost in there, and that sod broken up, and that soil aerated, you go for it.  And then?Leave it lay there for the rest of the winter.     Let it get rained on and frozen and snowed on and all that winter shit.  Let your soil get good.  It needs to mix around, like stew, wake up those fungus-mushroom-mychorhyzae and relationships and worms and microorganisms and oogy things going oog oog through your soil, and just let them play around and swap spit and poop and so forth all winter long inside that rototilled shape you made. Leave it alone.  All winter long.5.  Next Spring.  Throw another load of compost on there and scuffle it in with a rake.  This is assuming you have nice loamy soft soil.(Me?  Oh hell no.  I had to dig  4 ft. deep basins, deal?  Like shallow ponds!  In wet clay!  And I used tarps to pile up all the removed soil on.  I dug out the whole shape, not just a hole here and a hole there.  The whole fuckin' thing.  Multiple beds 4 feet deep, on four city lots.  My arms literally burst the seams of my t-shirts when I flex my biceps from doing this shit.  Am I bad?  I can change your tires without using a jack, baby.  Fear this.Our awesome little town has it' own compost heap.  They even chip the vegetative debris, which made me skippity happy like a little girl. I went and asked could I raid the pile and they looked at me and fell down and kissed my feet and cried with joy, would I take some?  Take it ALL!  They really said that!  So I took that raw, uncomposted plant material home by the truckload and dumped all this undifferentiated new and old squack from the city compost heap - huge branches, leaves, grass clippings, anything that didn't have striped moon snails in it - into the bottom in an even layer, and then it was built back up in layers.  Soil, then squack, then more soil, then more squack, then more soil.I was much, much younger then.  Would I do that today FUCK NO. But it worked like a charm.)So, where were we?  Oh yes, standing outside in the early Springtime, getting rained on, scuffling some finished compost into the top layer of your bed-to-be.  You can buy this stuff, like I said, but I use something different.  I live in farm country. I add what  a farmer down the road supplies me with, for free...a magic substance, aged, composted, light as a feather, easy as pie to work with... called 'Lagoonage'.Remember this word.  Dairy farmers have it. Cow farmers have it.  They are crying to find someone to take it away because it's a nuisance to them.  They will give it to you.  For FREE. It is...LAGOONAGE.     It's the solids they skim off of liquefied cowshit and pile aside so they can use the plain nastyass shit liquid to spray on their fields and ruin your whole day, nasally.  Cows don't digest everything they eat, and those solids are just about the best thing going to put in your soil, and to put on top of your soil as well.  It has a neutral PH (oh Goddammit, there's that fuckin' scientific term again. Look it up. SUFFER.)   As it degrades over time, it releases a whole complex of different organisms, fungi, microbes and trace minerals into the soil whenever it rains, or you water, or life and time just happen.  It is magic from a cows butthole.All this rotted  plant material helps to lighten - open up - the soil structure.  There is no soil that cannot benefit from this treatment.  You need to get some actual OXYGEN in there along with the old plant material so that the breakdown and decomp will  continue, and as it does all that decomposing and breaking down it is also releasing lots of different minerals and compounds into the soil, and that makes the little bugly organism wormy dudes happy, and they poop out humus.  Decomposition and breakdown works much better and faster with oxygen, though. It keeps your worms and bugly buddies happy, and the tardigrades rejoicing.  You use your shovel for this, or a rake even.  Just toss in a shovel of lagoonage and scuffle a shovel of dirt over it.  Very good exercise, light and pleasant, and it will give you the pecs of a young god.There are other things you can use in place of lagoonage, of course.  Some places sell sewage solids, which is not as gross as it sounds although  it's supposed to be high in  heavy metals, like lead and shit.  I don't know.   You can use feedlot manure, chicken shit, maple leaves...good Lord; you're online!  Look up your region!  Go on Daves Garden.Com and look up what other people in your area are using for organic compost!  I'm not your mother!So assuming you did all this, which is not as hard as it sounds given a rototiller and/or light soil structure...?THEN, YOU PLANT.**Get ready for this one.  Loosen up.  Do some stretches.  No more bourbon on your Captain Crunch.Using a hand mirror, ensure that you have no catarrh nor any fantods.I mean it.  This next part is metaphysical!  Gardening is sacred!  This  shit will blow you away if you aren't in tune with the Earth vibration!  NOW  comes the spiritual constituent!  This is where pure mind meets simple soil and the body of Christ digs up old tree roots and pieces of cement!Next: THE THRILLING EXCITING PART OF GARDENING   ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________*You got four heavenly important people going on in Catholicism:a.The Virgin Mary. Everybody loves her. No matter what you've up to, She'll just shrug and say \"You know what, you be you, baby.\"  She knows how bad you feel when you do wrong.  She'll give you a hug and a kiss and put a bandaid on your spiritual pain  The Virgin Mary is really, really nice and all kinds of happening.b. The Holy Spirit.This is some deep stuff going on.Nobody quite knows what the Holy Spirit is, but it's important.  They usually show it as a lovely white dove all spread out with sometimes a halo or a circle of glowing rays coming from it.  It's...just important.  It's like what Godliness feels like inside you.  Now, I would have come up with a better analogy that a flying rat, but they did this in the old days.  It is meant to convey a butterfly feeling of joy and love and cosmic union with Universal Godhood and Goodness. I told you it was heavy.c.  JesusNow see, even though he's supposed to be the Big Kahuna, the Word made Flesh, God in Man, this is where he lands on the scale of Catholic Importance. Here's how to tell if you've partied with Jesus:  He's a white guy, very friendly looking, with long brown hair, a well-kept beard and moustache, and he's wearing a long white nightgown kind of thing with a belt, and sandals.  Like Spock in Star Trek 4:  The Voyage Home. Spock wore a white headband.  But Jesus is Metal as All Get Out.  Jesus wears a wreath made of horrifying thorny vines that jam way into his head with blood coming down all on his face. Yes.If he's wearing any headgear at all, this is what he prefers. Also sometimes he's wearing his heart on the outside of his clothes!  Seriously!  And with fire spouting from the top of his heart, thorny vines all wrapped around his actual heart organ, poked into it and making it bleed.  And he always has this loving, gentle expression on his face while he indicates his bleeding, tore-up outside heart with flames shooting out of the top of it out on the front of his clothes, which you got to admit is quite notably Hardcore Metal As All Get Out. But think about it:   if Jesus is that hardcore, imagine how rad God the Father is!d. God the FatherHe is majestic.  He is mysterious.  He is The Capo di Tutti Capo.You piss him off, he will smite you. That's what he does. You don't get a whap on the hind end. No.  Fire will rain out of the sky and blood will be all in the water and people will turn into salt. The guy simply does not mess around when he's doing some smiting. It's best not to piss him off. Now, that said, it takes a lot of bullshit going on for a long time before he gets to the point where he says 'That's it, I'm going to smite you\" and floods the whole earth. He does cool things too, like make water flow out of bare rock, and create the whole Earth and planets and stars and the entire UNIVERSE.  He is so magnificent they don't even show him most of the time!  There'll be some glowing huge amazing cloud with angels and shit all around it, pretty winged youths,flying babies, flying babyheads, the whole schmeer, with rays coming out of the cloud all done in gold leaf.  I know Michelangelo painted him as an old , yet buff, flying guy in a nice lavender undershirt, but after that everyone figured 'That was Michelangelo!  Who's gonna follow that act?\" so they went with the Glowing Cloud of Almighty God the Father and Assorted Winged Beings.  He is the guy who does all the heavy lifting behind the scenes, the Author of All.  And what was the first thing he did for mankind?Gave us a garden to live in.If your theology differs, I don't care. I'm an agnostic now."},

If your self esteem is that low, join a cult.  They'll tell you how great you are until they squeeze some cash out of you, and then it's nothing but heartache, so don't give them any cash, but talk about how you're going to soon.  Keep'em hungry.  Heh.If you want to garden like me, which you should because I garden awesome, get rid of your dumb self-talk at once.  I am going to take you through this assuming you are a novice gardener, because otherwise why would this post title have attracted your attention?  Unless you are masturbating to it.  And if you are it's fine.  You do you.1. Plants always dieeeeeeeeeeeeEverything dies.  Geeze.  That having been said, some plants die in a year, and some wait a while longer.  That is because there are two types of garden plants!  Gasp!  Clutch the pearls!  But it's true. There are Two Different Types of Ornamental Garden Plants. Cue the angel choir!  Just not the freaky flying baby heads.  They just make everyone uncomfortable.A.Annuals.  From the Latin 'annus' which means 'year'.  Go ahead.  Snicker.  They were an early civilization; they didn't know.  Their word for 'anus' was 'culus'.  Go back in time and call somebody an anus in Rome, like 'You Roman anus, you' and they'd just look at you weird.  We have to set the wayback machine ahead to 1658, for....wait for it....France. Imagine that. Now step up to some French person carrying their ancient baguette down the sidewalk and say 'You anus French person with your baguette there,' and they'd look at you weird because you probably don't speak ancient French.  Don't go bothering the ancient French that way.  They have enough problems.SO.  An ANNUAL is a plant that is only meant to be alive for one year.One.Just one. Like your common Garden Petunia, which is a good example of an annual.  You see, they're born that way.  During their short time in this vale of tears they grow vigorously and put out lots of nice enticing blossoms to be pollinated because they have to gather up enough energy in  one year to push into producing seeds; and that's because seeds are the only chance at a future they've got.  That's all a garden petunia gets in the way of a future....a tiny seed.  Posterity is a harsh concept for an annual.   So quit  looking at your deadass garden petunias in the fall and blaming yourself.  It was foreordained.  Part of the Great Mystery Of Life.B.Perennials.  From the Latin 'Penis', perennials are plants that stick up all over the place while they're young, and then not so much the older they get.  That's a lie, but you get the idea, and the analogy is sound.Perennials store energy. They aren't so much into making seeds, although they'll try it half-heartedly. The top part dies off in winter and then in spring it begins to grow back.  It is a miracle.Actually it is a function of energy storing plant structures.A good example of a perennial plant is a Dandelion.  Yes it's a fucking weed but it's a good example and I'm aiming at a broad audience here.The Dandelion has a wide root that begins immediately below the foliage This area right below where the stem and leaves begin, this wide part, is called 'the crown'.  This is the top of a huge long central root that goes far into the ground, and that whole root and crown serves as a place for the dandelion to store enough energy to get the important part of the plant through bad weather.  With a perennial, the important part of the plant - in its opinion - is the crown.  Not the leaves or the flowers.  The root and the crown.  The leaves and flowers and small rootlets all serve to harvest energy to preserve the life of the crown.(There is a parallel to this in history, back in the Kings and Queens days, like, the farmers would bring food to the king and he'd refrain from burning the farmer out of his thatched-roof cottage for another year.  Kings would do shit like that.  Seriously. The early French called this 'Anus royale'.  They did.But even if you didn't bring some groceries to the king, your neighbors probably would have, so the King would be living large all winter, producing heirs, eating parsnips and cabbages and farting prodigiously and to appalling effect on that diet, and you're left looking at the smoking remains of your thatched roof cottage thinking 'Next year, brick.'  Except you'd freeze to death.  You: disposable leaf.  King:  crown.  Geddit?  Huh?  King-crown?)This is why you can mow a dandelion, slice the whole top of it off, pry part of it out of the ground, dump various chemicals on it and the bastard will just laugh and a few weeks later there the little fucker is with new leaves, trying to be all stealth.Similarly, then, an ornamental , or Garden Perennial.    You stick it in the ground and it dies back in autumn and you fall down on your knees crying your anguish into the empty skies, and then next spring there it pops up again, and you think 'Well what the fuck is that?  I didn't put that there' and you dig it's ass up and throw it out, ya dipshit.EVERYBODY DOES THIS WHEN THEY FIRST START GARDENING.  It doesn't make you any less a moron, but it does mean that you have a lot of company.So.  We got two different types of plants.  Annual = one year, then kerplotz. Nothing you can do about it.Perennial:  comes up every year in the spring for at least three years.OK! We've got that straight!ANNUALS only live for one year, then they fuckin' DIE.PERENNIALS live for 3 or more years.If you plant a PERENNIAL, then, put a marker next to the plant.  A few inches away.  I use a sophisticated stick scrounged out of my compost heap for the class factor.  It lets me know \"I intentionally planted something here, next to where this straight tall stick is, here in the ground.\"  If something grows up close to the stick, let it alone.  It's the perennial you put in last year.That was lesson one.  You're on the internet; go take a look around.  Look up annuals and perennials.Don't do any buying yet, just look around.  Get an idea of what you're seeing.  Read the descriptions.  Whatever plant catches your eye.  It's a nice way to kill an afternoon.NEXT WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE ITS THRILLING INSTALLMENT:  A FAIRLY MINIMAL AMOUNT OF BORING SHIT YOU HAVE TO KNOW SO GET OVER IT NOW."},

Be so, so still.One buck and five deer with fawns step with deliberate feet through and by.  Look to the right or the left.  They bend their heads to the places your hand has rested, and wait through the heat of the day beneath old apple trees forgotten in your neighbors' back yard, in the clusters of low pine and hemlock all curtained with pincherry nightshade along the alleys, all of the deer soft breathing the day and soft exhaling the smell of crushed grass and sour milk, home where you live.This is true. Listen.  Animals from the stories your mother read you are asleep deep in tangled gloom,  circle once, circle five times around, sleeping in the softest strands of deep green grass, the kind that grows in the margins between blackberry tangles and the objects their thorns devour. Make your circle around the moon.When night comes, foxes and bobcats and cougar and coyote and dogs and loping wolves come to break the necks of fool animals who let themselves in too close to you.   Animals with the expectation of of a next day will end their lives in diminishing gasps being carried off to secret places.  Now think of the stars reflected in their eyes or the moonless night. Make a circle around the moon and hold it in one place.Wild is what cats stare at when you think there's nothing there.  Consider how their claws sheathe in a curl like their kin, who roam in the same ways and hunt in the same ways for blood and meat. They draw dark alongside your garage and stop-The cat you feed is deliberate and swift making mysteries and unexplained disappearances, peace behind their eyes as they watch you fill the dish.All cats from all families are one cat gone down ravines, complaining of their love up draws and drawing thin silver v's through the grasses toward the places where they bide. That's cats.Listen.  This is about dogs. Moon dogs. Calling dogs. Silent dogs listening.  Roaming determined dogs wearing the nonchalance of freedom that look you in the eye with cool minds. These are your fellow citizens, neighbor.Dogs flow with the wind on their own errands.Think hard about what dogs mean, in words you won't listen to, the story of generations after generations of shunned dogs, abandoned dogs, lost dogs, tame, gone hungry and semi tame, raised less tame,  noticed by nobody yet walking, nosing, going to and fro in the earth, and walking up and down in it.Everything is black when a cloud hides the moon.You should look for where people you forget make homes.  Wise nimble-minded dogs full of luck and worn deep around their throats with old collars and with battered tags that clatter remember.   Mice will come. The same mice so dear, the same mice on the grass with broken spines with their small paws folded like praying.Rats dart and snatch.  Rats are greed and breathe blood.  Their teeth curl downward toward bone.  Break open the roof of their caches and see!  Small gold stones.Crows cut like scissors.Ravens tear and sideslink heavily just out of reach.Others arrive.Cars drive over a bridge.More. Listen.Behind the smile of that dog, those are teeth, and they grab and snatch fast, you see, the wind of their going blowing from when outlier dog-wolves and slinking starved bitches in milk, wolves who ran to save their skins,  circled the dimness and swallowed and swallowed in anticipation.  Smelling, one eye cautious, skittish, maybe toward where a special animal warmth like a moon waits just past the edge of the safe.We don't own the advantage:  the consensus, the democracy of pheromones.What we have is height and the predators' face forward sight and the memory we want, of good dogs who lived in homes and obeyed a voice.Not all memories tell you what you need.Look at where you don't look. Black bears hide the day away beneath abandoned cars and holes torn jaggedly around the tangled roots of downed trees, half drowsing,  waiting for the night-damp to sharpen the smells of the heaps they prowl around and over and through, rooting and straining with bold black claws for caches of things that are spoiled and soft and fat with grease.  Black bears are stealthy walkers and sliders and whisperers through twigs and crackling frost kill and the grassed brush on the margins of trails meandering through your town, your suburb, your development, eating the food you waste and remembering the taste of your hands and mouth.Up in the top of a tall tree bark colored owls tear strips from prey held fast in one fist, and their gaze turns to you.  Silence, one hook and eight knives, an owl.Patient pale owls watching from empty rectangles in city buildings, generations raised in the rising frost of spent feathers and the pin bones of bats, in lath-fallen rooms and stairwells and high in blind tin architraves.  They fly down the narrow hallways white, out into the blizzards of moths and bats around the street lights.  Did you know that the moon was shining when the imagos split and moths came out of the dirt to fly in confusions and clouds?These things see.Cats see, and the smart ones darken away fast, fast between the wheels of cars, fast in front of bicycles, only a fast line moving across a two lane road from one ditch to the next.  Cats see from trees and windows, smart covered corners where they are just another shade of grey on black, a pile of leaves, and they see, and they run fast, climb fast and go quiet.  They see where deer have walked and look over their shoulders, and run from darkness to darkness.Let go of the moon.Do nothing and don't wait.  The soil will open.Do nothing and don't wait.  The three families of dogs circle you and circle you.Do nothing and don't wait.  The cats will rouse from their cautious sleep and escape before their betters.Do nothing and don't wait.  Larger presences are just outside the circle and they never learned to heed you.Do nothing. Don't wait.  The moon goes dark for two days in twenty-nine."},
{"title": "Please Don't Hurt Me Lynda Barry I Will Never Talk Smack About You Again", "date": "Tuesday, October 17, 2017", "text": "My best, earliest memory that is longer than a couple of sentences, told with deliberately bad sentence structure because what I said about Lynda Barry totally applies to me as well.When I was 4 years old my parents dressed me up and took me over to my cousins' house for an important party.  My girl cousin Theresa was turning 'Sweet Sixteen' and her parents were throwing her a big hullabaloo.  Being good Catholic parents, of course, it was teeners in the basement with their jungle music and every guests' parents present,  the daylight basement windows and floor vents open and the basement door ajar.So there I was at a grown up party, dressed up like a toilet paper dolly, and I was 4. I was the only person there who was 4. The closest person to 4 there was my cousin Theresa, and she wanted to put up with me like cats want to put up with dogs. Aunt Lillian said I could go downstairs to the party.  My cousin Theresa right there in front of me actually started crying and begged her mom please don't let her come downstairs and Ruin Her Party.(Future me:  bad move, ya dumb cow.)The husbands were outside barbecuing and smoking the cigars Uncle Sonny passed out and drinking Canadian Club.  My boy cousins were in the back playing hula-golf .  The wives were inside, drinking Canadian Club on the rocks with Grenadine and smoking and pretending to eat my aunt Lillians terrible canapes (I've written about this womans' horrifying table elsewhere) and talking about boring things.  I was three feet shorter than the shortest person in the joint.  Everyone was either half-lit or doing the Frug in the basement...so for all intents and purposes,  I was completely unsupervised. I went downstairs and it looked exactly like this:http://www.carameloffers.com/img/c8.alamy.com/comp/CMR85J/1950s-1960s-teen-couples-having-party-dancing-in-rec-room-CMR85J.jpgOne of the boys was really nice and came over and actually pretended to dance with me!  He was tall and had a blonde crew cut.  I instantly fell in love with him. Since it was a record party, everyone had brought their collection of 45's and got to take turns picking songs. Some dumb butt put a stupid slow record on.  It was stupid square Little Surf Girl by the stupid square Beach Boys - which immediately alerted the parents to the possibility of Slow Dancing and Kissing.  From upstairs the moms started hollering threats down the floor vents that there better not be any funny business going on.  Little Surf Girl plus moms yelling \"You better not be up to anything down there ELIZABETH AND GREGG I MEAN YOU!\" equals Total Uncoolness Party.  I had standards.  I went back upstairs. Immediately my mother sprang on me and made me take a shitty canape and say 'Thank you' for it to Aunt Lilian.  It was a pimento olive slice on top of a hot dog slice on top of peanut butter on top of a Ritz cracker with a toothpick stuck in it. Can you imagine the horror?  Luckily I was close to the floor.  Here's why.Before I had even had a chance to begin snivelling, my Aunt and Uncles' black Lab Tommy, slobberingly overexcited, panting and everywhere at once, ran through the room and grabbed it out of my hand, and his enormous red dog ween was totally showing out.This was not the kind of party guest any good Catholic mother wants to see.Aunt Lillian freaked. All the moms went into 'rat in the henhouse' mode and more than a few of them were snickering into their wrists even though what they'd just had seared onto their eyeballs was Not Nice.  The cigarette ashes were falling and canapes by the double handful were sneaked into the trash!  Aunt Lilian, bubble do, cat glasses, dirndle and all took out after Tommy the dog at a sprint.  I followed her because I wanted to see what she'd do.  My mom followed me with another shitty canape to make sure I actually ate one, but I caught sight of her and suddenly jinked left and ran behind the house into the evergreen hedge and hid.Even though it was very poky, being inside the evergreen hedge was cool to the max.  You could actually stand up in it and not touch (almost.)  It was a perfect hiding place in every way.  It made an arched tunnel all the way around the house.  It was also full of play balls of every description, thanks to Tommy, because he'd go around the neighborhood and steal them from everyone and the secret tunnel inside the hedge was his stashing place. Tommy and I were both in refugee mode, so he found his way into the hedge and soon thereafter found me.At 4 I did not like any dogs.  Either they were taller than me and knocked me down, or smaller than me and bitey.  And here Tommy was all up in my grill, needy and overexcited, slobbering and panting and smacking the side of the house with a tail like a baseball bat, wanting me to play fetch.  He kept picking up every ball and bringing it to me like if he found the right one I'd play.  Totally no way Jose, dog. Tommy was gross.  He always had long blops of foamy slobber hanging out of the two flubby parts of the side of his mouth, which also stuck out and flubbered and looked like something washed up on the beach.  Now here he was all a-wag, with his slobber full of hemlock crud stuck in it hanging from his flubby dog lips wabbling and swinging all over the place, and the ball he proffered was all covered with dried slobber that was mixed with wet slobber and ball fragments and Christ knew what,   so I took the ball and threw it as hard as I could out into the street and a car almost ran over him. Almost.  Sooo close.I did not like that dog.The people in the car screeched to a halt and got out and ran into the driveway!  My Uncle Sonny, tall, bald and built like a fullback came hustling out of the garage with his shiny head glistening in the sun to meet them and they all had a screaming argument!   When the people told Uncle Sonny that the dog had been chasing a ball I froze.  I was quiet and waited, but nobody came looking for me because Uncle Sonny immediately blamed it on the boys.  The people finally drove away while my uncle Sonny was still yelling at the boys for throwing balls into the street.  I was safe!  So I hauled down my skivvies and peed and got it all over my little lacy ankle socks.When you are 4 and a girl, you are way down in the weeds when you squat to pee so it goes everywhere.  And never pee in a hemlock hedge because it will poke the crap out of you and you could hoist ass and get pee on your socks.Nothing daunted, I crept my way around the foundation of the house, using the natural tunnel the plantings had created, the rock-n-roll music coming from the basement through the open daylight windows, feeling very secret-ey and tuff. There were some good go go music playing and I wanted to dance too.  I got thinking about my mean stupid cousin Theresa and her me only you have to go away party.  Oh yeah, Theresa? Oh yeah?  I went back to the first open window to the basement, collected as many tore up play balls as I could carry, and threw them into the basement through the window.  Every window I passed I'd grab a few balls off the ground from the hundreds there and throw them into the basement as I went.  It was so great and fun because it made everyone start screaming and the records skip.  Happy Sweet Sixteen, Cousin Turd-resa!Once I was on the opposite side of the house, in the back yard, I figured I was as safe as I was going to get.  I ran out and WHAMMO  a bummerball (a used golf ball with a red ring of paint around it's equator) smacked into the side of the house right next to me. (It wasn't on purpose.)  While I was marvelling at that, I got caught by my boy cousins and their buddies who thought it was puss to dance with girls and were the ones out in the back yard playing hula golf.  OK.  They said I had to go run around the whole back yard and find all their stupid golf balls or they'd tell on me that I wasn't in the house. Looking back I can't remember there being anything said about me needing to stay in the house.  It worked, though.My oldest boy cousin Raymond  was 17 and he looked exactly like the oldest boy in the T.V. show My Three Sons and he was sooo handsome.  Mostly he ignored me.  My next older boy cousin was 15 and puggy and snotnosed and mean and looked like a dumb stupid butt and was named Richie.   I was wearing a little polkadot dress that looked like this:   https://witness2fashion.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/mc-5365-and-6384-1960-and-1962.jpgSo ok man, geeze, be cool.  I ran around the edge of their huge back yard and I filled my skirt with stupid bummerballs.  When I couldn't fit any more into the skirt of my little dress I ran over to my cousin Ritchie, the one who looked like a dumb stupid butt and who was dog poop also.  I acted like hey here's your golf balls but instead I flipped my skirt out at him and all the golf balls hit him and rolled everywhere and all the other boys laughed and I ran into the garage where my dad was. My dad picked me up just because I was there.  My dad smelled good, like gasoline, tobacco, outdoors and booze.  I was so safe.  Cousin Ritchie came in all bluster faced and waa waa waa'd she hit me with golf balls to Uncle Sonny about me. All the dads made fun of Ritchie and Uncle Sonny grabbed him by the arm and kicked him out of the garage and out he went, crying and with snot hanging down.  Which, HA on you, Ritchie.  He never changed either.  He was the exact same when he was older and married.  Ew.My dad held me for a long time. He was standing in a semicircle around the engine of the car with some of the other dads, smoking a cigar.  It was nice.  I was way up high to where you could look down and see right through parts around the engine to the floor of the garage!  But the cigar smoke was bothering me, and I was getting squirmy and bored, so my dad put me down. I had an amazing idea! I crawled under the car so I could surprise them!  And I did!  Lying in a puddle engine oil and metal shavings and dirt I shouted \"HI!!!\"  Boy, were they surprised!   Suddenly I had a bunch of arms trying to grab me.   I was laughing and scrabbling around on the floor under the car trying to escape.  Someone grabbed my shoe, which looked like this: http://www.thedetoxwarrior.com/image/cache/data/category_139/superior-mary-janes-polo-ralph-lauren-alyssa-mary-jane-little-kid-girls-black-742-800x640_0.jpgToo slow, gotta go!  One shoe on and one shoe off I ran back into the house and down the stairs into my girl cousins Sweet Sixteen party again. The boy I was in love with danced with me again and I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said yes.  Then he danced with another girl and I cried.  My cousin Theresa told me to bug out of her party and get lost, but another girl told Theresa she was mean so I got to stay.  I got to take turns dancing with all the boys.  Someone put on 'Do The Twist' and everybody showed me how to do the Twist!  I climbed up onto the ping-pong table and I did the twist like a go-go girl! When the record was over I tried to climb down but one side of the ping pong table collapsed.I slid down, clanged off the snack table and  dumped over the punch bowl which was almost empty anyway.  Wow!  Humungous Freak-O-Rama!!!!!  With my enraged cousin Theresa close behind, I shot upstairs and scuffed my knee on the stairway (and got a case of gross ringworm later on in the same spot), cousin Theresa with murder in her eyes, in tears, disheveled, trying to catch me and probably eat me.  But she was too slow because she was wearing heel shoes.Of course she went straight to Aunt Lillian waa waa waa and tattle-babied on me that I was ruining her party.  She got in HUGE trouble!  Aunt Lillian grabbed her by the arm and actually SPANKED HER at her own first grown-up party in the middle of all the moms and my mom started yelling at me and tried to grab ME by the arm but I ran upstairs and sat on the top step and and refused to come down for a really long time and everyone forgot about me.  My cousin Theresas' cheerleading megaphone was on the top step.  I sang 'I Love You Yeah Yeah Yeah' into it, not loud enough for anyone to hear but me.  It sounded pretty good like my voice was coming from a record.  I sang all the Beatles songs I knew, then I got bored and came back downstairs.It was a very agitated group of women downstairs there in Aunt Lillians front room.  In the wake of the upset, all the moms were cranked into high gear, ice cubes crackling as drinks were freshened,  lighters sparking as they lit up,  and cigarettes sizzling as they were stubbed out angrily into the half-eaten canapes on Aunt Lillians' good saucers.  The smell of Ronson, cheap Maybelline lipstick and tobacco smoke filled the air.  They were all complaining really loudly about their terrible kids and how horrible they were,  and they were comparing punishment techniques (they'd been hitting the Canadian Club pretty hard.)  It was like they turned into monsters!  I just stood in the middle of it all with a little paper cup full of Aunt Lillians crappy diet Koolaid someone had given me and was kind of appalled, as much as a 4 year old kid can get appalled anyway.  And in the middle of all that my mom just swiftly took me outside and then we all got in the car and snuck home. It wasn't a very long drive.  I got out and my mom finally got a good look at me.  There I was! I had on one shoe and my white tights were tore out on both knees and I was covered in dirt and dog slobber, my socks were wet and I smelled like pee and I had hemlock crud in my hair, my braids were all coming undone, AND I had grease and red koolaid ON MY NEW CHURCH DRESS (Total lie. It was a hand me down from my cousin Theresa.) Plus I had engine oil and grease on my face because it had got on my hands and I kept smelling it because it smelled good.I could see her cranking herself up into an end of the world as we know it fit, but my dad saved me.  He saved me because when he came around the side of the car it was obvious that he'd been driving Three Sheets To The Wind, as my mom always put it.  So the fit that was meant for me turned into she got angry at him for driving Three Sheets To The Wind and she blew up and it was like an atomic bomb. I got totally forgotten about AGAIN.  So HA on everybody!  I rule everything!"},
{"title": "I deliberately ate glitter one time, but it didn't turn out how you'd think it would.", "date": "Sunday, October 15, 2017", "text": "Told in the style of Lynda Barry and I hope she sees it too.This has been bugging me and bugging me for 100 YEARS ever since I saw the 'Poodle With a Mohawk' poster plastered all over Hells' half acre in Seattle Washington.  OK well it first started bugging me after seeing her strip in The Stranger, but it changed with the poodle thing ANYWAY.This is what's been bugging me:LYNDA BARRY DELIBERATELY DRAWS SHITTY.But she's completely screwing herself, and here's why. She's so good at drawing fake shitty that every now and then she slips and draws something, just a little corner of something, really well and it TOTALLY gives her away.  She could be drawing so many things acceptably but she's deliberately drawing badly. Plus!   Her people in the comics have really really bad grammer from the 1960's. But even then!  Every now and then she can't help it maybe but I think she totally is doing it deliberately - she writes a really good passage, and while she thinks 'Whoo, deal with that flash of incredible brilliance!' it's actually so obviously like \"See, I have superfucking mad skills when I want to but I just don't want to because you couldn't handle it\" but AHA ya mothercluckerbucker, because see, that really, really means \"I freak out when I think of actually doing things well all the time because then I'd be held to that standard and no way in blazing hell am I going to be able to bring it 100% of the time so I'll just dole it out in dribs and drabs and people will think Man, this is such an incredible work of urban primitive art/literature\". Also in her mind she's thinking \"Everyone can draw a table lamp and make it look like a table lamp, and a few people can draw a table lamp and make it look like a photograph, but nobody cares because it's a table lamp when everythings' said and done.  But when I deliberately shittify a drawing of a table lamp it's because that's my shtick...the shtick I lean on so I don't have to worry about being judged by my artwork because see it's already bad so ha on you.This having been said, Lynda Barry, you are one of my top 3 favorite writers of all time forever.  But you should quit being all plastic and phony and draw right for a change so people can tell what the fuck they're looking at.  And you should start using regular drawing things like a pencil or a pen instead of a tree branch.  OK."},
{"title": "Noodles, Where Are We Going?", "date": "Wednesday, March 8, 2017", "text": "Shortly after we moved into our present home, I began noticing that there was something 'off' about the folks living next door.  It was a combination of things, like the wildly untended yard, or the aerial walkway through the trees and around the house someone had cobbled together for the use of the ten or so white cats that lived there.  In the late gloom of evening, it was an eerie sight; these cats walking slowly about in seeming midair. Then there was the graveyard.  About thirty or so white crosses jammed into the soil between the house and the garage, moving slowly, death by death, toward my property line.Relax.  It was an animal graveyard.  Not a Pet Semetary, sorry.  It didn't need to be a Pet Semetary because all the other weird in combination would have overshone it's evil Pet Semetariness.Like the mysterious guy who started living in their garage.  Just showed up one night.  He'd step out sometimes on a warm summer evening and take a steaming elephant-piss back and forth across the blackberries that covered a good part of the garage and the backyard.  I don't know what this guy ate, but what he baptized stayed dead as fuck.  And this is the mighty Himalayan Blackberry we're talking about - the god-king of all invasives. You could hear this guy from indoors at my place as he cut loose like a fire hose.  I peeked a couple of times, but they were quick peeks.  One day he disappeared.  I did not ask.The family of five that lived there were not too visually peculiar; you'd see them buying huge sacks of Cheetos and Purina Critter Chow at the store, looking a bit wore out and unwashed, but this is farm country, and we all look like that.Let's look closer, shall we?  Mom was a trembling wraith, like a Grey in a wig.  She refused to speak. I know this from the few times I tried to visit...all she did was stare at me until I left her line of vision - then she'd scream for her daughter to go see what the visitor wanted. You could see her in there as you passed when the light shone a certain way, just sitting, wearing a nightgown and a stole made of live rats, serenely pissing in place until you could smell it across the street.  You could see the marks on the floor where they overflow had turned into an amber colored, syrup-ish, fiendish form of adhesive.  The bottom half of the chair didn't come up when they lifted, so they took a hammer, broke it apart and slung it out the door.  There was another spot just like that in the kitchen, where I'm assuming Dad had his throne, you'll excuse the pun.  The place where his armchair had been was a square of hardened piss-glue and old fecal matter from various sources, sunk an inch or more into the linoleum, which was black and fuzzy and had danger tape around it.  Linoleum did not come in black and fuzzy.  You can look it up.His chair made it into the side yard in one piece.  One piece that had been tunneled and eaten and rotted black and molded over with blue freakiness, a ghastly pit of tobacco colored horror marking the spot where his Highness sat steeping in his own whiz.While Dad was still in residence, his only form of daytime entertainment involved an occasional waddle out to the side yard in nothing but his huge, stretched-out, baggy jockey shorts, bringing up faint memories of the cattle ring at the county fair - where he'd poke at the dirt with a rake. Nothing about this was beautiful or appropriate.There were two separate camps which arose to explain his sudden disappearance:  1.  He abandoned the family and went to Arizona, or 2.  The rats got him .  Once the developer breaks ground, I guess we'll find out.  Either way the guy is going to freak out when all those skeletons are unearthed.  Maybe one will have a gold tooth...? (Fried Green Tomatoes reference. Is so clever!)The twin brothers would sometimes appear during the daytime, and I'd wave and be a nice neighbor, hand them a beer, you know.  They smelled like an old bookshop full of used hamster shavings, but they were OK.Sis I have written about. I wrote about the time she picked a dead cat up off the road and strolled home with it, talking to it and petting it all the while, causing huge swathes of cat fur to slough off marking her trail all the way to the front door. I wrote about the times I'd seen her out mowing the field in a mans' deep-cut sleeveless t-shirt, a  gargantuan boob swinging cheerily out either armhole.I wrote about the times she'd cut loose at 2am in hair-raising, werewolf howls, screaming and growling incomprehensibly. I've recounted the episodes when she'd stand at the back window and have vicious screaming arguments with the pear tree.  (When she was capable, that woman could cuss like a bag full of cats.)When she was in her right mind, her personality was that of a quiet 6 year old girl. Once her father disappeared mysteriously, she began to get normal enough to hold down a job, and she's been doing better and better ever since. Another tale I've written already was about the time their tame rats (wild and pet stock; any rat that wandered in was welcome to learn how to take a Cheeto daintily from the lips of Sis....shudder) tried to move into our house, their little ratty minds having learned to associate the human voice with the dinner bell.  They begged prettily, in a semicircle, like little poodles of evil while my husband barbecued steaks on the grill...they ambled in though the dog door whenever they felt the need for a snack, languidly sunned themselves in my front yard, licking their balls, scratching themselves; and the resultant Mad Biker rampage through the house with a broom and a shotgun.What I never realized that as desolate as things looked outside, what was going on in that house was so very, very much worse.When the buyer came over to speak with me, he asked me if I wanted to see inside.  I was already halfway to the door, because I have no sense whatsoever.  Old fucked up hazmat house full of filth?  Color me there!It goes without saying that there were places of lunatic carpentry attempts where the roof, wall and floor had been completely eaten away by rainfall.  A couple had ferns growing out of them.  I'm all for bringing the outside in, so let's move on.The entire house, with the exception of a few items, was empty. Stopped in time at 1955.  From that time onward, nothing had been touched, cleaned, swept - nothing.  The old wallpaper, once beautiful, was shadowed over and brown with age. This aspect creeped the shit out of me until I realized that it had all been covered with cardboard boxes pushed tight to the wall and towering all the way up to the ceiling.Anything that could be outlined by horror was outlined with horror. Horror with hairs all stuck in it. And cast snake skins.  And white cat hair. You could tell exactly what had occupied the spot by the perfect outlines left.  And everything that was wide enough for a turd held multitudes of them and dared you to play 'Guess the Poopie'.The only stink in the place was ammonia.  Like on Jupiter, the underlying single note of ammonia, motherfucker, mingled in various amounts with the signature pee aromas produced by incontinent humans, dogs, cats, snakes, rats, bearded dragons, more cats, way more rats, possums, rabbit pee, rabbit eau du love squit, raccoon pee, more possums and other various creatures created a series of invisible, semi-stationary atmospheric continents of OH GOD FUCK THIS.  Ask anyone from Jupiter.  They'll tell you.  Some spots on Jupiter, you can screw up your resolve and tolerate because fuck, dude, you're on Jupiter right?  But others are...not...vacation territory.Of course, the smell was only part of the horror.  Let me draw you a little word picture here so you understand what I mean.Two story house.  Downstairs, you've got people and random creatures pissing where and when they would, ambling around, eating Cheetos and admiring their stacks of cardboard boxes.Upstairs...upstairs was where the rats lived.Because rats have no thumbs and cannot play video games, they chew on things.  They are mad bastards for chewing on things.  They don't care what they chew on.  They don't eat half of it anyway, they just leave rat saliva-coated chew-flitters heaped up in random places for whatever ratty reason.  The second story was their kingdom.  They had the run.  The water was left trickling in the bathroom sink in case they wanted a drink, and the toilet was, I don't know, their rat spa or something.  I think they used the tub for some kind of rat initiation ceremony, because why the fuck not.  A couple times a week the humans would tear open a bag of Purina Vermin Chow and sling it across the floor up there. And thus, the rats were good.  The rats were taken care of.But since they were rats without video games, they began chewing.  The rug.  The linoleum.  The underlayment.  The baseboards. The insulation.THE WALLS.ALL THE WALLS UPSTAIRS HAD BEEN CHEWED AWAY TO THE BARE STUDS. Floor to ceiling.  Gone.  Only the nails left.  Those, and flitters. They'd started on the ceiling by the time moving day hit, so there were a few meandering holes...but oddly, the walls and ceiling of the stairs that lead up to their kingdom had been left alone, for the most part.The paint on the stairs was 1940's Apple Green.  Just one coat.  But bubbled and heaved; almost as though there was gravel beneath it.  There wasn't.It was caused by what was above the stairs.The ceiling sloped upward, as stairway ceilings do.  In the center of the wallboard there on the ceiling of the stairway, ran a long, stained, sagging black fissure with black...something...dangling from it.  In that one spot, there on the stairs, was the worst stink I have ever encountered. Ever.The rats had been enjoying themselves over the years by scrambling up and down the slanted boards that backed the stair ceiling, like an antic game of Let's be Rats and Run Up and Down Slanted Boards.  And remember, as rats go along, like mice, they piddle constantly. Drip drip drip.Now imagine a person living up there on the second floor.  Every time they walked up that stairway, the paint of which was so saturated by rat pee that it came off in spots and then was glued back on over the years whenever someone trod on it, our stair climber was also being showered every day, every night, by a constant mist of warm rat piss.  Yes.  The weird black dangling crud?  Was made of melting wallboard and rat pee.The sister lived up there. On a mattress on the floor.  And she didn't sleep alone, either.No go enjoy your dinner."},
{"title": "Your Face Sounds Familiar Like Soup", "date": "Sunday, February 26, 2017", "text": "Having just spent four whole days in North Carolina, I think it's safe to say that I have gained a certain expert insight concerning the unique culture of this state.      My visit took me to the Winston-Salem Greensborough area, which I was given to believe is just as South as South can be, so naturally I was excited to visit a plantation to watch the cotton being harvested as I reclined in  the shade of the veranda, sipping a julep, listening to someone play 'Nearer My God To Thee' on a spinet somewhere in the cool depths of the manor house, my willowy form caressed by a silken gown worn over a corset laced to the 'near death' setting.     Unfortunately that was not to be the case.  Only very silly persons believe in that outdated stereotype.  What I found was a generic urban culture nuked to the subsoil by Big Tobacco and chain restaurants.  There were evergreen trees,  everyones' speech was perfectly intelligible, no burning crucifixes that I noticed,  and nobody brandishing a straight razor even once chased me for lookin' at her wrong.      Don't let the signs fool you.  Yes, there are 32,456 Chick-Fil-A's in a 25 mile area, 4,501 Biscuitvilles,  and untold numbers of drive-through variations on the chicken waffle/biscuit/fried catfish/ food groups.  Yes, they are all decorated with delightful pictures of yesteryear and outdated agricultural implements; but once inside you find yourself in the same kind of neutral America that's spread all over the continent like margarine.-with the following exceptions.1. You can't get there from here.     The roads of the Winston Salem - Greensborough area were designed by the famous highway designer Sawyer Cormier, a Canadian acidhead whose medium was cooked spaghetti flicked at the wall until no more would stick. It really is that bad.  Worse than downtown Seattle.  And that's really bad.       For reasons unknown, those who decide decided to take a bowl shaped chunk of played-out tobacco farmland between Winston Salem and Greensborough and pave it over with - no shit -  vast looping 12 - lane highways that don't really go anywhere in a great big hurry.  In this same area are 87,500,986 shopping malls.  Huuuuuuuge shopping malls.  Three story multi-acre shopping malls.  (And you can't find your way around in them either! They have maps...they just don't have the little 'you are here' indicator.  Yay!)  The state mascot is the majestic Traffic Berm. Fuckers are everywhere.    Now as for malls... Each mall contains the same retail theme, adjusted for budget. Seven giant jewelry stores, 565 womens' clothing stores, 65 shoe stores, 400 mens' clothes and furnishings outlets, and at least one regal Romanian woman selling exfoliant and moisturizer at 175.00 the pop.  (One of these gorgeous women grabbed me by the arm and exfoliated me, in fact. It was a shock and awe exfoliation. Being covered in a fine layer of brick-orange dust as everyone and everything is in this area, I was  7 shades lighter after she'd finished which was kind of embarrassing.  Still, during her spiel, as she scoured my arm to get rid of all the gravel and old tires and loose, dead skin and stale lunch meat, I realized that her magic elixir was merely a mixture of Purel and ground walnut shells.  Talk about brass balls.)          The next mall down the line will have the same profile, only it's stores will be genuine upscale brand outlets and not filled with Chinese knockoffs.  And no matter what, there will be at least two beauty supply superstores.  Not outlets.  Not storefronts.  Stores the size of an airport parking lot. In addition there will be 56,709 different kinds of salon and specialty purveyors of things like feather eyelashes, threading parlors, foot spas, and nail artists offering the most exquisitely baroque treatments imaginable; straight, short, long and downcurved, rounded, stilleto sharp, stick-on, ultraviolet - hardened, dangly charms, your kids' pictures, money nails crafted out of actual currency, diamond studding, and other stuff I had no idea people did to their fingernails.2.  This one fucked with me bad.  Random wads of human hair litter the stores, parks, roadsides and sidewalks.  Scared the crap out of me.3. A meal is not a meal unless it's a uniform light tan.      Typical breakfast/lunch/dinner:  a biscuit, a meat, grits, toast, a flubby waffle, 'regular' syrup (maple, but you have a choice of butter pecan, Karo and some kind of mystery berry) over all and your choice of sides which threw me for a loop since didn't you already have three sides going on  there on your plate?  But no.  You have to choose from a list of more grits, another biscuit, hush puppies (breaded and fried witchety grubs as far as I could tell) eggs, bacon, coleslaw, mashed potatoes, baked potatoes with your choice of toppings, white gravy, brown gravy, several variations of the fried potato, and occasionally tomato slices.  This is way too many choices to make when you have low blood sugar.  Tell you what, though, once you've finished this homage to starch, that situation WILL change like a punch to the sternum.3.  This area is where the video game 'Grand Theft Auto' was rehearsed before it went to the storyboard, which is a lie but should be true.     There is no speed limit.  I am telling you the Gods' truth. You can drive past a cop on two wheels with gurning children packed in the back package tray and all it merits is a lazy wave.  Naturally it didn't take us long to test this, and it's true as shit:  you can pretty much do whatever you want at whatever speed you want as long as nothing catches fire.  Like stopping in the middle of the road, turning off your engine, putting on your emergency blinkers and proceeding to text at length.  Yes, we really saw this.  Several times.      The roads themselves are just as awful as those in Oregon, and that's pretty awful. Apparently level macadam is for the weak.  Everyone seems to take this in stride; life is short and cars are made to get from point a. to point b.     If  the car is making loud blubbadubbaduh noises, or parts of the car are missing, or are held on with zip ties, pop rivets, colored duct tape, nylon rope or clear cargo wrap, drive on.  As far as the police are concerned, as long as said car can move down the road it's all good.     And yes - people actually do take residential air conditioners and mount them in car windows with butyl caulk and plywood.4. It is perfectly legal to whip a bitch. State law.     We took advantage of this every time we went out just because it felt so dirty. For those of you who don't know what whipping a bitch is, it means if the road is wide enough,  you can go ahead and rip that steering wheel 'round like Dukes of Hazzard, at speed, and head back where you came from.  It is a GAS.  (And totally illegal in Washington.)  Traffic berms mean nothing.  Hell, if you find yourself headed in the wrong direction and think you can make it over a traffic berm, godspeed.  If you get high centered, put it in neutral, get out and push until your car drifts into the opposite lane, then run like hell and dive into the front seat.Yup.  Saw it.5.  Women driving fully accessorized luxury cars are the queens of the road.      You give way.  It's simple self-preservation. These ladies do what they want.  They want to drive up onto wide traffic berms, shut off their car and text.  They want to drive as fast as they feel like going, which is usually really really fast. The turning lane is the lane they want to make a turn from. They do NOT want to wait at a stop light because stop lights do not apply to them so they romp on the gas and 4-wheel it through the decorative roadside plantings to go around the line.  Mall parking lots are made deadly by these ladies, many of whom haven't been able to see over the dashboard for 30 years. 6.  The dirt is pumpkin orange.  Honest to snot pumpkin orange.      All the topsoil got scraped off by the developers, leaving only the red clay substrate, which turns bright orange as it dries out.  I kept wondering where everyone was getting all the colorful bark mulch but no, it was just dirt. And since it is clay dirt...7.  Nearly everything is built out of brick.  It's like being on a huge military base.8. Do not expect the bathrooms to have been cleaned below knee level.      I go to the bathroom a lot.  I'm 57.  It's what I do. I know when shit has been cleaned and this shit hadn't been cleaned.  Anywhere. Anyplace. Like, not even in the Museum of History.  The crud on the bathroom floor was historic but I don't think that's an excuse.9.  Old Salem Village is awesome.  Read about it's awesomeness here:  http://www.oldsalem.org/     Yes, people who work there dress in period costume, but you are not required to interact with them as though they were ghosts out of the past.  I even heard one say 'fuck'.  It was cool.10.  Housing is super inexpensive.      For what we paid for The Rancho 20 years ago, the kids  were able to purchase a residence in the tony district of town with a full daylight basement, a Wolf gas stove, a marble bath, and pecan hardwood floors.11.  Most people answer to no standard of taste but their own.      Roseann Roseannadanna, Cleopatra, Patti Smith, Lady Gaga, Billy Preston, Lil' Mama, Clint Eastwood, Jay Z, Landro Calrissian, that Mexican guy in Men In Black who turned out to be an alien holding a head on a stick - anything you can imagine;  everyone colorful like birds of paradise, all sparkling with diamonds and jangling with 'notice me' jewelry.  The only cultural uniform I saw was worn by older men of a certain political bent: small check shirts with pearl buttons, high waist slacks, pointy boots, and a spankin' new bill cap.     That's about all I have to say about that.  We were thinking about moving there to be closer to the grandkids, but after having visited we realized that there was no way in hell we wanted to live there.  The flight itself was unpleasant in the extreme (fuck you and your seats of stone, Delta Airlines) much less the thought of hauling all our crap across the continent to live near a woman who, God love her, still goes off like a human stomp rocket because some utterly random thing tickled her crack.The grandkids are fine. They are fine. So be it."},
{"title": "Medical Examiner Dr. Qin  ", "date": "Wednesday, February 1, 2017", "text": "You cannot change channels on your television using a phone.*I keep trying, and it keeps not working.One of these days, though, it won't work and I'll forget to give a shit.  Until someone figures out that I finally succumbed to Altzheimers and it's not just one of my usual days, I'll have a nice, long conversation with the charming characters on the Cartoon Network.  And I'll learn valuable lessons too. Like today, for example.  Today I learned that the cartoon Stephen Universe is basically about space lesbians teaching a hippie kid how to fight other space lesbians.Does anybody get this channel? Has anyone else seen this cartoon series?  Am I the only one to notice this?  It's like when Aerosmith sang 'Walk This Way' during the Superbowl and nobody in America except me realized that it's a song about eating pussy and cousin humping. I have no problems with space lesbians. I think space lesbians awesome.  But the artists are reeeeealy pushing the envelope.  For example, in one episode, when we went into the heart of the Temple, that wasn't a heart we saw...the Gems were using a poetic euphemism for what was clearly a uterus blooping away overhead with a discreet vagina tucked back amidst all the tubes it was attached to. Also tacit is the fact that Stephens father  (Gregg Universe) and mother (Rose Quartz) were not married when lil' Stephen was conceived.  Hell, they weren't even from the same planet.  So that's two for two - Stephen is the product of unmarried interplanetary miscegenation.The Crystal Gems allied with Stephen are Garnet, Pearl and Amethyst.  They are extraordinarily violent, do not sit like ladies,  and live in a huge stone temple with a postmodern beach house built in it's lap.  There is also a pink lion, but I never have been entirely sure of it's role...mostly they use it as a closet, or as a passage into other realities, sort of like the coat closet to Narnia, only a lion. The reason the Gems are here is that they are protecting the earth from Homeworld, where Diamond-grade alien women rule and all the lesser gem women do all the shit work.  Garnet, Pearl and Amethyst (and Rose Quartz, before she dissolved to become half of Stephen) are all that stand between us and annihilation by some extremely pumped, holier-than-thou space bitches with superior technology.The lesser Gems are able to fight back, though.  They possess the ability to fuse into beings much stronger than the sum of their parts. Some episodes when this happens there's lots of explosions and violence, which I am all for. Most of the time, though, Fusions occur in episodes that are just weird for weirds' sake, which I am all for.For example, whenever Garnet, a tall woman with square hair, undergoes an unusually traumatic event, she divides into two separate women...Ruby and Sapphire, whom upon reunion straight up get to suckin' serious face with each other before they re-fuse in order to form Garnet again.  Stephen himself, a half earth - half alien boy, is able to fuse with his best friend Connie, an Earth girl.  When this happens, he/they turn(s) into an adult woman with a pretty decent rack. I could go through and nitpick all the Easter eggs and 'gotta be an adult to get it' details I've caught while watching this show, but what we need to bear in mind here is that I spend entirely too much time watching Cartoon Network.____________________________*Likewise, you cannot make phone calls on your remote."},
{"title": "Super Talk Show / 超级访问 !!!!!", "date": "Monday, January 16, 2017", "text": "Because I hate the cold, and the weather here has been in the 20f range with hurricane-worthy wind gusts, I've spent the better part of the last two months indoors, going nowhere but the pharmacy and the local grocery store.  After the gardening hyperactivity of March to early November, it's actually been quite nice to just sit here on my dead ass, reading Lovecraft, listening to obscure music, and watching demented shit on Syfy.  In fact, I didn't realize how much I needed an extended period of simple inactivity until I realized that I was recovering from an injury I didn't know I'd had until I regained full range of movement in my left arm._________________________Let's go back....back in time....Year before last, I had a job.  It was incredibly physically demanding, but I was up. Hell yeah!  Unfortunately, not all my internal organs agreed with that decision.  This is why I passed out briefly behind the wheel, just an instant, only to come to a moment later to find myself clanging off the drivers side door as I ran off the road and down a steep bank smack into a drainage ditch. Instead of screaming  - I don't even thing I said 'fuck' once - I started repeating \"No barbed wire, please, no barbed wire, please, no barbed wire..\"Don't ask me where my sudden presence of mind came from; it's a rare enough occurrence anyway without finding myself in the middle of a car accident, but I floored it and steered into the slides as I rocketed through wet, mucky corn fields followed by a ten-foot rooster tail of mud,  dodged my way through a stand of alder, shot down a creek bed, blew straight through a brush pile - I actually caught air a couple of times as I flew up and over a couple of hay lanes - until finally I found a driveway in good enough shape to get me back onto the road.  Pedal still mashed to the floor, I drifted into a hard left and went screaming back up onto the road, hitting a car as I passed over the center line, and ended up parked in a farmers' turn-around on the opposite side of the road wondering what the fuck had just happened. I have to admit; danger aside, it was a blast.  So yes, I was very confused at that point.  Confused yet exhilarated.  I got out of my car and looked at the front....hallelujia!  No barbed wire!!A Polish gentleman pulled up alongside me as I stood leaning in woozy relief against my car.   Turns out he was the man driving the car I'd hit.\"Have you been drinking?\" he asked.  I looked at him in amazement.  There was a long pause while I searched for the speech center in my brain.  \"Who are you?\"  I asked, finally.\"That don't matter.  You hit my car. Not be worries.  My car is piece of shit.  Are you drinking? Are you feel ok?\"I finally processed this.  \"Oh!  No!  I think I fell asleep or something...I've been up since 4 am.  I think I'm OK...are you?\"He reassured me.  \"No worry then. My car drives. It's just piece of shit, don't even worried.  I don't smell no alcohol on you.  Just as long as you not been drinking the alcohol OK. And can drive?  Then I leaved  Don't worries my car, ok?  Is just a piece of shit.\"Now, I hadn't just tapped his car.  I'd pleated the whole thing right down the drivers side.It took a few moments to realize that, because he hadn't been lying - his car truly was a piece of shit.  It lacked any recognizable paint as well as a passengers' side front quarter panel, and he was using red duct tape in place of lenses over the backup lights.  He was more worried about the insurance angle than I was!It turns out I was able to drive home.  My car had no damage WHATSOEVER...just a lot of mud swept up and over the roof, some brush up in the wheel wells and a big willow branch caught in the front bumper that I swept the street with all the way home.  I had just chucked it into the compost when the Biker drove in.  The only thing he noticed was the mud, and I told him - truthfully! - that I'd gone through a couple of big puddles.I got away with this like a BOSS.The Biker never had a clue.  The next morning bright and early I pressure washed the undercarriage and engine compartment, checked the radiator, oil and gas - no leaks, no ponks, no scratches, no nothing. The only shred of evidence that I'd gone on Mr. Toads wild ride is that the hard rubber bumper guard on the passengers' side was shiny instead of coated in filth like my car usually is.Friends and neighbors, I highly recommend the 1989 Buick Regal. It is a BEAST.I quit my job that night.  I drove the car for a couple more months until the Biker decided to sell it.  We made 200.00 over the original price.I went to the doctors and found out why I'd passed out.  Turns out I was near kidney failure for lack of hydration and over-work *snif*.  Fainting is one of the symptoms. I started hydrating like a mad bastard, and that took care of that.  But my shoulder? I had been unconscious just long enough to realize that when I'd first gone off the road and smacked myself against the drivers' door I'd bruised the shit out of my left rotator cuff. At least, not until, after the past few months of inactivity, it got better!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, January 8, 2017", "text": "How To Tell If There's Nothing Going On In Your House That A Swift Kick And A Couple Of Prozac Won't Fix  Firstly, do you live in a mobile home?  Congratulations!  You are not haunted! Not even if there is blood streaming down the mail slot in the front door and you are sited atop a Victorian Era grave full of  deformed infants and grimoires.  1.  Do you hear a baby crying and you don't have a baby?  Congratulations!  You are not being haunted by a baby!  If you live in the Pacific Northwest, what you have is a opossum. 2.  Do you hear what sounds like cinderblocks or stones being whipped super hard at the walls or any other part of the house?   My Advice:  Check the neighborhood for unsupervised boys between the ages of 5 and 20. If you actually find objects -rocks, fruit, cinderblocks, etc. you have an infestation of unsupervised boys3. Does your cat stare at one spot for an hour or more, hissing and yowling, with it's fur standing up?My Advice:  Ignore. Cats are insane.4. Does your dog stare at one spot for an hour or more, whimpering or growling, with it's fur standing up? My Advice:   Your dog hangs around with your cat too much.5. Have you lost a beloved pet recently, and are now having experiences that seem as though that pet still resides with you in ghost form? My Advice:  This is not happening.  Let go already. I know this will garner cries of bereaved outrage and denial, to which I say buck the fuck up.  Fluffy is a' mouldering in her grave. POINT TO PONDER  Ever wonder why hauntings are limited to people, dolls, the occasional horse, dog, or cat, and Victorian homes?  Why don't you get haunted by the cows that gave their lives for your Happy Meal? And why are ghosts always (post)mammalian?  What about canaries, or tilapia, or road machinery?  Ever wonder why you aren't hip deep in the ghosts of cavemen?  Why don't the animals you run over with your car return to torment your nights with unexplained 'splut' noises?  I have no idea.  Neither do Penn and Teller, from whom I totally ripped this off.  6. Do you see 'shadow people' darting past?  You don't.  You see shadows, period.  This is an artifact of peripheral vision.  You might have a bat in the house, though.  Or a large moth.  EW.7.  Do you see small shadows darting past?  Congratulations!  Your house is infested with rats!8.  Do you wake up choking with a hideous old woman sitting on your chest?  Hooray!  This is a sleep disorder called 'Old Hag Syndrome'.  Go see a sleep specialist.  Problem solved.8. Do you wake up in the middle of the night with somebody breathing heavily near your face, and you sleep alone?   Hooray!  You have a mild case of sleep paralysis.  Your brain wakes up just an instant before your body gets the message; creating a sensory dissonance, and guess what?  You snore.  Yes you do.9. Digging up a lot of bones (non-human) when you garden?  Ignore. For some reason people think nothing of chunking bones out in the yard.10.  Old houses only: hearing loud banging noises indoors, infrequently and at any hour?  There are two answers to this.  1. You have steam heat.  2. You're losing fire stops ( short boards jammed between the wall studs), lumps of dried-out plaster, or forgotten sashweights.   These objects have been subject to decades of  rodent nibbling, leaks, and temperature fluctuations.  Usually at the worst possible moment one or the other of these objects will suddenly cut loose and clatter and bang down inside the wall. Yeah, that'll make you pee yourself. 11.  Do non-Victorian Era toys change locations unexpectedly?  You have children.12.  Does your baby laugh and giggle as though it were interacting with someone, but nobody is there?   You have a baby.   Babies do weird shit.13.  Do you see mysterious figures outside at night which seem to gaze intently at your house as though they were waiting?  These are unsupervised boys, and you have a teenage daughter.14.  Do you hear whispering, voices, screaming or growling that nobody else hears?  You have schizophrenia.15.  Are you possessed by an evil entity? No you are not.  You are mentally ill.  The right  combination of therapy and drugs make this shit stop dead, pun intended.  Note:  If you have fugue states during which you barf up lobsters and speak grammatically correct Latin?  Now we call Father McGillicuddy and grab a tarp.16.  Do you look out the window at night and upon occasion see a nasty fucked-up face mashed up against the other side of the glass going GUUUUUUUUUH UK BLUH PBBBBTH?  My Advice:  No matter what the explanation, the memory alone will ruin your homeowner experience at that address forever.  Pack and move.Don't forget to remember to tune in in a couple days for the final installment of the 'Dealing With The Supernatural' series!!  I'll be covering issues like non-stick cookware, herpes zoster and the deadly consequences of stuff that is deadly!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, January 1, 2017", "text": "What To Do If You Ignored My Advice  Like A DipshitAnd Now Find Yourself Living With Unwanted Guests       1. Was the house built in the Victorian Era?Move.2.  Have you found a Victorian Era doll anywhere on the property, particularly if it was under the attic floorboards, or worse - inside the wall? My advice:   DO NOT KEEP IT.  It is not a charming relic of yesterday.  It is home to a homicidal demon!  Did you touch it?  OH GOD GO WASH YOUR HANDS IN RUBBING ALCOHOL!!! AW CRAP!!  RUN GO GET THE LAWNMOWER GAS CAN!!! OH SHIT!! OH FUCK!!  KILL IT WITH FIRE AND PUT IT OUT WITH HOLY WATER!!! 3.  Have you found a Victorian-Era picture of a porcelain doll under the attic floorboards? Or parts of one? Or a Victorian Era dolls' shoes, or clothes, or furniture, or anything having to do with a Victorian Era doll?  Worst of all, have you come across a portrait of a child holding a Victorian Era doll?  GAH!!! See  #1.4.  Did a Victorian-Era child younger than ten years old die mysteriously in the house? Victorian-Era dead children go from mischievous to aggressively creepy really fast. A generic 'go toward the light' exorcism usually gets them to move on.5.  Do you see transparent figures that speak, hiss, growl, have eyes, touch you or drip blood?My Advice:  Reciprocate by utilizing the Kerosene and a Match solution. 6.  Did a woman from the Victorian Era die mysteriously in the house? My Advice:  Unless you enjoy the prospect of seeing her transparent form on the stairs, sobbing in the basement,  looking out the second-story window, at the foot of your bed every night, or bugging your toddler, MOVE NOW.     Note:  Some dead Victorian-Era women are amenable to a 'go toward the light' type exorcism.  Do not call in a priest.  If the wraith in question was not Catholic in life, the exorcism will only piss her off. This is never good.7.  Did a nice yet reclusive Victorian Era farmer die in the house?  No worries. 7a. Did a mean farmer from the Victorian Era live as a recluse in the house until he passed?My Advice:  Even in the absence of phenomena, you have a ghost, and he is still mean, and you will soon have phenomena.  That's just how it works.  Mean Victorian-Era farmer-recluses are also the source of sudden, inexplicable, well-defined areas of hot monkey butt aromas, as they probably were in life come to think of it.  A stern, non-denominational exorcism is occasionally effective. Fire is more effective.8. Did a mean, reclusive farmer from the Victorian Era die in the house only to be found months or even years later?My Advice:  Go to the gas station and fill an appropriate container with kerosene, pour it liberally about the structure, and toss in a lit match.  Victorian-era mean farmers that died and didn't get found for awhile cannot be reasoned with and cannot be exorcised.  They can only be cleansed from this our mortal realm with flame.Note on mean Victorian Era farmers:  If the dead gentleman in question can be proven beyond any doubt to have been Catholic in life, devout or no, he can be permanently expelled by a mega-hardcore, big guns Catholic exorcism.  Mean Irish Priests are particularly effective officiants.  9. Have you found statues, relief decorations, dolls, old newspapers, photographs or paintings with gouged-out eyes?   My Advice:  These are not creepy things that you keep to show to people how fucked up your judgment is to be living in a house made of pure evil.  See #6.  The sooner the better with this kind of demented shit.10.  Have you found ineradicable evidence on your floor of multiple, evenly-spaced candles having been placed in a circle? My Advice:  Hold an 'exorcism lite' and then put a rug over the spot.11. Was the wax red or black? HOLY FUCKBALLS you have been infested with demons from the moment you signed the deed.  These are the 'float up off the bed, head spinning around, vomiting blenders' type demon. They dig in like ticks and will follow you from house to house playing this shit until you get a straight-up standard Catholic exorcism.  Yes it has to be Catholic.  It generally isn't a very pretty process.  Lay down a tarp first.12.  Have you found a puzzling amount of salt all over the place, oil stains in the shape of crosses over all the doorways, hearths and windows, crucifixes nailed in unlikely places (like over the foundation vents or behind the washing machine)?  Although these can be gateway objects for demonic shit, sometimes all they are is evidence that an exorcism took place and was successful.  My Advice:   Leave this stuff the fuck alone.  Don't touch it.  Not even with a sock over your hand or a long stick or a Swiffer Sweeper.  Wait for signs of haunting.  If you experience signs of haunting, then act as in #11....and yes, I really have walked into an empty house where all this shit was present. 13. Do you own lots of dolls and display them proudly? My advice:  Out they go AT ONCE.    Burning is strongly advised.Please grab a clue. Dolls are icky. Even though your friends tell you how cute they are, none of them like your dolls. Nobody human wants to walk into a home and find themselves surrounded in every room by haystacks of cobwebby frou-frou  from which 456,000 little shiny eyeballs are glaring.  Furthermore, all of your friends think you have some kind of an emotional issue  because you choose to decorate with dollies.  Please; are you six?-And remember:  dolls are the #1 preferred dwelling place for ghosts and demons.  Particularly if the dolls in question are from the Victorian Era. 14. Strangely, taxidermy are immune to supernatural habitation. Yes I am using taxidermy as a collective noun.  There's nothing you can do about it. I think it's because taxidermy are just creepy from the get-go.  In past times it was de rigueur to greet guests with a hearty \"Here, Aloysius, do let me show you my collection of embalmed animals posed in a lifelike manner!\" But not any more. Dried frogs dressed like mariachis or mice in period dress serving tea are not creepy.  They are awesome.15.  Are you a devout Catholic with all the trimmings displayed prominently and en masse?   Cut your collection down to a plain crucifix and maybe a tasteful statue of Mary stomping on a snake.  You do not need a holy water stoup in the bathroom.  (and yes, I've seen this.)  A whole gang of Catholic trappings can become a portal to hell in an instant.  If you aren't haunted, you will be soon.  Don't court trouble.16.  Has a cryptic object appeared from nowhere in a very prominent place, like the middle of your bed, and you don't have a cat and it isn't a hairball?  Don't touch it.  Drape a couple squares of toilet paper over the object in question and then pick it up with a spatula and sling it across the street into the neighbors yard.  It works with slugs; it'll work with a tarnished silver pig penis with Latin inscriptions all over it.17.  Do Victorian-Era toys mysteriously change locations?  My Advice:  It doesn't matter if you found them and kept them, or bought them off EBay; either way you brought this on yourself.  Your ass is so haunted.  See my advice about child ghosts at #3. and also review #1, particularly if the toys in question start bleeding or speaking.Can't move out right away? 18.  Take the closet doors off in all the bedrooms. The Supernatural just loves to dick around with doors in general and bedroom closet doors in particular. If this is too much trouble, at least WD40 the hinges so that when a closet door does open in the middle of the night, the phenomena is robbed of it's signature scary creaking;  thus you stand a 50/50 chance of sleeping through the whole 'terrifying thing in the closet' scenario, although experts agree you still only stand a 25% chance of sleeping through a full-on nocturnal door slamming episode.19.  Never leave an unattended glass filled with liquid in the kitchen. The supernatural cannot resist the urge to backhand glasses full of liquid left sitting in the kitchen.20.  Baby-lock all the cabinet and appliance doors in the kitchen.  The supernatural likes slamming doors in the kitchen as much as it likes slinging glasses of water and slamming closet doors.21.  Have you been silently beckoned by a ghostly figure?My Advice:  Go ahead.  Go right ahead and follow a ghostly figure who knows where and end up impaled on a hay rake, ya dipshit.  Go ahead.  Seriously, though, you don't want to see whatever it is.  Really.  You don't.22.  Victorian Era house:  Do you have a basement door? Remove the doorknob.  Stuff the hole with paper towels or a cork. Use a hasp lock on the outside of the door when the basement is not in use. Keep the key with you at all times. When you go downstairs, carry the lock and key in your hand. Do not set them down.  Just do it.  Even if there's nothing weird happening.  Just take my word for it.23.  Hear someone screaming in torment every night up in the attic/basement/garage/outbuilding/back bedroom?  Don't go see what it is, and definitely do not open any goddamn doors.  If it is in the same room as you are?  Well shit.  All you can do is save up your dimes and nickles until you can afford to move and in the meantime stock up on adult diapers or maybe sleep in another room.20.  Find a hidden cavity in the wall just big enough to stick your hand in?  Yeah.  You go ahead and do that and see what you pull back.  Situations like this are why Baby Jesus invented the long stick, doofus.21.  Do you feel as though a Victorian-era trunk you've found in the house or an outbuilding holds a great secret?  Do not open it.  Take the fucker to the dump immediately. I can tell you what's in it. A dessicated infant.  It's always a dessicated infant.  Or a canary wrapped in a handkerchief. 22.  Hear someone in the dirt-floored basement calling your name and  you are alone in the house?  Make sure the lock is secure and ignore that shit.  The certain way to let a horrifying psychotic killer demon into your life is to open the goddamn basement door when you hear shit down there while you're alone in the house.23.  Electrical objects turning themselves on all by themselves? You may have a poltergeist, in which case make all the people you live with who are going through puberty live with someone else until their butt hair comes in.  (Even if you are not experiencing any untoward phenomena you should probably do this anyway.) For safetys' sake, unplug any miscreant appliances or power tools, but take the chainsaw and leave that in the middle of the living room floor.  If you have just realized you have a poltergeist, think of how it will totally screw with the carrier-adolescent if they see a chainsaw in the middle of the floor one night and it suddenly turns itself on.  Serves the little bastard right!24.  Does thumping, knocking and banging seem to happen outdoors and indoors, frequently, at all hours, and without cause? You have an untethered poltergeist.  But guess what? You can make this stop.  Turn up the hip hop and ignore your neighbors' complaints.  Poltergeists hate anything recorded after 1951, including musicals and Sing Along With Mitch.Puttering about the yard:1. Have you found a 'Crown of Thorns' bush?  Dig it up and burn it.  Crown of Thorn bushes are just....louche.2. Have you found a doll burial or burials?  Stab them onto a pitchfork and huck them into the neighbors' yard.2. Have you found a grave, or even a small graveyard on the property?  Leave it the fuck alone. I mean stand right up the instant you figure out what you've got and start piling leaves over it.  And brush.  Maybe put a derelict car on top.  Put up a fence on the side facing your house and pretend that it's the property line.  Never look in that direction at night.2. Have you found unusual items in an existing tool shed, like crucifixes drawn all over the walls or a trocar?  Kerosene and a match.  Now.....and yes, I have walked onto a property where one of the outbuildings was covered from floor to ceiling with crucifixes.3. Dig up a recently buried corpse?My Advice:  Notify the authorities.  Spontaneous vomiting, loss of consciousness and panic urination are OK. Move.4.  Digging up skeletonized human remains? My Advice:  Notify the authorities.  Sudden wooziness or total loss of consciousness and panic urination are OK. Move.5.  Dig up a human skull? My Advice:  Keep it.  Skulls are cool. Panic urination is OK as long as it is minimal. You have a 50/50 chance of sparking off a haunting by choosing to keep the skull, but if it were me I'd say it was a fair price to pay to have an actual human skull that you dug up. Clean thoroughly, then use it as a centerpiece on Thanksgiving.  Explain to your guests that it symbolizes how thankful we all should be to have the gift of life.  Try to make this sound as plausible as possible.6.  Dig up multiple human skulls? My advice:  Piss yourself forthwith, shit up your drawers, have a total mental breakdown on the spot and get somebody else to contact the authorities.  Then move.7.  Chop down any scary trees that touch the house.  You can be certain that somebody either hung themselves from that tree or dropped house pets down inside the hollow trunk or something fucked up along those lines.   Burn the wood OUTSIDE, not in your fireplace.__________________________________________     I hope you are learning from these helpful hints.  At the very least, what you should take away from this is please get rid of your skanky embarrassing doll collection that smells like old pancakes and grease.  This will make everyones life better."},

{"title": "General Manager Liu Laogen Brown Ferocious!", "date": "Tuesday, December 20, 2016", "text": "My mother was a highly superstitious, old-school Irish Catholic kind of mother, and as a consequence I grew up with an unshakable belief in the supernatural in general; and specifically, that my every move was being watched and weighed by a host of highly judgmental invisible beings, not all of  whom had my best interests at heart.  This had two effects on my childhood.The first was that I was inspired to create a fan-dance-like routine based on making sure none of the saints, angels, principalities, powers, Jesus, God, demons, Satan, or dead relatives acting as guardian angels would catch a glimpse of my horrifying grade-school bareness on the toilet or in the bath by cleverly manipulating towels and the shower curtain.The second was a strong inclination toward the morbid end of the entertainment spectrum. Book or movie, if it had a lot of gore and aliens and ghosts and Dracula and so forth, I was there, either reading under the covers and hoping the flashlight didn't give out, or sneaking out of my room at midnight to sit 3 inches from the T.V. screen with the sound down. Looking back, I have to wonder why I felt so compelled to subject myself to it.  Imagine midnight, and a totally freaked out little FirstNations holding her screaming pillow and watching, say, The Haunting, while a windstorm is shaking butternuts the size of geodes off a nearby tree to drop KLUNK on the roof at the worst possible moments during the story.  I had to scream into my screaming pillow because I was always too freaked out to move while the movie was playing. Oddly,  during the commercials I was suddenly able to dash (stealthily) to the bathroom if I had to.  This had to be accomplished without raising my eyes from the carpet, because I couldn't risk accidentally glancing at the bathroom mirror since I was certain I'd see something messed up standing behind me.  Done,  I dashed (stealthily, eyes on the carpet ) back into the front room just in time to see Julie Christie lose her shit. Cue screaming pillow and butternuts.I'm long past being terrified by much of anything anymore; but to this day I'll occasionally binge on stupid crap T.V. like Ghost Adventures:Zak:  Gasp! I just felt like something went through me!  Like a ghost or a being or something! I mean it! Get a closeup of my goosebumps!Aaron:  I feel sick, man. Like I'm going to....all of a sudden man!  I gotta go.  I gotta go outside (rising panic) I gotta get out NOW! *exuent Aaron clutching his gut* Nick: ...................................or on the huge collection of stories at The Shadowlands site:\"The bathroom faucet used to go on at night for no reason.  OK so the bathroom was to the right down the hall from my baby brothers' room next to the bloodstained stairs to the attic which were were on an angle to the left but you could see when the light would go on and off in there, and just to the right of my parents room next to the downstairs landing right by my room which overlooked the carport roof where a dark figure used to stand...\"I don't know what I get out of it to this day. What I do know, after a lifetime of this sad preoccupation, is how to deal with The Supernatural.  That's the subject of my next post.  And you have to wait for it.  So, yeah."}
